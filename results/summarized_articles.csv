The tiny fragments are released when larger plastic items break down in the environment and when they’re shed from plastic-containing packaging or materials during use. Increasingly, researchers are showing that microplastics can make their way into the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and elsewhere. What isn’t clear is whether they pose a health threat to people. Researchers reported recently that levels of plastic in the brain were higher in people who had dementia than in those who didn’t, but they don’t know whether the plastic contributes to dementia risk or if changes seen in dementia make the brain more susceptible to microplastic accumulation. In 2024, researchers found jagged microplastics and even tinier nanoplastics in the plaques in some people’s carotid arteries, and those people had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke or death, according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. In 2024, researchers published a review of evidence, mostly animal studies, that found exposure to microplastics is “suspected” to harm human digestive and respiratory health, including a potential link to colon and lung cancer. It’s “highly probable” that microplastics could harm human health, says Philip Kuriakose, M.D., a hematologist and medical oncologist at the Henry Ford Cancer Institute in Detroit. “But it hasn’t been fully proven yet.” The potential for health problems is particularly relevant for older adults, whose bodies are less able to repair the harm that plastics (and the chemicals they may contain) can do to the body, Kuriakose says. Exposure to microplastics could exacerbate existing health problems that are more common with age, such as heart disease and possibly vascular dementia, he says. Microplastics are everywhere – they’ve even been detected on Mount Everest – and it’s not practical to avoid them entirely. “We’re never going to be able to eliminate plastic exposures, and in some cases, we shouldn’t, because there’s a risk-benefit ratio for everything, and there are benefits of plastics,” says Douglas Walker, an associate professor in the Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health at Emory University, who studies microplastics. “But I do think we should have mindfulness about our plastic use.” Here are some relatively easy lifestyle changes that can help reduce your exposure, the researchers say: 1. Cut back on single-use plastics. Plastic pollution accumulates in the environment – including the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. You can do your part by following Walker’s top recommendation: Choose alternatives to the plastics you use once and then toss, such as plastic wrap, bags, cutlery and food and beverage containers, whenever possible. 2. Opt for water from the faucet rather than bottled. If you have access to clean tap water, it’s a better choice than buying bottled, says Britta Baechler, marine biologist and director of ocean plastics research at the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. One 2024 study found that an average liter of bottled water contained 240,000 tiny pieces of plastic, 90 percent of them the extremely tiny nanoplastics. While tap water also contains microplastics, bottled water has more, research has shown. That seems to be true even for water sold in glass bottles, suggesting microplastic particles are getting into the water through the packaging process, she says. “For me, that’s evidence to suggest that tap water is best for both you and the planet,” Baechler says. When you’re on the go, fill up a reusable stainless steel or glass bottle. Home-based water filtration is also an option. Look for a filter that has NSF/ANSI 401 certification, which means it can reduce the amount of microplastics in your water.

Learn, take action, build healthy habits 3. Don’t mix plastic containers and heat. Walker says he stores and heats up leftovers in a glass container rather than a plastic one. And when he buys foods meant to be heated up in their single-use plastic packaging, he transfers them to a microwave-safe dish or bowl, and then heats them. Some foods shouldn’t even be stored in plastic. For example, it’s a good idea not to store oil-rich foods in plastic containers or to let them come into contact with plastic wrap because the oil can cause the plastic to leach into food, Walker says. 4. Extend that caution to hot beverages. When your barista hands you coffee in a disposable cup, it’s most likely lined with plastic, even if it’s primarily made of paper. When hot liquid hits that plastic, it releases microplastics into your drink, research has found. Bring your own reusable, non-plastic cup, instead. (Bonus: Some coffee shops will give you a small discount if you BYOC.) Are you a tea drinker? Recent studies have pointed out micro and nanoplastics found in teabags, which can leach particles into the tea. Those kinds of findings “made me change my tea-drinking habits,” Baechler says. “I now use looseleaf tea in a reusable stainless-steel steeper.” 5. Look for alternatives to plastic cutting boards and cooking utensils. Chopping food on plastic cutting boards is a potentially “substantial” source of microplastics in food, according to a study reported in 2023 from the University of North Dakota. Other options include boards made of glass, marble, bamboo or wood. (Just be sure you understand how to clean and care for them properly.) Plastic cooking utensils such as spatulas can also be swapped out for metal or silicone. Don’t feel you have to get rid of everything in your kitchen immediately. “I do a little bit at a time, and then eventually I’ve taken a lot of [plastic] things out of my life,” says Tracey Woodruff, M.D., a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive sciences at UC San Francisco and an author of the 2024 review of evidence on microplastics and health. 6. Focus on minimally processed foods. You may have heard a lot about plastics in the ocean – more than 8 million tons of plastic flow from rivers and beaches into the ocean every year, according to the UN Environment Program, and that plastic is gobbled up by the seafood we eat. But fish and shellfish aren’t the only protein source of microplastics. A study published in 2024 looked at 16 types of protein that people commonly eat, including fish and shellfish, pork, beef and chicken, and plant-based proteins such as tofu and meat replacements. “We found there’s no difference in concentration of microplastics,” says Baechler, an author on that study. She and colleagues found at least some microplastics in 88 percent of the samples. One way to trim back on the microplastics you eat: steer clear of processed foods, which had more microplastics than lightly processed foods, Baechler says. And when you shop, try to avoid plastic packaging when possible, Kuriakose says. 7. Vacuum and leave your shoes at the door. We inhale plastic particles indoors and out. In your home, a vacuum with a HEPA filter can get rid of some of the microplastics, which are present in dust, says Woodruff. Removing shoes at the door also cuts down on tracked-in dust from outdoors, she says. Synthetic fabrics can produce tiny plastic fibers, and dryers seem to disperse those into the air, one study found. To be on the safe side, when you pull the lint filter out of the dryer, clean it out directly over a trash bin and keep it as contained as possible, Baechler says. You can also buy fewer clothes made with synthetic fibers, to the degree that that’s practical. Bonus tip: Make yourself resilient in other ways. While you’re being mindful about your exposures, you can shore up your own defenses against all potential threats to your health, Woodruff says. That means adopting habits like a healthy diet, regular exercise, sufficient sleep and not smoking.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/rsv-symptoms-older-adults/,"7 Common Symptoms of RSV in Older Adults Plus, how to recognize if a mild infection is turning severe By Rachel Nania, Updated December 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 27, 2024 / Updated December 17, 2024 AARP (Source: Adobe Stock(2)) It’s the time of year when COVID-19 and flu are top-of-mind for many. But there’s another highly contagious respiratory virus that spreads in the fall and winter months, and similar to the coronavirus and influenza, this bug can be downright dangerous for older adults. It’s called RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus. And while it’s commonly thought of as an illness that affects babies and young children, RSV sends as many as 160,000 U.S. adults ages 60-plus to the hospital each year, and kills as many as 10,000 older Americans annually, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Doctors and public health experts are hopeful that a suite of new RSV vaccines can help keep these numbers down this year. Health officials recommend that everyone 75 and older get an RSV vaccine﻿ if they didn’t get one when the shots first became available in 2023. The vaccine is also recommended for people 60 to 74 who have underlying health conditions, like chronic heart and lung disease. What are the symptoms of RSV? A mild infection RSV can be tricky to identify, since its symptoms tend to mirror those of other respiratory illnesses, including flu and COVID, says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. While infants and babies with RSV tend to display signs of lethargy, apnea (pauses in breathing) and loss of appetite, the infection in older adults can come with a runny nose, congestion, cough, fatigue, a mild headache and fever. Adults can also have a stuffy nose, sore throat and aches and pains, Schaffner says. ﻿7 Common RSV symptoms in older adults Congestion Cough Fever Lack of energy Mild headache Runny nose Sore throat Source: Cleveland Clinic When RSV turns severe While symptoms are usually mild in most, RSV can make some adults really sick, and older adults are at higher risk for complications from a respiratory virus, like RSV. So are individuals with heart and lung disease or a compromised immune system. RSV can cause lower respiratory infections like pneumonia and bronchitis, and it can worsen existing health conditions like asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and heart failure. ﻿7 Common RSV symptoms in older adults Congestion Cough Fever Lack of energy Mild headache Runny nose Sore throat Source: Cleveland Clinic According to Cleveland Clinic, some symptoms that signal an RSV infection is taking a turn for the worse include: Extreme tiredness or weaknessLow appetitePersistent coughWheezingShortness of breathBluish skin, lips or nailsSudden change in mental state Another clue is if your temperature continues to climb, Schaffner says, or if your cough starts to produce sputum (phlegm or mucus), which could indicate that “you’ve developed a complicating pneumonia.” If you notice any of these more serious symptoms, seek medical attention. Treating RSV symptoms Both flu and COVID-19 have prescription antiviral treatments that can help keep a mild infection from turning severe, but no such treatment exists for RSV, which is why Schaffer says prevention with the vaccine is crucial. If you have a mild infection, you can get relief from symptoms with over-the-counter medications. Ann Philbrick, a pharmacist and associate professor and director of community engagement in the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy, suggests a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to curb any aches and pains from the illness, though it’s always important to check with a doctor or pharmacist first to see which type is best for your needs. For the cough, she recommends guaifenesin (Mucinex) to help “loosen up the mucus.” Guaifenesin can appear in combination products with dextromethorphan, a cough suppressant, but Philbrick generally recommends steering clear of the latter ingredient. “Because typically when we have an infection, a cough is good to loosen things up and get things flowing through the body,” she says. “Where I do recommend dextromethorphan is if that cough is just keeping you up at night and you absolutely cannot sleep.” Again, before using be sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist. Pseudoephedrine can help with congestion, but the medication can also affect blood pressure. “So for patients that have blood pressure issues already, that’s something that I would certainly limit or just kind of stay away from,” Philbrick says. And don’t forget fluids, she adds; staying hydrated is key.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/hiv-now-chronic-condition/,"'Exciting' Discoveries Could Finally Mean the End of AIDS HIV treatment, prevention have come a long way, and a cure is possible, researchers say By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments Published November 27, 2019 TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/AP Photo Barbara Lewis will never forget 1996. ""That was the year when people stopped dying,” says Lewis, a physician assistant and HIV specialist at Whitman-Walker Health in Washington, D.C. For the first 15 years of the AIDS epidemic, which began in 1981, researchers led by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were desperate to slow the progression of HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus. They tested high-dose medications such as zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (DDI) in clinical trials held in major urban areas where people were dying. Lewis, who worked at the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit at D.C.'s George Washington University for 10 years, says people diagnosed with HIV were desperate to get into the studies for a chance of survival. The drugs, which often came with severe side effects such as pancreatitis and pain from nerve damage, worked for some, but not all. Then, in 1995, a new class of antiretroviral drugs called protease inhibitors became available, and by 1996 AIDS was no longer the leading cause of death in young American adults. ""It was a game changer; ‘96 was the big turning point,” Lewis says. 'Breathtaking’ discoveries change the disease Some 23 years later, there still is no cure for the disease that has killed 32 million people around the world, according to most recent figures from UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. But since the mid-1990s, treatment for HIV with antiretroviral therapy has been “transformational,” says Anthony Fauci, an immunologist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), who has been on the front lines of the fight against AIDS since 1984. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) is a way for people who do not have HIV to protect themselves from acquiring the virus. The pill, when taken properly, reduces the risk of infection by about 99 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health experts are hopeful that such preventative therapies will help to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Yakubov Alim/Getty Images Today, one daily pill — often a combination of three drugs — can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, which allows a person with HIV to live a “relatively healthy, normal life,” Fauci explains. Suppressing the virus to undetectable levels also makes it “essentially impossible” to transmit HIV to a sexual partner. People at high risk for HIV can even prevent infection with a daily pill. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) is a way for people who do not have HIV to protect themselves from acquiring the virus. The pill, when taken properly, reduces the risk of infection by about 99 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health experts are hopeful that such preventative therapies will help to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Yakubov Alim/Getty Images ""We've changed this from a disease that was almost universally fatal years ago to a disease that now isn't really even a disease — you can just prevent people from getting sick if you treat them early enough,” Fauci says. ""The area of treatment has been breathtaking in the sense of its effectiveness,” he says. Breakthroughs notwithstanding, HIV/AIDS research has not slowed. Scientists are testing longer-lasting prevention and treatment therapies that would deliver virus-suppressing medication to patients every few months by injection or implant, “so that people don't have to be thinking about taking a single drug every single day of their life,” Fauci says. “It's fine-tuning, to make it much more user-friendly."" These longer-lasting drugs could be especially beneficial to younger HIV and at-risk patients who aren't used to taking daily pills, Whitman-Walker's Lewis says. Older adults with HIV, however, may already take daily medications to manage chronic conditions, “and if they're very used to taking a pill every day, taking an HIV pill is just no big deal,” she says. HIV vaccine trials are also underway, but “the big buzz now,” as Fauci puts it, is a national plan that would reduce new HIV infections by 90 percent in the next 10 years. “The way you do that is by aggressively going out, testing people, and those who are infected, treating them immediately” to prevent the spread of HIV, he explains. It also involves making preventative medications available to those at high risk of infection, including people who have an HIV-positive sexual partner or have multiple sexual partners. People who inject drugs or have sex with people who inject drugs are also considered high risk, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Cities such as San Francisco and New York, once epicenters of the AIDS epidemic, have “dramatically diminished” the number of new infections with this test-and-treat approach, Fauci says. Now, the public health community is “working fast and furious” to help other hard-hit cities, counties and states — including Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina — achieve similar results. Working toward a cure Viral suppression is one way experts are trying to end the AIDS epidemic. Others are working to eradicate the disease completely, by way of a cure. There are a number of reasons why a cure is needed, says Rowena Johnston, vice president and director of research at AMFAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. For instance, the emergence of drug resistance could make HIV “increasingly difficult to treat” in the future. There's also the cost of HIV care, which can exceed $379,000 (in 2010 dollars) in a person's lifetime, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Clearing an HIV infection would also clear someone of the stigma attached to the disease. Beliefs that HIV and AIDS only affect certain groups of people — such as drug users and gay men — are rooted in fear from images and misinformation that spread in the early days of the disease, the CDC says. “And as much progress as we've made in the last 40 years of HIV, there really is still a significant stigma attached,” Johnston says. Discovering a cure may seem like a lofty goal, but 2019 has been a “really exciting year” in terms of progress made, Johnston says. Researchers have been following a few cases in Europe where people living with HIV received bone marrow transplants to cure cancer. In both cases, the donor stem cells had a genetic mutation that blocks the HIV virus from entering the cells. Both patients were cured of their cancers, and HIV was wiped from their bodies. These findings are “truly pivotal,” Johnston says. “For the first time, we knew it was actually possible to cure HIV. There is a scientific basis for believing that a cure is possible, and we have one route by which that can be achieved.” Timothy Brown, also known as “the Berlin patient,” no longer has HIV. The virus was wiped from Brown’s body when he received a complete bone marrow transplant to treat his myeloid leukemia. The donor tissue had a CCR5 mutation, making Brown’s new cells impervious to HIV. Researchers point to Brown’s case, which was reported in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, as evidence that HIV/AIDS could be curable. AP Photo/Manuel Valdes However, performing costly and complicated bone marrow transplants on people infected with HIV is not a realistic way to cure populations around the world. Rather, the findings from these cases point to “promising avenues” that can be adapted in a clinical setting, Johnston says. One of these avenues is gene therapy — an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent a disease by replacing disease-causing genes with healthy ones, according to the NIH. In the case of HIV, Johnston says researchers could potentially “snip out” part of the DNA that allows HIV to enter and infect cells, and replace that gene with the mutated version that blocks the virus. Then the edited cells are transplanted back into the patient. “And the good news is, there doesn't seem to be any deleterious effects of doing that,” she adds. Experiments with gene therapy have shown promising results in treating people with sickle cell anemia and cancer. Johnston predicts clinical trials testing the technique's effectiveness with HIV are “a couple of years away.” ""It's a question of optimizing technology that already does exist, so we're not making up things that don't yet exist,” she says. Since the AIDS epidemic hit the U.S. nearly four decades ago, finding ways to treat and cure HIV has been nothing but challenging. But 40 years from now, Johnston says, having a cure for the disease “doesn't seem unreasonable.” Timothy Brown, also known as “the Berlin patient,” no longer has HIV. The virus was wiped from Brown’s body when he received a complete bone marrow transplant to treat his myeloid leukemia. The donor tissue had a CCR5 mutation, making Brown’s new cells impervious to HIV.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/how-to-boost-gardening-health-benefits/,"8 Ways to Boost the Health Benefits of Gardening Getting dirty is good for you. Here’s how to get the most out of it Pauline St. Denis / Getty Images By Kim Painter, AARP En español Published March 20, 2023 Spring is finally here, and for gardeners who’ve been cooped up in chillier parts of the country, that means it’s time to get outside and get a little dirty — and maybe a little healthy, too. Gardening is good for you. Studies show it is real exercise, with benefits that may include everything from stronger hands to healthier hearts and longer lives. One Swedish study found lower rates of stroke, heart attack and early death among older gardeners, regardless of their other exercise habits. Gardening also can be a boon for the mind and a way to connect with other people. Want to make a healthy habit even healthier? Consider these eight ideas: 1. Pick up the pace … gradually Physical activity guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week. Gardeners can “easily meet” the goal for moderate activity, says Candice Shoemaker, a retired professor of horticulture at Kansas State University. Though a little weeding might not raise your heart rate much, anything that uses both the upper and lower body, such as digging, raking or pulling a hose can get you into the moderate activity zone, Shoemaker says. If you’ve had an inactive winter, “maybe do little bouts at a time to build up” endurance, suggests Christine Zellers, a health educator with the Rutgers Cooperative Extension of Cape May County, New Jersey. “Maybe walk back and forth a little bit, get your muscles warm, maybe even do some stretches,” she says. 2. Lift that bale … with care Government activity guidelines call for strength-building exercises at least a couple of times a week, and the heavy lifting involved in some gardening tasks can count, the guidelines say. Shoemaker says her research shows that even light gardening tasks, such as potting plants, can improve hand strength and finger dexterity in older adults, including those recovering from strokes. Gardeners need to know their own strength and act accordingly, Zellers says. When she works alone with heavy bags of mulch, she uses a bucket to carry manageable amounts to planting beds. If you do lift heavy bags, avoid bending over and lifting in a way that strains back muscles, she advises. Instead, she says, bend from your knees and make your stronger leg muscles do the work. If you do a lot of squatting in the garden, you can make those leg muscles, and all your lower body muscles, even stronger. But take care: Gardeners prone to sore knees might want to limit squatting and kneeling on hard ground by using a two-sided gardening stool with a padded seat that can double as a kneeler, Shoemaker suggests. 3. Be sun savvy It can be tempting to look at gardening as a chance to soak up some sun and boost your vitamin D production. Though some doctors have suggested a few brief periods of unprotected sun exposure each week for that reason, the American Academy of Dermatology says it’s better to get the bone-building vitamin from supplements and foods, such as salmon and fortified drinks. That’s because sun exposure increases the risk of skin cancer. You should apply sunscreen with a protection factor of at least 30 about half an hour before going out, says Alison Ehrlich, a dermatologist in Washington, D.C. Also sun-smart: a broad-brimmed hat, long sleeves and pants — which also will protect you from ticks and other insects, she notes, especially if you tuck the pants into high boots. Ideally, she says, you’d stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., when the rays are strongest. Or, she says, you can “strategically garden in different areas of your yard” that are shady at different times of day. 4. Glove up The gardener’s best defense against poison ivy, poison oak, rose thorns and various other hazards is a good pair of long, cuffed gloves, Ehrlich says. “People get poison ivy along their wrists and forearms because their shirt moves,” she says. She usually wears a leather pair in her own garden. In wet conditions, she says, you might want to top those with a waterproof pair. 5. Mask up The same kind of face masks used to prevent COVID-19 can reduce seasonal allergy symptoms by reducing the pollen and mold spores you breathe in, research suggests. Many allergy patients probably noticed a difference after they started masking against COVID, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The group recommends people with outdoor allergies wear masks when mowing lawns or gardening. Allergic gardeners should keep their gardening gloves, tools and shoes out of the house and shower when they go inside, the group says. Getting out of your clothes and into a shower will limit your exposure to any poison ivy oil stuck on your clothes or skin, Ehrlich says. 6. Grow with others — or for them Joining a gardening club or community garden can make gardening a more social experience and intensify the physical and mental health benefits, studies suggest. Shoemaker says her research has shown that even solo gardeners can reap social benefits — by sharing what they grow. That might mean taking extra produce to neighbors or something more, she says. One man she interviewed grew flowers that he supplied to his church. “He said, ‘I met so many new people at my church, because they wanted to talk to me about my flowers,’ ” she recalls. Zellers notes that just going outside to garden can open social doors. She says people stop and talk all the time when she’s out working in her beds﻿. Those kinds of encounters can connect neighbors who might not otherwise speak, she says. 7. Grow more food Flowers are lovely, but if your garden doesn’t include edibles, you are missing out on an inexpensive way to add healthy food to your diet, Zellers and Shoemaker say. “If you grow food, you’re more likely to eat that food,” Shoemaker says. Research shows older adults who garden eat more vegetables than those who don’t. If space is limited, start by growing a few herbs, Zellers suggests. Not sure what to grow or how to do it? Cooperative extension offices around the country are great sources for gardening tips, she says. 8. Stop and smell the roses (and listen to the birds) One of the greatest mental health benefits of gardening, Zellers says, is the opportunity to unplug from everything else and spend some mindful time with nature. Research backs that idea: A 2022 study found that just seeing or hearing birds outside is enough to boost mental well-being, even for people with depression. “When I’m gardening,” Zellers says, “I try to take a moment to notice like, wow, the sun’s out, it’s beautiful today, I feel it on my skin. … It feels nice to be aware of those surroundings.” ﻿ Tips for Growing Vegetables Get all the gardening tips you need to grow your own vegetables from a Longwood Gardens landscaper.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/one-way-masking/,"Does a Face Mask Work if You’re the Only Person Wearing One? Universal masking is best, but one-way masking still protects wearer from COVID-19 EMS-FORSTER-PRODUCTIONS / Getty Images By Rachel Nania, AARP En español Published April 26, 2022 People throughout the country are removing their masks after two years of on-again, off-again requirements in stores, in offices, and on planes and buses. But hand-in-hand with newly relaxed masking rules are new questions, including whether continuing to wear a mask will still help lower your risk for COVID-19, even if others around you forgo face coverings. The answer: It’s “absolutely safer to wear a mask, regardless if those around you are not wearing one,” says Brandon Brown, M.D., an associate professor in the Department of Social Medicine, Population and Public Health at University of California Riverside School of Medicine. That said, the level of safety and protection depends on the type of mask you wear and how you wear it, experts say. Aim for an N95 mask When it comes to keeping risks low in a mixed-mask environment, your best bet is to put on a well-fitted N95 mask or similar respirator (like a KN95) because these masks are designed to protect the person wearing it, explains M. Patricia Fabian, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health at the Boston University School of Public Health. “That means that even if you are in a crowded room with people who aren't wearing masks and the air is contaminated with virus particles, that mask is still going to be protecting the wearer from anything that they're breathing, because essentially it's a filter that's cleaning the air before it goes into their lungs,” Fabian says. The protection isn’t 100-percent, she emphasizes, but as the name suggests, it’s pretty close. “They're called N95 because they filter out about 95 percent of small particles. But a 95-percent reduction is a big reduction in exposure,” Fabian adds. Pointing to proof that one-way masking with an N95 works, infectious disease expert Carlos del Rio, M.D., says that when he is taking care of a patient with tuberculosis, for example, he doesn’t make the patient wear a mask, but he wears one. “And I have never been infected by tuberculosis by doing that,” says del Rio, professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine. There’s plenty of research to back up the effectiveness of masks, too, including a recent California-based study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that people who wore an N95-type mask in indoor public settings were 83 percent less likely to test positive for COVID-19 compared to those with no mask. ﻿ Focus on fit of face mask Fit is key, however. Even a high-quality mask doesn’t do much good if unfiltered air seeps in because it’s too loose. You want to make sure the mask completely covers your nose and mouth and that there are no gaps along the edges. To test your fit, breathe in. If the mask collapses slightly, “that tells you that there's a tight-enough seal around your face, and that essentially all the air that you're breathing in is going through the filter part of the mask and not coming in through the edges,” Fabian says. When you exhale, you shouldn’t see any condensation on your glasses. (You can use a cold spoon that’s been in the fridge for a few minutes to do this test if you don’t wear glasses.) “Because similarly, the air should just be coming out through the filter and not through gaps around your nose,” Fabian says. Don’t have an N95 mask? Check to see if your local pharmacy is distributing them for free under a federal program. (The CDC has a free-mask locator online; you can also call 800-232-0233.) A word of warning: Beware of counterfeit masks being sold online, UC Riverside’s Brown says. The CDC maintains a list of N95 masks approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, as well as examples of counterfeit versions. A surgical mask still offers some protection against the virus, albeit less, experts say. Knotting the loops and tucking in the sides (see here for an example) can improve its effectiveness, a CDC study shows. Cloth masks, while better than nothing, are not especially great at keeping out the highly transmissible omicron variant and its increasingly contagious sibling strains, BA.2 and BA.2.12.1., which now make up the majority of infections in the U.S. Other variables at play A few other factors influence how well one-way mask wearing works. A big one is time. The longer you’re around an infected person, the bigger your risk for contracting COVID-19, del Rio explains. Ventilation is another variable. A well-ventilated space — this could be as simple as opening windows and doors — reduces the concentration of airborne contaminants, including viruses. And while vaccines and boosters are most effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19, they, too, lower your risk of infection, federal data shows. As pandemic-era restrictions continue to ease, it’s important to think through your risks and feel comfortable in the decisions you make, while also respecting the decisions others make, Fabian says. “And know that you can do something for yourself, irrespective of what the rest of the world is doing — and that’s wearing a mask,” she adds. Rachel Nania writes about health care and health policy for AARP. Previously she was a reporter and editor for WTOP Radio in Washington, D.C. A recipient of a Gracie Award and a regional Edward R. Murrow Award, she also participated in a dementia fellowship with the National Press Foundation.​","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

The article explores whether wearing a face mask is effective in preventing COVID-19 transmission even if others around you are not wearing one. The key finding is that wearing a well-fitted N95 mask or similar respirator can still provide significant protection, filtering out around 95% of small particles, even in a mixed-mask environment. A novel insight is that one-way masking can be effective, as demonstrated by infectious disease expert Carlos del Rio, who wears a mask when treating patients with tuberculosis, but doesn't make them wear one, and has never been infected. The article also highlights the importance of proper mask fit and ventilation in reducing transmission risk.",4

Know the risks and complications associated with this popular vision-correction procedure By Linda Marsa AARP Comments En español Published April 24, 2019 ALAMY STOCK PHOTO Alejandro Lopez, 62, started wearing glasses when he was in his 20s in order to read the newspaper and see things in the distance, and never liked them. So in 2000, Lopez, who lives in Malverne, N.Y., opted for what was then a relatively new procedure: LASIK, laser surgery to correct vision problems. He distinctly remembers looking at the clock in the operating room before the surgery, and it was too blurry to read the numbers. When he opened his eyes afterward, the clock was suddenly crisp and clear. “It was amazing and so fast. In 10 minutes, my vision had completely changed,” he says. “I was driving and even went to work the next day.” His vision remains good nearly 20 years later. That's the promise of LASIK: After a quick, relatively painless procedure in an eye surgeon's office, you can ditch your eyeglasses and contact lenses. Since 1995, when the FDA approved the first lasers to correct vision, about 9.5 million Americans have opted for the surgery. Some people experience troubling side effects, however, including severe dry eye. Here are a few things to know about the procedure. What is LASIK? LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) is an FDA-approved procedure to treat all three conditions that normally require glasses: nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. Using an ultraviolet laser, surgeons reshape the curvature of the cornea, the transparent dome-like front covering of the eye that refracts light and accounts for about two-thirds of the eye's optical power. With nearsightedness (myopia), the cornea curves too sharply, which focuses light in the front of the retina and blurs distances. Conversely, with farsightedness (hyperopia), when the cornea is too flat, light focuses behind the retina, blurring near vision. With astigmatism, the cornea can be too curved or too flat, which can cloud both close up and distant objects. First, a surgeon will flatten the eye, then cut a flap in the cornea, peeling it back to reveal the section underneath, which is called the stroma. Pulses from the laser destroy part of the stroma, at which point the flap is replaced. The laser is used to reshape the patient's cornea for sharper sight, depending on what needs to be corrected. The procedure itself usually takes only 30 minutes or less, and while patients can't drive themselves home, they often can recover enough to drive within a day or two. It may take a few weeks or months before the eyes heal and vision clears, however. Because it is an elective procedure, it's not usually covered by insurance and costs average about $4,200. For expert tips to help feel your best, get AARP’s monthly Health newsletter. What are the risks? While a 2009 FDA study found that 95 percent of patients were happy with the surgery, a small number, less than 1 percent, had problematic symptoms. Those can include seeing starbursts, glare or permanent halos, and dry eyes, night blindness or worsened vision. ""The risks are low but they're not zero,” says Anat Galor, an ophthalmologist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami Health System. “Anytime you do a surgery, you are damaging nerves. For whatever reason, some people have a propensity to develop chronic pain because their nerves become too sensitive."" One regretful LASIK patient is Paula Cofer, 60, a former banker in Tampa, Fla. She was becoming resistant to her contact lenses and after a long day at work, she found herself constantly putting drops in her eyes. Her sister experienced positive results with LASIK, so Cofer thought the surgery would help. Instead, her eyes became even drier, resulting in constant burning. She also had floaters that made it hard to see at all, especially at night, and her corneas became inflamed from scarring. “It's been a nightmare,” she says. “My vision has gotten worse and no part of my life has been unaffected by what the surgery did to me.” Cofer runs a website for people who have been harmed by LASIK that she says now includes 6,000 people who've had adverse outcomes. But the technology used in the procedure has improved, says Eric Donnenfeld, a New York- and Connecticut-based eye surgeon who reports having performed thousands of LASIK procedures. “The LASIK of today is much safer and more accurate than LASIK of 20 or even 10 years ago."" Who's most at risk for complications Some people are poor candidates for this surgery. They include those who suffer from diseases that affect wound healing, such as autoimmune disorders like diabetes, or those with a history of glaucoma, eye injuries or previous eye surgeries, along with thin corneas, large pupils (which make them more susceptible to glare, halos and starbursts and inhibits night vision) ordry eyes, which tend to be exacerbated by LASIK. And people older than around 55 may not be great candidates for LASIK in general, some say, because aging eyes are changing — or “unstable” in eye doctor parlance: Their corneas become stiffer, and they may be developing cataracts and presbyopia (the nearsightedness that comes with age). ""You're doing surgery on a moving target. Two years from now, what we did today may be no longer be good for your eyes,” says Galor of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. “This diminishes the ability of LASIK to make you independent of glasses."" LASIK surgeons now do preoperative evaluations to identify who might have problems, including dry eyes. “We now have two good treatments for dry eyes, so we'll pretreat patients to prevent complications later on,” says eye surgeon Donnenfeld, who estimates that he excludes about one-third of patients because they're not good candidates for LASIK.","The article explores the central theme of whether or not to undergo LASIK surgery, a popular vision-correction procedure. Key findings indicate that while LASIK can be effective, with 95% of patients reporting satisfaction, some individuals may experience severe side effects, such as dry eye, halos, or worsened vision. A novel insight is that advancements in technology have improved the safety and accuracy of LASIK, and preoperative evaluations can help identify patients at risk for complications, allowing for pretreatment to prevent issues.",5
https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2023/foods-you-can-eat-without-gaining-weight.html,"25 Foods You Can Eat Without Gaining Weight These healthy, delicious options are light on calories and fat, plus they fill you up By Stephanie Watson, AARP Comments Published December 19, 2024 Sam Island Cutting is critical when you’re trying to lose weight. You cut calories. You cut fat. Basically, anything that’s crammed with carbs, sweetened with sugar or dipped in a deep fryer is suddenly off-limits. But dieting doesn’t have to require deprivation. Many delicious (and healthy) foods can still be part of your dining repertoire. When it comes to diet, the aim is not “How low can you go?” Your body needs calories for energy. Try to focus less on the numbers and more on the overall quality of your diet. “Lean into whole foods and away from processed foods as much as you can,” suggests Katie Sanger, an integrative and functional registered dietitian in Boulder, Colorado. If you are going to indulge, the one food group that you can eat lots of without suffering the consequences of weight gain are non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, celery, zucchini and bell pepper, says Lona Sandon, a clinical nutrition expert at UT Southwestern Medical Center. “Non-starchy vegetables are the best ones to over-consume, because they’re so much lower in calories than other food choices,” she says. Even with vegetables, resist the temptation to go hog wild on any one food. Eat nothing but carrots, and you’ll have an overabundance of beta-carotene at the expense of other nutrients (your skin might even turn orange). Variety is the secret spice to any weight-loss diet. “When we focus on just one food, we are getting very minimal nutrients,” Sanger says. “Everything in moderation.” When making changes to your diet, you don’t need to go it alone. It’s preferable to get some help from your primary care doctor or a dietitian. Your doctor can check your vitamin and cholesterol levels to make sure you safely embark on your new way of eating. A dietitian can assess your needs and create a meal plan that’s not only tailored to your goals but also sustainable over the long term. Mix and match these 25 foods to your heart’s content as part of an overall well-balanced diet. 1. Berries Make berries your go-to cereal topper or dessert and start reaping the myriad health benefits. Pick any type of berry — strawberries, blackberries, raspberries or blueberries. All are low in calories and rich in nutrients like fiber, vitamin C, folate and potassium. The natural plant pigments that give these fruits their vibrant colors have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that might protect against heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Blueberries are rich in a flavonoid called anthocyanin that can help boost the immune system. Unlike other fruits, berries are relatively low in sugar. “You want to be mindful of how much sugar you’re consuming, even if it is from fruit,” Sanger says. Berries are low on the glycemic index, so they won’t spike your blood sugar, and you’ll digest them slowly. That’s important when weight loss is the goal. 2. Chickpeas Chickpeas, also called garbanzo beans, are a member of the legume family (which also includes beans, peas and lentils). You’re most likely to find them in hummus, a Middle Eastern spread made from mashed chickpeas blended with olive oil, tahini, lemon juice and spices. They also make an excellent salad topper. Some moderation is advised, because chickpeas are higher in calories (120 per ½ cup serving) and carbs (20 grams per serving) than many of the other foods listed here. Yet their nutrient-dense design still makes them a worthy addition to this list. “Chickpeas are very fiber-rich, and they’re a good source of protein,” Sanger says. The humble chickpea is also a good source of potassium, calcium and vitamin A, and research suggests they might help with weight management and heart disease prevention. To make your own, try this recipe for very green pea hummus. 3. Mushrooms The mushroom family is enjoying a renaissance. In 2022, The New York Times named this edible fungus “ingredient of the year.” It’s no wonder, since mushrooms make a lower-fat and lower-calorie stand-in for meat in recipes. “They don’t have the protein and the same level of B vitamins that meat has, but they have that chewy texture, which makes it easy to put them into a dish and reduce some of the meat,” says Sandon. Because of the way mushrooms grow in the ground, they absorb a lot of nutrients, which vary depending on the type — and there are a lot of varieties to choose from. Cremini and portabella mushrooms are high in selenium, while shiitake mushrooms are a good source of vitamin B6. ﻿4. Celery Don’t relegate celery to the veggie tray. This versatile vegetable is so much more than a cocktail party hors d’oeuvre. For a mere 6 calories per stalk, it offers fiber, plus nutrients like potassium, vitamin A and lutein, along with a satisfying crunch. Another benefit? Celery is 95 percent water, with nearly one half-cup in each serving. The combo of water plus fiber fills your belly quickly, which prevents you from overeating, Sanger says. If you find this simple veggie too plain on its own, add a thin layer of hummus (see chickpeas, above) or add flavor with some lemon juice or chives.﻿ Popcorn is packed with fiber and whole grains, but be sure to limit yourself to three cups. Sam Island 5. Popcorn If you’re looking for the perfect low-cal snack, you’ve found it. Each crunchy bite of popcorn is filled with fiber and whole grains. With a mere 30 calories per cup, you can chow down on large quantities with zero guilt. One big caveat is to be careful of how you prep your popcorn. Popping it in oil and drowning it in butter and salt will override the health benefits (a tub of movie theater buttered popcorn can contain more than 1,000 calories and 2,650 milligrams of sodium). Instead, air-pop it and drizzle on a little olive oil or avocado oil, with just a pinch of sea salt for flavoring, Sanger suggests. Try to limit yourself to three cups, which is still a hefty portion of popcorn. 6. Grapefruit You might remember the grapefruit diet, a fad favored by celebrities in the 1970s. Eat grapefruit with every meal and the weight will melt off — or so proponents claimed. While grapefruit isn’t a magical fat-burning food, adding it to your diet (in moderation) isn’t a bad idea if you’re trying to lose weight. Because this fruit is 88 percent water, it should fill you up faster, so you’ll eat less. Just don’t load it up with sugar to make it taste sweeter. One precaution is to make sure it doesn’t interact with your medications. “Grapefruit or grapefruit juice can interfere with some types of blood pressure medications and cholesterol-lowering medications,” Sandon says. Ask your doctor or pharmacist whether this fruit is safe to eat with your current meds Popcorn is packed with fiber and whole grains, but be sure to limit yourself to three cups. Sam Island 7. Spinach It’s hard to find a food healthier than spinach. For just 40 calories a cup, it offers protein, folate, vitamin A and more than 400 percent of your daily requirement of vitamin K — a nutrient that’s essential for blood clotting and bone strengthening. The high potassium and magnesium content can help regulate blood pressure, and the fiber fills you up. Plus, it can help keep your gastrointestinal tract moving smoothly to prevent constipation. If you’re not enamored with spinach, the flavor is easily hidden in smoothies and casseroles. 8. Cottage cheese The vitamin D and calcium in dairy foods are essential components of strong bones and teeth. One easy way to meet your recommended daily allowance of these nutrients is to incorporate a serving of cottage cheese into your meals and snacks. The 2 percent variety is low in calories (91 per 4-ounce serving) but packed with protein and nutrients like phosphorus and potassium. Cottage cheese is unique in that the type of protein it contains, casein, digests slowly to help curb appetite, Sandon says. 9. Cauliflower When it comes to cruciferous vegetables, broccoli might get more attention, but cauliflower also deserves an honorable mention. It’s versatile and mild flavored enough to serve as a low-calorie (just 27 per cup) substitute for rice, mashed potatoes and pizza crust, which makes it a darling of the low-carb crowd. Proving that vegetables don’t need to be green to be nutritious, cauliflower is loaded with fiber, folate and vitamins C and K. ﻿ Carrots are a good source of vitamins A and K, as well as potassium and fiber — all for just 25 calories per medium-sized carrot. Sam Island 10. Carrots Eye doctors are big fans of this root vegetable, and for good reason. Carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A, which is essential for sharp vision. But there’s much more to these orange veggies than meets the eye. They’re also a good source of vitamin K, as well as potassium and fiber, all for a mere 25 calories per medium-sized carrot. 11. Oatmeal One cup of oatmeal contains four grams of fiber, but it’s not just any fiber. Beta-glucan is soluble fiber. When it mixes with water, it thickens and fills your belly, which wards off the late-morning hungries. Another beta-glucan perk is its ability to lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. As with popcorn, the right preparation is key. “If you’re putting on a pat of butter, brown sugar and a splash of whipping cream, that definitely negates the benefit,” Sandon says. She recommends making your oatmeal with low-fat milk for extra calcium and protein. Then top it with fresh berries to add nutrients without piling on more calories. 12. Black beans We chose black beans to represent the bean category, but really any variety — kidney, navy, lima or pinto — will work. Because black beans are legumes, they’re higher in calories (115 per ½ cup) and carbs (20 grams) than non-starchy vegetables, but with 8 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein per serving, they’ll really fill you up. “Beans can actually be substituted for meat because of their protein,” Sandon says. And thanks to their soluble fiber, beans are also helpful for reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels. 13. Lettuce Buried under a mound of salad toppings as it often is, lettuce is easy to overlook. But this leafy green is worthy of your attention. You can chow down on two entire cups of lettuce and still consume less than 16 calories. Skip the iceberg, which is also light in nutrients. Romaine and watercress have a similarly low calorie count, but they’re rich in vitamins A and K, as well as potassium. Because drowning your salad in dressing will add back all the calories you were trying to avoid, sprinkle on some lemon juice or olive oil and vinegar instead. 14. Pomegranate This bright red fruit has been part of the human diet for thousands of years — the seeds are an important part of the Greek myth of Persephone — but only recently have scientists discovered its full health potential. Pomegranates contain plant-protecting chemicals called polyphenols that also protect humans. These fruits have antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties, and they’re an excellent source of folate, potassium and vitamin K. Reaching the sweet and tart seeds can take some effort, but that’s a plus considering that an entire medium-sized pomegranate contains 234 calories. You’ll conserve calories if you save half for later. Broccoli is less than 30 calories per cup, so you can eat as much of this veggie as you'd like. Sam Island 15. Broccoli We’ve already established that the cruciferous vegetable family is filled with nutritional superstars, and broccoli is no exception. Its benefits are too numerous to list here, but some of the highlights are antioxidants like vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, which may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The high fiber content promotes fullness and keeps your digestive system running smoothly, while the anti-inflammatory properties are a plus for your heart and blood vessels. With less than 30 calories per cup of broccoli, you could feast on this veggie to your heart’s content without gaining weight. However, overindulgence does have a downside. “If you try to sit down and eat two pounds of broccoli…there might be some unpleasant GI side effects,” Sandon says. 16. Salmon This fatty fish has more than earned its title of “superfood.” It has just about everything in the nutrient department — including protein, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, potassium and vitamin A — all for a slim 130 calories per 3-ounce serving. Salmon is perhaps most notable for its omega-3 fatty acids, healthy fats that protect vision and lower the risk for heart disease. You might have seen the debate about farm-raised or wild-caught salmon and wondered which one to buy. Although farm-raised salmon tends to have more omega-3s, it could expose you to higher levels of pollutants and other contaminants. For a delicious way to prepare it, try Al Roker's salmon rice bowl recipe. Carrots are a good source of vitamins A and K, as well as potassium and fiber — all for just 25 calories per medium-sized carrot. Sam Island Broccoli is less than 30 calories per cup, so you can eat as much of this veggie as you'd like. Sam Island 17. Orange It’s easy to understand the orange’s appeal. This sunshine fruit provides a full day’s worth of vitamin C, plus fiber and protective antioxidants — all for around 65 calories. The high fiber and water content make oranges surprisingly filling. Like most other fruits, oranges are much healthier served on a plate than in a glass. “Essentially with fruit juice the fiber is removed, so you’re just getting a cup of sugar with some nutrients in it,” Sanger says. In other words, orange juice isn’t the ideal drink option if weight loss is your goal. Choose the whole orange instead. 18. Tofu This meat alternative is no longer just for vegetarians. Omnivores are also jumping on the tofu bandwagon. You can’t get much more versatile than this soybean-based food, since it assumes the flavor of whatever marinade or sauce you soak it in. Tofu contains 10 grams of protein, without all the saturated fat and cholesterol of red meat. Like other soy products, it’s rich in plant-based chemicals called flavonoids, which help to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk for heart disease and certain cancers. All that, and a ¾ cup serving contains just 100 calories. 19. Kale Kale is another entry that’s earned its rightful place among the pantheon of “superfoods.” People in the eastern Mediterranean region first cultivated kale thousands of years ago, but only in the last decade has it become a culinary trend in the United States. Its impressive nutritional credentials (calcium, potassium, vitamins A, B6, C and K, and folate), low calorie count (less than 35 per cup), and peppery flavor make this cruciferous veggie a favorite of chefs and dietitians alike. And like spinach, kale is versatile enough to blend into smoothies, roast into snack chips, or wilt into soups and stews. One large hard-boiled egg has 78 calories, but with those calories you get 6 grams of protein, along with nutrients like calcium, B vitamins, iron, lutein, zeaxanthin, selenium and choline. Sam Island 20. Eggs The much-maligned egg has taken a beating in the nutritional ring, but public opinion seems to be turning in its favor. One large hard-boiled egg has 78 calories, but with those calories you get 6 grams of protein, along with nutrients like calcium, B vitamins, iron, lutein, zeaxanthin, selenium and choline. While much of the controversy has centered on the cholesterol content of the yolk, the dietitians we spoke with don’t suggest ditching this nutritional powerhouse. “We usually recommend eating the entire egg,” Sanger says. “The yolk is where most of the nutrients in an egg are concentrated.” To avoid adding extra fat and calories, serve your eggs hard boiled or poached or rather than scrambled with butter or fried, and definitely leave off the bacon. 21. Tomato The tomato’s rich red hue isn’t just for show. The color comes from a plant pigment called lycopene, which also infuses these fruits (yes, tomatoes are fruits) with protective antioxidants. Studies have linked tomatoes with a reduced risk for heart disease, and for cancers of the lung, prostate and stomach. One medium-sized tomato has plenty of fiber, vitamins C and K, potassium and folate, and eating the entire thing will add just 23 calories to your daily tally. While some fruits and vegetables are healthier when consumed raw, cooking tomatoes boosts their lycopene content. 22. Brown rice cakes Who says you can’t snack when you’re trying to lose weight? You can if you substitute brown rice cakes for your usual crackers or snack chips. At 34 calories and less than 1 gram of fat per rice cake, it’s a satisfying treat that won’t compromise your diet goals. Brown rice has a definite advantage over white rice because it hasn’t been stripped of the bran and germ, where most of the nutrients are concentrated. As a result, it’s higher in fiber, potassium, iron, magnesium and some B vitamins. Rice cakes can be a little plain on their own, so Sandon suggests pairing them with a piece of low-fat cheese or some nut butter, which will also add protein. 23. Skinless chicken breast Chicken is another good-for-you protein source, but which part of the bird you eat and how you prepare it matters. Skinless chicken breasts are the best choice, with just 140 calories, 3 grams of total fat and 1 gram of saturated fat per 3-ounce serving. The same portion size of dark meat from a thigh or drumstick contains 170 calories, 9 grams of total fat and 3 grams of saturated fat. Regardless of whether you choose dark or light meat, coating it in flour and deep frying it will dramatically increase the fat and calories. Grill, roast or bake your chicken instead, removing the skin and adding olive oil and seasonings like rosemary, garlic powder or smoked paprika to ramp up the flavor. 24. Greek yogurt Yogurt has a lot going for it. It’s an excellent source of bone-building calcium and vitamin D, as well as gut-friendly bacteria called probiotics. Ounce for ounce, the protein count is on par with meat. Greek yogurt has the edge over its American counterpart, with almost twice the protein (21 vs. 13 grams per cup), as well as less sugar and fewer carbs. Sanger recommends choosing unsweetened Greek yogurt and sweetening it yourself with fruit or a little bit of honey. 25. Cucumber Few foods are cooler than the cucumber. Though this crudité has just 8 calories per half-cup serving, it’s no lightweight. Cucumbers contain a decent amount of fiber, calcium, potassium and vitamins A and K. Because cucumbers are 96 percent water, tossing a few slices onto your salad or sandwich can also help you achieve your daily fluid goals, and keep you filled up. Can foods have ‘negative’ calories? Some fruits and veggies, notably celery, grapefruit and cucumber, have been touted as “negative-calorie foods.” The premise is that these foods are so low in calories that the very act of chewing and digesting them burns more calories than the foods contain. It might seem a logical assumption. After all, celery is mostly water, and a whole stalk contains around 6 calories. For a while, drinking celery juice on an empty stomach was all the rage with dieters. But what limited research exists on the subject has pretty much debunked the negative-calorie claim. Researchers tested out the negative-calorie hypothesis by feeding celery to humans, as well as to bearded dragon lizards, and in most cases, it was a bust. Bottom line: Celery certainly won’t make you gain weight, but it won’t take weight off, either. One large hard-boiled egg has 78 calories, but with those calories you get 6 grams of protein, along with nutrients like calcium, B vitamins, iron, lutein, zeaxanthin, selenium and choline.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/is-mushroom-coffee-healthy/,"Is Mushroom Coffee Good for You? Get the real scoop on the health claims of adding mushrooms to your morning brew By Maggie Aime, AARP Comments En español Published January 12, 2024 GETTY IMAGES Tales of the miraculous health benefits of mushroom coffee have sprouted and spread on social media like fungi after a rain. Claims include: immune system boosting, inflammation reduction, cognitive enhancement, liver wellness and antioxidant support. But, with its premium price tag, does mushroom coffee really deliver?And how does it compare to the classic favorite, regular coffee? What is mushroom coffee? Contrary to what the name suggests, mushroom coffee does not contain chunks of mushrooms floating in your morning mug. Instead, it’s usually a combination of regular coffee and ground mushrooms. To make mushroom coffee, medicinal mushrooms like lion’s mane, chaga, turkey tail, reishi and cordyceps are dried and extracted. The mushroom extracts are then blended into regular coffee grounds. The result is a nutty and smooth elixir that tastes like regular coffee with an earthy, nutty twist. And if you’re not into the brewing process, mushroom coffee comes in different forms. These include grounds, premade lattes, instant packets and even convenient pods. Possible benefits of mushroom coffee Mushrooms are rich in essential nutrients, says Mindy Haar, a registered dietitian and chair of interdisciplinary health sciences at the New York Institute of Technology. “They are sources of the B vitamins, potassium, selenium and copper,” she says. Some mushrooms also provide zinc and vitamin D and are good sources of fiber. A review of studies published in 2023 in the journal Molecules notes several benefits of medicinal mushrooms. According to the review, they have compounds that may help prevent cancer, manage diabetes, regulate the immune system, fight obesity and slow aging. Since mushroom coffee blends ground coffee beans with caffeine-free mushroom powder, it contains less caffeine than regular coffee. For instance, a cup of brewed coffee has 96 milligrams of caffeine. In contrast, Ryze mushroom coffee has around 48 mg of caffeine per cup. Four Sigmatic claims about 50 mg in one packet of its mushroom coffee. Reduced caffeine levels mean less jittery feelings, especially as we age, according to Matthew Landry, a registered dietitian nutritionist and assistant professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California Irvine. Additionally, caffeine acts as a diuretic. This means caffeine causes more frequent urination by eliminating water from the body. For older adults who may not drink enough water throughout the day, this can lead to dehydration, Landry says. In such cases, mushroom coffee’s lower caffeine content could be helpful. Unfortunately, the hype around mushroom coffee has outpaced the research. Studies on mushroom coffee’s benefits and side effects are limited, according to Landry, although there are a number of studies on the health effects of mushrooms. If you’re looking for the unique benefits of mushrooms, Haar recommends sticking to plain coffee and adding mushrooms to your diet. She suggests it’s more affordable to get mushrooms’ advantages by eating them in food form instead. It’s unclear whether the process used to create the extract from mushrooms preserves the health benefits. But there has been some promising research on mushrooms used in food. Here’s a look at some of the research on potential benefits of mushrooms: 1. Reduces stress Medicinal mushrooms have been found to have adaptogenic properties. Landry explains that adaptogens “help the body adapt to better respond to stressful situations.” Compounds in medicinal mushrooms can affect cortisol levels in the body, he says. Cortisol — the stress hormone — is released when the body is under stress. Mushrooms may help regulate cortisol production, which could reduce the body’s response to stress. Landry also notes the long history of mushrooms in Chinese medicine. 2. Improves memory A 2022 study looked at mushroom consumption in older adults in the United States. Researchers found that those who ate mushrooms more often scored higher on cognitive tests. These findings suggest that regular mushroom consumption may help protect brain function. Coffee containing lion’s mane mushroom extracts may help with mental sharpness and memory. A 2021 laboratory study suggests that lion’s mane may increase the production of nerve growth factor. This protein plays a key role in the growth of nerve cells. But more research is needed, particularly in human trials, to draw any definitive conclusions. A 2023 laboratory study that was partially funded by the Australian government’s Boosting Dementia Research Initiative found that mice’s memory improved significantly when they ate lion’s mane crude extracts and Hericene A — a compound found in lion’s mane. However, further investigation is needed, especially in clinical studies involving humans. 3. Boosts immune system Laboratory research from 2019 examined substances extracted from turkey tail mushrooms. The research, sponsored by a company that grows and sells mushrooms commercially, noted the mushrooms may activate the body’s immune system defense and reduce swelling. Yet again, larger studies in humans are needed before final conclusions can be drawn. According to a 2018 laboratory study, the extract of Ganoderma lucidum — often referred to as reishi — was found to stop tumor growth and boost the immune system when given to mice with liver cancer. The study identified four pathways related to cancer treatment and immune response, and Ganoderma lucidum extract seemed to work through these pathways to suppress tumor growth and improve the immune system’s ability to fight cancer. But once again, a similar study needs to be done in humans before conclusions can be drawn about anti-cancer properties of reishi in people. 4. Helps heart health Some medicinal mushrooms show promise for improving heart health. For example, research﻿ from 2022 indicates that cordyceps may help manage irregular heartbeat. Side effects of mushroom coffee Because research on mushroom coffee’s side effects and benefits is limited, key questions about safe intake amounts and contraindications are left unanswered. “We do know there might be concerns with some medications that older adults take, especially for Alzheimer’s and osteoporosis,” Landry says. Maggie Berghoff, a functional medicine nurse practitioner in Westfield, Indiana, and author of Eat to Treat, notes that some mushrooms may thin the blood. If you’re taking anticoagulants, like warfarin or aspirin, check with your health care provider before drinking mushroom coffee. According to Berghoff, mushroom coffee likely boosts immune function. People taking drugs that weaken their immune system — immunosuppressants — should not consume mushroom coffee. She adds that coffee may increase blood pressure. Those taking medications to lower their blood pressure should discuss mushroom coffee with their health care provider. Haar points out that mushroom coffee contains high levels of oxalates. Oxalates are compounds found naturally in plants. Too much oxalate can cause problems for people with kidney issues. Anyone with kidney problems should avoid mushroom coffee, she says. Some people may have sensitivities or digestive issues that make mushroom coffee unsuitable, says Haar. Additionally, mushroom coffee products may use a variety of mushrooms. This means you may develop different reactions or side effects depending on the blend. Does mushroom coffee really deliver? Haar says if you’re enjoying a daily cup of mushroom coffee, there’s probably no harm in it, and it may offer some benefit. But to be sure to get the health benefits of mushrooms, stick to coffee if you drink it and work different types of mushrooms into your diet. Haar also says that the process of extracting mushrooms to make mushroom coffee removes the fiber, so you may miss out on the high fiber content you get from eating whole-food mushrooms. There’s also a chance the helpful nutrients in mushrooms may be reduced during the extraction process. With its reduced caffeine content per cup, mushroom coffee may seem like an attractive choice if your goal is to cut back on caffeine. But Haar says to consider this: One cup of regular coffee contains around 100 mg of caffeine. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends capping daily caffeine intake at 400 mg, recent studies propose that 100 mg to 200 mg could be beneficial. This is roughly equal to one or two cups per day. To moderate your caffeine intake, Haar suggests consuming two cups of regular coffee per day. Any extra cups you want after that should be decaffeinated coffee instead, she says. Landry points out the challenge of figuring out whether the effects seen in mushroom coffee come from the coffee or the added mushroom powder. Moderate coffee consumption alone is connected to some health benefits. These include decreased inflammation, improved heart health and better brain function. Landry suggests that mushroom coffee may provide comparable or even enhanced benefits — but there are not enough human studies on mushroom coffee to demonstrate that. Want to try mushroom coffee? Here are 8 things to consider: 1. Start by discussing your interest in trying mushroom coffee with your health care provider to make sure it’s safe for you. 2. Don’t assume all mushroom coffee products are made the same. “Do your due diligence and research to ensure the product you’re drinking is not just because you saw some influencer online talking about it or it was on the shelf at your grocery store,” Berghoff says. 3. Berghoff recommends opting for certified organic and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) coffee beans and mushroom components whenever possible to help ensure safe, high-quality ingredients. 4. Choose coffee brands that use a “dual extraction” method. This process extracts the most health-promoting substances from the mushrooms, Berghoff says. Additionally, look for “third-party testing” for quality verification, she says. 5. Pay close attention to the ingredient list. “You do not want any ‘artificial flavors’ on the ingredient label,” Berghoff warns. 6. If you’re trying to manage caffeine intake, check the caffeine content per cup, as it can vary widely between brands, Haar says. 7. Consider costs versus benefits. Landry suggests that whole mushrooms might offer better value. 8. Research where the mushroom is grown, Landry adds, because mushrooms readily absorb heavy metals and soil contaminants. Brands committed to safety will test for these substances, ensuring purity in their products.

Her work has been featured in GoodRx Health, Next Avenue, Insider and Health﻿News.","The article explores the health benefits and drawbacks of mushroom coffee, a trendy beverage that combines regular coffee with extracts of medicinal mushrooms.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/why-sleep-matters-more-for-women/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series Why Missing Sleep Is Worse for Women Than Men Not only do females get less sleep than males, their health suffers more from it By Michael Schroeder, AARP Comments En español Published December 22, 2023 greg801 / Getty Images Although roughly one-third of all adults don’t get as much sleep as they should, women seem to suffer disproportionately from not getting enough zzz’s. A new study in Diabetes Care finds chronic insufficient sleep —﻿ even getting about six hours of sleep instead of the seven to nine recommended — increases insulin resistance, raising risk for diabetes in otherwise healthy women. This adds to past research that finds women are more likely than men to not get the recommended amount of shuteye, increasing their risk for everything from heart disease to depression. To make matters worse, sleep deprivation and the negative health effects from it can be even more pronounced for women who’ve gone through menopause, researchers found in the Diabetes Care study and previous research published in the journal Hypertension. That study found that pushing back bedtime by an hour and a half, while waking up at the same time﻿, led to an increase in blood pressure. Again, the effect was more pronounced for those who had gone through menopause. In general, irrespective of age and other factors, “women tend to report poorer sleep quality overall,” says Marie-Pierre St-Onge, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep & Circadian Research in the Columbia Irving Medical Center. St-Onge, who was a coauthor on the Diabetes Care and Hypertension studies, explains that hormonal changes, like those women experience during menopause, can further disrupt sleep.﻿ But that’s only one piece of a complex puzzle. Experts still don’t know all the answers for why women have a more fitful relationship with sleep than men – who﻿, to be sure, also have significant issues getting the rest they need. One thing is certain: ﻿Sleep quality declines with age for both sexes. Understanding women’s sleep struggles Getting to the root of your unrested development, or an emerging sleep problem, isn’t so easy. But experts say understanding, at least in part, what’s contributing to sleep loss is critical to adequately address the problem before it gets worse and torpedoes your health. “Whenever we don’t sleep well, it literally makes every other component of our life and health worse,” says Marjorie Soltis, M﻿.D﻿., a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist at Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina. “It makes pain worse, it makes anxiety worse, it makes depression worse,” she says, to name a few examples. Soltis adds that sleep deprivation causes medical conditions to progress more rapidly as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that insufficient sleep contributes to or worsens mental health issues, brain disorders and chronic diseases. Research finds women are more likely to experience insomnia, and the CDC reports that 17 percent of women have trouble falling asleep most nights﻿, if not every night (when surveyed about the last 30 days), compared with almost 12 percent of men. “There are so many different reasons, I think, why women tend to be more sleep-deprived than men,” Soltis says. “A lot of that can relate directly to the hormones that are involved in making us female, allowing us to have children – and, of course, having children and caring for children also definitely impacts the degree of sleep deprivation that women experience.” Frequently﻿, sleep loss continues into later life as well, Soltis says, as women continue to take on a disproportionate share of family caregiving. Women are also slightly more likely to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety, which can contribute to insomnia and insufficient sleep, she adds. Women commonly experience sleep problems during perimenopause and﻿ menopause when hormone levels become irregular and symptoms such as hot flashes, which tend to be worse at night, and night sweats﻿ make it especially difficult to get a good night’s rest. The relationship between sleep and mental health is complex﻿, and the effect of one on the other goes both ways, complicating diagnosis. So in the space of a quick visit with a primary care doctor﻿, sleep-related problems can easily be overlooked. More pointedly, when “women seek care for various conditions, it may be written off as anxiety or depression when it may not actually be the case,” Soltis says. In cases where those issues are actually present, an underlying sleep problem that’s contributing could also be missed. Getting to the root cause of restless nights The first step to getting a better night’s rest involves taking sleep concerns seriously. As common as short sleep might be, experts say women and men often don’t think of it as a health issue at all. But a problem like sleep apnea — a common and potentially dangerous sleep disorder where a person’s breathing stops and starts many times overnight — can have dire cardiovascular consequences, causing heart rate and blood pressure to elevate. Although it’s most common in overweight men, sleep specialists emphasize that the disorder affects women, too, and people of all sizes and shapes. For persistent sleep issues, it’s important to see a health professional who can help. “Starting with a primary care physician [PCP] is good, but I don’t want patients to jump [right] to medications,” says Safia Khan, M.D., a sleep medicine specialist and program director of the ﻿Sleep ﻿Medicine ﻿Fellowship Program at UT Southwestern in Dallas, who coedited A Clinical Casebook of Sleep Disorders in Women. “If that’s what their PCP is offering, th﻿en they should request referral to a sleep specialist.” Khan﻿ says PCPs are perfectly capable of assessing patients’ sleep problems. The issue is typically one of time: ﻿If a patient has multiple conditions they’re seeing the doctor for, it’s unlikely the doctor is going to have enough time to dig deep into evaluating why they can’t sleep. Khan suggests that patients schedule an appointment specifically to see their doctor about sleep issues – so there’s time to do more than prescribe a sleep aid﻿, and they can deeply evaluate the causes of sleep woes. Solutions to help women sleep better Treatments for sleep problems are as varied as the issues, or disorders, themselves. But for specific symptoms related to menopause or hormonal changes, some women turn to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). “There have been studies showing improvement with sleep and other vasomotor symptoms (like night sweats) with hormone replacement therapy,” Soltis says. “That being said, some studies have shown hormone replacement therapy to be associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, certain cancers and blood clots.” Ultimately, Soltis﻿ says, the decision to pursue HRT has to be made on an individual basis with your doctor. When having that conversation, it’s important to assess the potential risks﻿ versus benefits of HRT, which﻿, she notes,﻿ may vary based on age, duration of treatment and other medical conditions. If hot flashes are disturbing your sleep, there are some strategies that help, such as limiting alcohol, caffeine and spicy foods. Also, the FDA approved a new pill this year, Veozah, to treat hot flashes, so talk to your doctor about whether this new medication may help. ﻿ For more intractable and deeper cultural or societal issues, such as women often taking on a greater share of caregiving, experts say help from others﻿ — family, friends, medical professionals and support groups — is key. Sharing caregiving responsibilities is critical to support the health and sleep of caregivers as well as those they’re supporting.﻿ Soltis stresses that every situation is different and needs to be approached accordingly. For example, for more complicated situations, such as a spouse with dementia or other serious health concerns, part of the solution could involve having outside caregivers come into the home to take shifts overnight, she says, so the partner can get much-needed rest. How to choose a sleep specialist If you are thinking about seeing a specialist﻿, just know that there’s no cookie﻿-cutter sleep doctor. Rather: With sleep medicine, physicians may come from all different backgrounds, Soltis says. A sleep medicine provider could be a neurologist, like Soltis, or a pulmonologist, anesthesiologist, family doctor or have a background in behavioral health, psychology or psychiatry. If a person has chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) or other significant breathing issues that affect sleep, a pulmonologist may be a good fit. If you are having abnormal behaviors like kicking, punching or acting out dreams at night, or have an issue that you think might be restless leg syndrome or narcolepsy? Maybe a neurologist is a good choice. Long﻿standing history of anxiety or depression that’s hard to control? A sleep psychiatrist might be the right professional for you. Sara Nowakowski, an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who has studied the impact of sleep issues on women’s health and a licensed clinical psychologist board﻿-certified in behavioral sleep medicine, says many people aren’t even aware that sleep professionals like her exist. She helps people make behavior changes, like recommending that patients get out of bed when they can’t sleep and creating a sleep schedule – and employs cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Nowakowski notes that around half – or more – of all postmenopausal women report sleep issues. “But it doesn’t mean it has to be that way,” she says. Getting help can turn sleep troubles around. But if you’re still not sure where to start, besides a recommendation from your primary care doctor, Soltis points out that many doctors have online bios detailing their areas of interest and conditions they see frequently. Improving your sleep hygiene Even the most inspired sleuthing to get to the root cause of your sleep woes with help from a professional can’t overcome bad sleep habits. You still have to prioritize getting rest. That includes making time for sleep – but not too much. Don’t sleep less than six hours or more than 10. If you can’t fall asleep, do your best to not stress or worry about it, which could make the problem get worse. Get out of bed, do something calming like reading, then go back to bed when your eyes get heavy. Also, ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep by keeping it cool and dark. Dim lights before bedtime – and give your smartphone the side-eye. “Phones are a huge distraction,” Khan reminds. Get an old-fashioned alarm clock if it’s disrupting your sleep and you’re scrolling your feed every time you should be dozing off. She says she often asks her patients about their screen time. She recommends starting your cellphone diet by breaking away from that screen during the day and doing more physical activity. Both time away from the cellphone and being more active during the day can help you ease into a more restful night. Because ultimately what happens in the middle of the night will follow you around for the rest of the day – if not the rest your life. “Disrupted sleep affects us in a lot of different ways﻿, and affects a lot of different body systems,” Soltis says, reiterating just how important it is for overall health.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/reasons-to-wear-sunglasses/,"7 Surprising Reasons to Wear Sunglasses These cool shades can protect you from headaches, wrinkles, even cancer By Elise Ceyral, AARP Comments En español Published April 25, 2025 Stocksy Just as it can damage your skin, the sun can do a number on your eyes. Among other things, ultraviolet (UV) rays can increase your chances of contracting debilitating conditions like cataracts and even cancer. “I can honestly tell when somebody was born and raised in Florida [and] when they weren’t,” says Kimberly Caracci, an optometrist at the Cleveland Clinic Florida. She explains that she can tell apart her patients who spent years in the Florida sun just by the damage it did to their eyes. Still, no need to stay inside to avoid the sun’s harmful rays. Sunglasses are an efficient — and stylish — way to protect your peepers, as long as they provide 100 percent UVA and UVB protection. Here are 7 good reasons to wear them: UVA and UVB The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) radiation that can be harmful to our skin and eyes. UVA and UVB stand for different wavelengths that pose different risks to our body — including skin aging for UVA and sunburn for UVB. Both can increase your risk for skin cancer. 1. Not protecting your eyes on a sunny day could lead to eyestrain and headaches. You may have experienced this on a particularly bright day. “If I don’t wear sunglasses, and you tell me to drive for an hour in sunny conditions, I will certainly have a headache,” says Alister Gibbons, M.D., an ophthalmologist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and an associate professor at the University of Miami. Squinting because of the light could fatigue your eyes, which might in turn lead to eyestrain and headaches. 2. You can get skin cancer on your eyelids, too. The skin on your eyelids is the thinnest on your body, but it’s hard to protect it against the sun’s harmful rays. Putting sunscreen on your eyelids can lead to irritation or styes, Caracci says, which makes sunglasses a must. Protecting your eyelids with sunglasses could also slow your skin’s aging process and limit the formation of wrinkles. 3. The sun can cause small growths on your eyes. These small bumps, called pingueculae and pterygia, grow on the conjunctiva, which covers the white part of your eyes. The more you expose your eyes to the sun, the more likely you are to get one of these bumps. Wind and dust are also believed to cause their formation. While a pinguecula may contain deposits of protein, fat or calcium, the American Academy of Ophthalmology explains, a pterygium (also known as surfer's eye) is a growth of fleshy tissue that may start as a pinguecula. “If [a pterygium] grows close enough to the center of the cornea, it will very much drop your vision,” says Peter J. McDonnell, M.D., director of the Wilmer Eye Institute and a professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. UVA and UVB The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) radiation that can be harmful to our skin and eyes. UVA and UVB stand for different wavelengths that pose different risks to our body — including skin aging for UVA and sunburn for UVB. Both can increase your risk for skin cancer. 4. Your eyes, too, can get sunburnt. This condition is called photokeratitis. “It’s actually very common […] to see people that went skiing without any sort of eye protection literally burning their corneas,” Gibbons says. That specific condition is referred to as snow blindness, but your eyes can also get sunburnt at the beach from the sun’s reflection on the sand and water. “Fortunately, it’s temporary, and it usually doesn’t leave any lasting damage. But it can be extremely painful,” Gibbons says. 5. Sun exposure over time can increase your risk of developing cataracts. Everyone would get cataracts — a condition in which the eye’s lens becomes cloudy — if they lived long enough, McDonnell explains. But spending too much time in the sun could lead to an earlier onset of the disease. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 10 percent of cataracts may be caused by overexposure to UV light and could be avoided. 6. You can get melanoma in your eyes. Skin isn’t the only area of your body where you can get a dangerous cancer called melanoma. The choroid — the layer located between the white of the eye and the retina — contains a lot of melanocytes, the cells that produce and contain melanin. “They can start multiplying and cause very aggressive cancers that can make you lose [not only] your eye, your vision, but even your life,” Gibbons says. Ocular melanoma can also appear in the iris or ciliary body — sometimes even on the conjunctiva. People with light skin and eyes, as well as those over 50, are at higher risk, but the condition remains very rare. Specialists still don't know exactly what causes eye melanoma, but sun exposure may contribute to the development of the disease. 7. Sunglasses are not bad for your health. Gibbons says the myth that sunglasses can be harmful might have originated at a time when sunglasses didn’t offer 100 percent UVA and UVB protection. “Patients [would] wear the sunglasses, and their pupils would become a little bigger because it was less light coming in,” he says. “So, if your pupils are a little bit bigger, but you’re not blocking the UV light, you will get more [harmful light] into your eye.” But this won’t be an issue with most sunglasses today, he says, because nearly all sunglasses offer UVA and UVB protection. A Guide to Sunglasses Opt for sunglasses that provide 100 percent UVA and UVB protection (also referred to as UV 400). “Any sunglasses sold in the U.S. should meet that norm,” Gibbons says. But when in doubt, you can take your sunglasses to an optician, who can use a photometer to inspect your lenses. Wear sunglasses (almost) every time you’re out. A cloudy day doesn’t mean a UV-free day. “You can get a sunburn on a cloudy day, and you can get UV light in your eyes,” McDonnell says. This is especially true for people who spend a lot of time outside, like hikers, sailors, skiers or golfers. Don’t forget your hat (and sunscreen). A hat with a brim will help protect areas not covered by the sunglasses. “One of my professors years ago showed that if you have sunglasses on that are 100 percent UV absorbing, [you’ll only] block 60 percent of the UV, because a lot will come from above and underneath, reflect off your nose and get into your eye,” McDonnell says. “When I watch my ophthalmologist friends, almost all of the time, they’re wearing their sunglasses and a hat with a brim.” Contact lenses are not enough. Some contacts will offer UV protection, but they will leave many parts of the eye defenseless against the sun’s harmful rays. “Anything in front of the cornea, the surface of the eye, the eyelids, etc ... are not being protected by the contact lens,” Gibbons says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/swearing-during-workout/#comments_widget_id,"Can Swearing During Exercise Improve Your Workout? Dropping a choice word or two during your next strength-training session may give you a boost By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published May 05, 2025 A profanity-laced workout may be just what you need for an extra edge. Jade Shulz It’s not often that your potty mouth is granted a pass, but that’s exactly what a growing body of research offers anyone looking to improve their workouts, including the millions of older adults who hit the gym regularly. Experts have known for a while that taboo words (and we aren’t talking dang or darn) have the power to help us release a range of emotions, both positive and negative. Turns out, that very quality comes in handy during certain types of exercise. In a landmark study published in 2018 in the journal Psychology of Sport and Exercise, a team of researchers — working off a hunch that dropping the F-bomb during exercise can improve power and strength — asked participants to choose a swear word they might use in response to accidentally banging their head﻿. They were then asked to repeat that swear word every three seconds during a 30-second, high-intensity cycling test that measures muscle strength and power﻿. Participants were also asked to repeat a swear word for 10 seconds before undergoing a test measuring grip strength and to continue repeating their swear word throughout the test. In both instances, researchers found that swearing improved performance: It increased peak and average power on the cycling test by 4.5 percent, on average, and grip strength by 8 percent, on average, compared to repeating a non-swear word. In a separate study, published in 2022, participants were asked to do chair push-ups, which involve using your hands to raise your body off a chair and holding the position for as long as possible. Those who repeated a swear word while doing so could hold the position for 10 percent longer than those who repeated a neutral word. WTF is going on? The power of profanity Experts aren’t entirely sure why four-letter words have such superpowers during a sweat session. What they do know is that “swearing might trigger a fight-or-flight response, increasing adrenaline and helping people push through physical discomfort,” says Greg Chertok, a certified mental performance consultant at Telos Sport Psychology Coaching. At the same time, the body typically has what’s known as an analgesic response, which increases your pain tolerance. “Swearing helps reduce pain perception, making exercise feel less painful, even when you’re pushing yourself to your limits,” Chertok explains. “There’s also research suggesting that swearing has psychological benefits, such as improving confidence, which could certainly be beneficial in a workout context.” Using expletives to improve physical performance has been shown to work only with moves that are relatively short and intense, Chertok says, meaning strength training exercises like lifting weights and power-building exercises such as kettlebell swings and squat jumps. The same isn’t true of cardio, he adds. ﻿ But that’s not to say there aren’t benefits to a little strategic swearing during your daily power walk, weekly spin class or run around the neighborhood. A study published in 2024 in the Journal of Exercise Physiology suggests that while swearing during intense cardio aerobic activity doesn’t impact endurance, it may make a bad mood a little better.﻿ What’s more, the study found that scores gauging mood and fatigue were worse with neutral words than with curse words. How to practice strategic swearing Swearing in the name of upping your workout isn’t the same as run-of-the-mill, anger-fueled spontaneous swearing directed at, say, the driver who abruptly switches lanes and causes you to swerve, missing another driver by this much. No, strategic swearing involves more control and, ahem, discipline. Where to begin? First off, pick a swear word. The most effective ones are personally meaningful and/or pack an emotional punch, says Nick Washmuth, a researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, who studies the beneficial effects and real-world usefulness of swearing. For most people, suggests a review of research published in 2024 in Frontiers in Psychology, that tends to be the F word or the S word. Whatever it is, you should use it as you would any piece of strength-training equipment: Unabashedly and at a steady clip. In other words, suggests Washmuth, swear out loud using normal speech volume — not whispering, not shouting﻿ — and repeat your chosen swear word just before the physically challenging move and then about once every one to five seconds during the move. As for the swearing averse, unfortunately, a robust dadgummit! fudge! or shoot! won’t get the job done. “Evidence suggests only actual swear words produce the desired psychophysiological effects,” Washmuth says. ﻿ Something else to keep in mind: You should use your self-designated swear word judiciously. Curse words are stripped of their superpower when used to excess, diminishing their emotional charge. ﻿ For those who avoid swearing, that’s good news. “If you rarely swear, you might actually experience a greater psychophysiological response when you do swear, leading to bigger performance benefits,” Washmuth says. “For strategic use, it may be wise to save swearing for special occasions — like tough workouts — to maximize its impact.” Adds Chertok: “The words we choose to use have a very real chemical effect.” For example, even though research suggests only actual swear words have the power to improve physical performance, Chertok believes “singular words like banana and vomit would induce microscopically different psychophysiological responses within us.” ﻿ Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Women’s Health, Prevention, Health and Reader's Digest.","The article explores the idea that swearing during exercise can improve physical performance, particularly in strength-training activities. Research has shown that using swear words during high-intensity exercises can increase power, strength, and endurance, possibly by triggering a fight-or-flight response and reducing pain perception. The key to ""strategic swearing"" is to choose a personally meaningful swear word, use it at a steady clip, and reserve it for challenging moments to maximize its impact. Notably, the benefits of swearing during exercise are most pronounced when used judiciously, as overuse can diminish its emotional charge.",10

The one you can stick with. Research shows you’re more likely to keep walking, running, swimming, cycling — or whatever activity you’ve placed at the center of your move-to-lose goal — if you enjoy doing it (or at least don’t dread it). But keep in mind: Exercise, even when it’s an activity you enjoy, is only part of the losing equation. “One of the things we see in the research is that a combination of diet and exercise is the most successful for long-term weight loss,” says Anthony Wall, an exercise physiologist and certified ACE (American Council on Exercise) personal trainer. “You can train really hard, but if your nutrition isn’t where it should be, then you’re going to find you have challenges losing weight.” Staying Fit Discover more workout routines at AARP's Staying Fit.

Walking 150. That’s the number of minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends for adults. Brisk walking is arguably the best way to check that box. It requires no special skill, no special equipment (unless you consider comfortable sneakers special or, for that matter, equipment) and it adapts to virtually any schedule, any climate, any fitness level, any age. Walking does it all -- you lose body fat and gain muscle mass. In a study published in 2022 in Nutrients, post-menopausal women lost body fat with walking, either fast or slow. ﻿ VIDEO: Fat-Burning Indoor Walking Workout With Denise Austin 2. Strength training It almost seems unfair: Your current weight loss efforts are influenced by a physiological change that kicked in decades ago. Around age 30, your muscle mass began to decrease and has continued its decline ever since. In fact, research suggests we all lose around 3 to 8 percent of lean muscle mass per decade; the rate of decline picks up after age 60. Why does that matter? Besides contributing to an increased risk of falls, that dwindling muscle mass impacts the way you burn calories. “As we age, our muscle mass naturally decreases,” says Sabrena Jo, Ph.D., ACE Senior Director of Science and Research. “Because muscle tissue is more metabolically active — meaning it burns more calories — than fat tissue, the loss of muscle mass reduces the body’s resting metabolic rate, meaning fewer calories are burned at rest. In part, this makes weight loss more challenging for those over 50.” Challenging, but far from impossible. In fact, a large review of studies published in 2023 in Advances in Nutrition found that the most effective weight loss strategy for overweight or obese people ages 55 to 70 involved strength training, in addition to calorie cutting.

Aim for two to three sessions per week, but “begin slowly and focus on form,” advises Jo, who suggests enlisting a certified exercise specialist to learn the basics, including proper technique. “Bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges and push-ups can be a great starting point. Resistance bands and light weights can be introduced gradually.” Another incentive, once you have an established routine, strength training can easily be done at home. 3. Swimming Among the culprits intent on sabotaging your exercise goals after 50: arthritis and other conditions that can affect stamina, mobility and balance. That’s where swimming comes in. “Swimming is an excellent low-impact exercise, making it ideal for older adults, especially those with joint pain or arthritis,” says Jo. “It provides a full-body workout, improving cardiovascular health, flexibility and muscle strength. The buoyancy of water reduces the impact of gravity on the body, decreasing the risk of injury.” VIDEO: Denise Austin 10-Minute Cardio Core 4. Intervals All cardio — including walking, cycling, jogging — counts, but alternating short bursts of intense activity with lower-intensity moves has been shown to provide a greater boost to your metabolism than moderate-intensity exercise alone. One study of sedentary women compared 20 minutes of high intensity interval training (HIIT) with 40 minutes of low- to moderate-intensity exercise. The HIIT participants were the only ones who lost fat — primarily belly fat. “Interval training is a highly effective way to boost cardiorespiratory fitness and burn calories,” says Jo. “To embrace interval training, start with simple intervals, like brisk walking interspersed with periods of slower walking. Gradually increase the intensity and duration of the high-intensity phases as your fitness improves. It’s essential to listen to your body and avoid pushing too hard, especially if you’re new to interval training.” 5. Cycling Whether it’s atop your own two-wheeler, a bike-sharing bike, or a stationary bike at the gym or at home, cycling can be good for weight loss. Like any aerobic activity, it depends on how often and how intense the workout. According to the CDC, biking 10 miles or less per hour on flat terrain is considered moderate intensity; faster than that counts as vigorous cardio. For a 154-pound person, a 30-minute ride burns around 145 calories. Try a cycling app to track those things on outdoor rides; a stationary bike will do that for you. Another benefit of indoor cycling: “It’s low impact,” says Wall. “Recumbent bikes are easy to get in and out of. For somebody who’s overweight or has reduced mobility — and may be uncomfortable with exercise — that’s very important.” VIDEO: Denise Austin 10-Minute Cardio Core 6. Tai chi This ancient Chinese exercise — made up of a series of movements that are meant to be performed slowly and purposefully — is known for improving balance and preventing falls. But weight loss? Surprisingly, yes. “Exercises like tai chi improve coordination and balance and can be incorporated into a weight loss plan,” says Makeba Edwards, an ACE certified personal trainer. It can also “stimulate muscle overload, which builds and strengthens muscles.” Like any strength-training exercise, that boosts metabolism. And it may help reduce belly fat in middle age, suggests a study published in Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers randomly assigned more than 500 adults over 50 with central obesity into one of three regimens: one hour of tai chi three times a week; a conventional regimen of brisk walking and light strength training; or no exercise at all. After three months, researchers found that the tai chi group had lost as much weight and as many inches around their waist as the walking/strength-training group. Interested in trying tai chi? Taking a class is a good way to make sure you’re doing the moves correctly. Inquire about classes at a local YMCA, adult community center, community college or hospital. 7. Yoga If you’ve been practicing yoga as a way to destress and reserving the gym to meet your weight-loss goals, you may want to rethink your strategy. Turns out, yoga offers its own weight loss bona fides. In a study published in 2021 in the journal Obesity, 50 overweight or obese adults were asked to practice yoga five times a week, while following a reduced-calorie diet and attending weekly group sessions on behavioral strategies — all in the name of losing weight. After six months, all participants not only lost a significant amount of weight, they also improved their cardiorespiratory fitness. Surprisingly, the study found that participants didn’t need to practice power yoga to get results. Even those who followed a restorative form (called hatha yoga) experienced weight loss —the same, in fact, as the group that practiced the more vigorous vinyasa yoga. 8. Pilates This low-impact exercise has long had a reputation for core-strengthening. But what role, if any, does it play in weight loss? In a review of 11 studies published in 2021 in Frontiers in Physiology, researchers looking at the effects of Pilates on body weight in overweight and obese adults found that practicing Pilates moves regularly led to a significant decrease in body weight, body mass index and overall body fat. Curious, but not sure where to begin? Pilates is often performed on a mat or in a chair and includes a number of moves found in other types of resistance training. It can be done at home with an exercise mat or reformer, but before you invest in gear, try a few classes at a Pilates studio with a certified instructor or at your local gym.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eye-drops-common-mistakes/,"7 Mistakes You May Be Making With Eye Drops Beware of these common errors that can lead to dangerous infections By Aaron Kassraie, Updated May 22, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published April 26, 2023 / Updated May 22, 2023 BananaStock / Getty Images As we age, our risk of developing eye conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts and dry eyes increases. As a result, our reliance on eye drops also spikes. Several eye drop brands, including EzriCare, Pharmedica and Apotex, have been recalled in recent months due to contamination concerns that pose the risk of blindness. Most recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a consumer safety warning about amniotic fluid eye drops on the market that were never approved for sale. The most concerning of the recalls are those linked to EzriCare eye drops, which have been contaminated with pseudomonas, a virulent bacteria that is resistant to many types of antibiotics, says Daniel La﻿roche, M.D., an ophthalmologist, director of glaucoma services and president of Advanced Eyecare of New York. “You have to have a combination of multiple classes of antibiotics to try and treat this,” he says. “It is very aggressive, unlike basic bacterial conjunctivitis that you can get away with coming in [for a doctor visit] a day or two late and it does respond to antibiotics.” In contrast, pseudomonas can cause a severe infection that can scar the cornea within hours, spread to the inside of the eye in as little as 24 hours, and then penetrate the blood vessels to cause a systemic bodily infection that can result in death. Four people have died because of infections from EzriCare drops. Even if you aren’t in danger from one of the recalled eye drops, using drops the wrong ways can be harmful to your eyes and increase your risk of infections. Nearly 1 million doctor visits are made each year in the United States for eye infections, including 58,000 emergency room visits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates.﻿ To use eye drops safely and effectively, La﻿roche highlights these mistakes to be avoided. 1. Using eye drops manufactured outside of the United States Eye drops made outside the United States may not meet the same safety standards as products made domestically, La﻿roche says. An FDA inspection of EzriCare’s manufacturing plant in India found a number of sanitary and quality assurance violations, including a “black, brown colored greasy deposit” on a bowl used to transfer bottles and “deficient” processing areas for cleaning and disinfecting the room. Before using a product, check with the FDA to find out if it﻿ is recalled or has a safety alert. Then, inspect the bottle’s packaging to make sure it has not been opened or tampered with and does not appear to be contaminated. 2. Not washing your hands before and after using eye drops Bacteria can be found on our hands and eyelashes, and can spread from there to our eyes. To reduce the bacterial count, wash your hands often with soap and water and use a warm washcloth to clean your eyelashes. 3. Allowing the dropper to touch your eye Touching your eyeball with the dropper may contaminate your eye or even the bottle and further the spread of bacteria. 4. Leaving the eye drop bottle open after use, or storing it in places with too much heat, light or moisture After use, close the eye drops tightly and store them in a clean, cool place. Do not store eye drops in direct sunlight or near a heat source, as this can degrade the active ingredients and make the drops less effective. 5. Sharing your eye drops with others If a bottle gets contaminated and then shared with other people, an infection can spread. Staff and residents of nursing homes and hospitals should be particularly conscious of the dangers of sharing eye drops because pseudomonas is more common in those settings. 6. Keeping the drops more than 30 days after opening them La﻿roche recommends throwing away all eye drops 30 days after opening because they may harbor bacteria, even if they are stored properly. In particular, preservative-free eye drops, such as those sold by EzriCare, are more likely to spoil. If you choose to use preservative-free eye drops, consider using one-time-use vials, which can be immediately discarded. 7. Not getting annual eye exams As we grow older, our eyes undergo changes, which is why it is important for those over age 50 to have an annual eye exam. During the exam, your doctor will assess your vision, look for indications of disease and confirm whether your glasses or contact lenses are still accurately prescribed.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/skin-tag/,"Guide to Better Skin View Series Brought to you by Skin Tags: What They Are and When You Should Remove Them How to safely rid yourself of these harmless growths if they irritate you By Stephanie Watson, Updated July 18, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published May 13, 2022 / Updated July 18, 2024 At some point, you might have lifted an arm or peered at your neck in the mirror and discovered a skin-colored growth that wasn’t there before. What you found was most likely a skin tag, given that about half of us will have at least one of these harmless protuberances over the course of our lifetime. The older we get, the more of them seem to pop up. Skin tags, or what your dermatologist calls acrochordons, are usually harmless and nothing to worry about. Yet there are some situations in which you’ll want to consult with your doctor, especially if you’re wondering whether to remove these growths. Read on for answers to some common questions about skin tags. What are skin tags? Skin tags are nothing more than outgrowths of regular skin attached to a thin stalk, or base. They’re usually the same color as the rest of your skin, although they can be slightly darker. Tetiana Mandziuk / Getty Images Most skin tags are a couple of millimeters across — less than the width of a pencil eraser — but they can grow larger. What causes them? Skin tags often form in areas where skin rubs against skin or fabric, says Sara Lamb, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at Virginia Commonwealth University﻿. So don’t be surprised if you see them in places like your armpits, under your breasts, in the creases of your thighs or on the part of your neck that regularly brushes against your shirt collar or a necklace. A Guide to Better Skin After 50 Have healthy looking skin at any age Tips, advice and resources Obesity slightly increases your risk for skin tags, possibly because of skin-on-skin friction. They’re also more common in people with type 2 diabetes, which probably has more to do with the weight connection than the disease, Lamb says. Skin tags can actually be a sign of early diabetes — one of the reasons you should pay attention to them. Scientists think insulin resistance may be linked to skin tag growth. Some families collect more of these growths than others. Scientists haven’t yet discovered a skin tag gene, but if a few of your close relatives have skin tags, genetically speaking they may be in your future, too. Why do we get more of them as we age? The reason ﻿might be that friction builds over the passing years, according to Lamb. Also with age comes a loss of skin elasticity. Sagging skin is more likely to rub than firm skin. Tetiana Mandziuk / Getty Images Are skin tags dangerous? The sight of any new skin growth can send your mind spinning straight to the big C, but skin tags aren’t cancer. In fact, they’re usually harmless. Can a skin tag turn into cancer? “Technically, yes, because it’s skin like any part of your body,” Lamb says. She’s seen one rare case of a basal cell skin cancer developing on a skin tag﻿. Still, it’s extremely rare for that to happen. The only real risk with a skin tag is that it might twist around on its stalk and cut off its own blood supply. Without blood, the skin tag will die, and it could become infected. Skin tags that get caught in a necklace, shirt collar or piece of your hair can also be painful. That’s often what prompts people to want them removed, says Susan Massick, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. How can you tell whether it’s something more serious? What looks like a skin tag to the untrained eye might actually be a mole, which could be cancerous. Don’t necessarily rely on your own detective work and assume that a growth is a skin tag. If you’re unsure, get it checked out, Massick suggests. See your doctor or a dermatologist. For more details, read 4 Warning Signs of Melanoma That Are Easy to Miss. When should you remove a skin tag? A skin tag that’s infected or inflamed should come off, Lamb says. Otherwise, you don’t need to remove it unless you don’t like the way it looks or it’s getting caught in your clothes or jewelry and irritating you. Keep in mind that if you do have a skin tag removed simply because of its appearance, your insurance company will likely consider the procedure cosmetic and won’t cover the cost. Can you remove skin tags yourself? Massick says it’s best to check with a doctor, but she has had some patients remove small skin tags themselves. You just need to be careful. FDA: Beware of Skin Tag and Mole Removal Products The FDA is cautioning ﻿consumers not to purchase skin tag and mole removers online. Learn more. First, make sure your scissors are sterile. The ones you find lying at the bottom of your junk drawer could cause an infection. Either boil them or clean them with rubbing alcohol. ﻿The scissors also need to be small enough to reach the skin tag’s base, and sharp. “If they’re dull, you’re not going to be able to cut through the skin,” Massick says. Clean the skin tag area as well. Prepare yourself for a bit of bleeding after you snip. Have some gauze ready to stop it. Another home-removal technique is to tie off the skin tag with a piece of string or dental floss. If you want to try this, make sure you tie the string tightly around the base of the skin tag close to your skin. That will cut off the skin tag’s blood supply. (﻿It shouldn’t be painful, Massick says. If it is, take the string off.)﻿ Leave the string in place. It can take a few days for a skin tag to die and fall off. How do dermatologists remove skin tags? For larger skin tags or any you’re unsure about, see your dermatologist, Massick says. Your doctor can cut, freeze or burn off the growth. They can also biopsy the removed tissue to make sure it’s benign (not cancerous). The method your doctor uses to remove skin tags will depend on their size. “If there are a lot of little ones, we can quickly freeze them like we freeze warts,” Lamb says. “If it’s bigger ones, we’ll snip them.” To freeze them off, also called cryosurgery, your doctor will spray liquid nitrogen onto each spot. The super-cold liquid creates little blisters. “As the blister falls off, the skin tag will fall off as well,” Massick says. The process takes time. Expect to wait anywhere from a few days to two weeks for the skin tag to fall off. Cauterization involves a similar process, but it uses heat to burn off skin tags. Another advantage to seeing a doctor is that it’s less painful than the do-it-yourself method. An injection of lidocaine numbs the area around larger skin tags, so you won’t feel anything during the procedure. Can skin tags come back after you remove them? A skin tag shouldn’t grow back after an in-office procedure, but don’t be surprised if you see a new one in the same area. “They tend to congregate in similar locations — skin folds, arms and neck, in between the thighs and under the breasts. So if you have one, you’ll probably get more as time goes on,” Massick says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/dementia-risk-factors/,"Two More Ways to Lower Your Risk for Dementia Now there are 14 actions to take to protect your brain, some easier than others By Kimberly Goad Reviewed by ​​Jason Hassenstab, Ph.D. Comments En español Published September 30, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Getty Images(4)) A renowned group of researchers has just handed us two more ways to reduce our risk for dementia. If we can take those actions, and chip away at a dozen other risk factors, a substantial number of dementia cases could be delayed or prevented. Those risk factors are associated with up to half of all dementia cases. ​When the group of doctors, epidemiologists and public health researchers collectively known as the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care first suggested in 2017 that you could cut your risk for dementia by altering some key lifestyle habits, it was unexpected. Could eating healthy, exercising more, going light on alcohol and amping up our social lives, plus a few other actions, really guard against cognitive decline? Surprisingly, yes. And the health care heavy hitters on the Lancet Commission have a mountain of research to back up their claims. “A lot of people … thought it was extremely radical,” says Gill Livingston, M.D., Lancet Commission lead, professor of psychiatry at University College London and a member of AARP’s Global Council on Brain Health. But the evidence has grown over the years, she says. The Lancet Commission’s latest report, released in July, now lists 14 modifiable risk factors, things you can actually do something about (although some risk factors are arguably beyond an individual’s control). The two new risk factors are untreated vision loss and high LDL cholesterol. “The data is pretty clear that managing a lot of these risk factors ﻿[in midlife﻿] can have a fairly significant impact on dementia risk later in life,” says Ian Grant, M.D., assistant professor of neurology at Northwestern University School of Medicine, who was not on the committee. “People with healthy lifestyles … were shown not only to have a lower risk of dementia than those with less healthy lifestyles but also to have dementia onset delayed … resulting in more healthy years and fewer years of illness,” the commission wrote. And for people with dementia, these lifestyle changes can “help maximize physical health and improve quality of life.” Here’s the list of 14 modifiable risk factors, along with what you can do about them. 1. Untreated vision loss. Get your annual eye exams.﻿ One of two new risk factors in the Lancet Commission’s 2024 report, untreated vision loss is arguably the most confounding. How can it lead to cognitive impairment? “Any kind of what we call primary sensory loss — like vision — is bad for the brain because the brain doesn’t like a lack of input,” Grant explains. “That stimulus into the brain is important for maintaining certain connections.” The Lancet Commission’s report found an increased risk for dementia associated with two common vision problems: cataracts, a clouding of the lens, and diabetic retinopathy, caused when excess sugar in the blood damages blood vessels in the back of the eye. When those problems are corrected, the risk drops dramatically. More than half of people with diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. 2. Hearing loss. Have your hearing checked and get hearing aids if needed. ﻿The Lancet Commission considers hearing loss the single biggest modifiable risk for dementia. Why? “Hearing loss may impact dementia risk by reducing overall neural stimulation and by reducing social interaction,” says Jessica Caldwell, director of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement Prevention and Research Center at Cleveland Clinic. “It’s also possible that hearing loss and dementia have a common cause, such as ﻿[changes in the small blood vessels of the brain﻿].” ﻿Less than a third of people 71 and older with hearing loss use hearing aids, according to a July 2023 JAMA study. Yet use of hearing aids appears to be particularly effective at protecting cognitive well-being, according to a July report from AARP’s Global Council on Brain Health. 3. Obesity. Maintain a healthy weight.﻿ Obesity ups your risk for dementia mostly because it’s linked to so many of the other risk factors, especially type 2 diabetes. How so? Like all cells, the nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain use glucose as their energy source. But they can’t take it up unless insulin is doing its job. Excess body weight (especially around the belly) makes it harder for insulin to essentially open the doors of the cells in your body, which then allows glucose to leave your bloodstream and move into cells where it’s then used as energy, leading to insulin resistance. That’s a stepping stone to type 2 diabetes. Although the Lancet Commission doesn’t recommend a specific dementia-preventing diet — citing inconclusive research — it does say that eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in ultra-processed foods is good for many health conditions and can reduce the dementia risk factors of obesity, diabetes, high LDL cholesterol and hypertension (high blood pressure). 4. Diabetes. Try to ﻿avoid it, especially in midlife. The focus here is type 2 diabetes, the kind that strikes later in life and leads to chronically high blood sugar levels that can damage several organs if not controlled with diet and/or medications. “Long illness duration and poorly controlled diabetes increase the risk of dementia,” the Lancet Commission wrote. “Overall improved control of diabetes … might attenuate the risk of dementia and be a way of decreasing dementia risk.” AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits 5. LDL “bad” cholesterol. Talk to your doctor about statins if levels are high.﻿ High levels of “bad” cholesterol is the second new factor that is worth changing if you want to cut dementia risk. Excess cholesterol in the brain increases stroke risk and boosts the two proteins that clump and tangle in Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid and tau. The commission points to studies showing that individual counseling about diet and exercise has a small effect on reducing LDL cholesterol. But statins, which are often prescribed to bring down high cholesterol levels, may lower risk of all types of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. Statins’ effects may be because the drugs are anti-inflammatory and they reduce cholesterol levels. 6. Hypertension. Prevent or reduce high blood pressure.﻿ Hypertension in midlife increases risk for Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Black Americans tend to have higher blood pressure than other U.S. population groups, which may be contributing to their higher risk for dementia. Eating a healthy diet, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight are all ways to prevent hypertension. Use of antihypertensive drugs has also been shown to be helpful for reducing dementia risk, the report notes. 7. Physical inactivity. Get moving, often. Is there any health condition that regular exercise doesn’t help ward off or alleviate? A review of research published in 2022 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that people who exercised regularly had roughly a 20 percent lower risk of developing dementia compared with those who didn’t. The Lancet Commission’s report suggests that exercise at any age is helpful for maintaining cognition, possibly through improved blood flow to the brain. People who engage in moderate-to-vigorous exercise on more days lose less brain volume as they age than those who do less or no exercise. The physical activity stimulates the release of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which is key to the survival of existing brain neurons and the generation of new ones. “Exercise is thought to protect the central nervous system by increasing vascular and cerebrovascular health, reducing inflammation and directly increasing neurochemistry that supports plasticity such as BDNF,” Caldwell says. “Larger brain volumes in people who exercise support this idea and indicate resilience in the face of aging.” 8. Smoking. It’s not too late to quit. If you smoke, you don’t need to be told that you shouldn’t. It raises your risk for heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and, as it turns out, dementia. That’s especially true if you’﻿re ﻿a smoker in midlife and later life, according to the Lancet Commission’s report. “Studies have suggested that long-term exposure to secondhand smoke can also increase dementia risk,” Caldwell says. The good news? It’s never too late to quit. One review of studies reported an increased dementia risk among longtime smokers, but less risk in former smokers. 9. Lack of education. Stimulate your brain. Early-life education offers the big win. Still, there are things you can do today. Sure, crossword puzzles, Wordle, Connections, Spelling Bee, Sudoku — name your obsession — play a role in stimulating the brain. But it’s more important to take on new challenges, such as learning a language or picking up a new instrument. “There’s not any evidence that any one particular thing is going to be good for reducing dementia risk,” Grant says. What matters is “that a person does something﻿.... Trying a number of new things is good for the brain.” 10. Social isolation. Stay connected with others.﻿ Nearly one in four adults 65 and older is considered socially isolated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Not to be confused with loneliness, which is the feeling of being alone regardless of the amount of social contact, social isolation is a lack of social connections. Two large research reviews cited by the Lancet Commission found a strong link between social isolation (defined in the report as some combination of living alone, seeing family or friends less than once a month and participating in no weekly group activities) and a higher risk for dementia. Does virtual connection count? Social contact in any form has a potentially beneficial effect on dementia risk by building cognitive reserve and promoting healthy behaviors. But Grant suggests that connecting through social media “is not a substitute for getting out of the house and being with people.” 11. Excessive alcohol consumption. Cut back on the booze. Less is more and none is better than some. That’s the bottom-line message of the latest research looking at the risks of drinking alcohol. Overall, the commission concluded, light drinkers, as well as heavy drinkers who cut back, have a lower risk of dementia risk than people in the habit of drinking to excess. Part of that has to do with the fact that drinking raises your risk for obesity, depression and hypertension, all risk factors for dementia. 12. Depression. Treat it effectively. Depression increases the risk of dementia at all adult ages, although in late life, some of the association is due to dementia that hasn’t yet been diagnosed. Either way, ﻿effective treatments for depression exist and are worth trying. 13. Head injury. Protect yourself from falls. True, traumatic brain injury can be caused by contact sports picked up in childhood or college. But among older adults, the main way a head injury occurs is through a fall. So you may not be able to go back and choose archery over football, but you can strengthen your core and work on your balance to avoid falls; you can also wear a helmet on bike rides. 14. Air pollution. Reduce exposure.﻿ This is a tough one, since we don’t all have the option to move away from areas of higher air pollution. Plus the rise in wildfires in recent years adds to the mix of dangerous air. The small particles carried into the air we breathe from car exhausts, industrial emissions and fires are a risk factor for dementia and cognitive impairment, the report says. But there are some steps you can take, including staying inside with windows closed or using a portable air filter when air quality is low and wearing an N95 mask when air quality is poor if you must go outside.

Yet after age 50, many of us struggle to feel well rested. “You don’t have to have a primary sleep disorder to have less than optimal sleep quality,” says Vijay Ramanan, M.D., a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic. “A range of things, from lifestyle during the day to routines at night, can have a big impact. The great thing about lifestyle modifications is that they are in our hands.” Here is our guide to achieving your best sleep. Sleep in the dark Your body’s sleep habits usually operate on a circadian rhythm, which is heavily influenced by the light/dark cycles of the sun. Darkness is best for firing up the body’s production of melatonin, a sleep hormone that dwindles as we age. You can also ease into sleep with low lighting for a couple hours before bed. Use light-blocking curtains or an eye mask to keep light out of your eyes at night. Create a sleep sanctuary in your bedroom Pajamas and bedding should be made of natural fibers to help with body temperature, which naturally drops when you sleep. Turn the heat down or keep a fan running if you feel hot. Fans can also provide white noise, which some feel helps them fall asleep. Use a pillow that supports your neck as well as your head to avoid waking up sore. Put away screens at least an hour before bed The blue light radiating from digital devices affects melatonin production. Instead, read a book, do some relaxing breathing or meditate before bed to calm your body and mind. Maintain a consistent schedule for going to bed and waking up Your circadian rhythm likes a set schedule. One hour’s difference is about all you can change when you rise or sleep without affecting your overall rest quality. Adults over age 50 need at least seven hours of sleep daily, so factor that in when you’re planning activities. “Routine helps our sleep-wake cycle. If someone is waking at different times each day, it’s likely they will struggle to fall asleep or maintain sleep throughout the night,” writes Kristen Casey, a licensed psychologist and insomnia specialist in Kansas City, Missouri, and author of the book The Insomnia Doc’s Guide to Restful Sleep. If you drink caffeine, do it early Even if you fall asleep easily, caffeine can interfere with your sleep quality. Most experts say to avoid it for at least eight hours before bedtime. Exercise Move your body midmorning or midafternoon. Exercising too early or too late in the day can affect your ability to fall asleep. “People who are more sedentary throughout the day have a low sleep drive,” says Casey. “The sleep drive is our body’s biological need for sleep. When that is low, our body doesn’t recognize the ‘need’ for sleep, even if we are exhausted!” Maintain a healthy diet Eating a nutritious diet offers many sleep benefits, according to scientists at Columbia University. Eating enough throughout the day also helps prevent hunger or binge eating before bed, which fires up the digestive system and can keep you awake. Don’t eat for at least a few hours before bedtime. Naps can harm your sleep If you absolutely must have a snooze, do it early in the afternoon for no longer than 20 minutes. Avoid alcohol in the evening A small nightcap might help bring on drowsiness, but too much alcohol circulating through your body can disrupt your sleep. Practice good oral health Dental issues, even easily addressed problems like grinding or clenching your teeth, can disrupt your sleep. Regular visits to the dentist will help ensure your dental health isn’t stealing sleep. Try to avoid bathroom breaks This one is tough! As we age, we just can’t “hold it” like we did in our younger days. To help, avoid drinking liquids after dinner, and empty your bladder just before you settle in for sleep. Get sunlight as soon as possible after waking Natural sun for 15 minutes is preferable, but bright lights for 30 minutes can also wind down your body’s natural production of melatonin. Melatonin has become popular for fighting sleep problems and it is easy to get over the counter, but it is best to talk to your doctor before taking it or supplements on your own, says Ramanan. Melatonin can have potential risks, like negative interactions with other medications you take. Sedatives can also be risky. Casey says a doctor can review your medications and when you take them to ensure yours aren’t causing sleep disturbances in any way. Consult the experts If you’ve tried all of the above consistently for a month or more and you are still not getting a satisfying sleep, see your doctor. Women over 50 could be experiencing menopause-related concerns that disrupt their sleep, while men have been found to suffer from sleep apnea two to three times as often as women, according to Ramanan. And these are just two of the numerous possible conditions only a doctor can treat. Be sure to discuss your mental well-being with your doctor as well, because anxiety or depression can also make sleep difficult. And if your partner’s snoring keeps you awake, ask them to see their doctor about it. There are treatments! As much as awareness and treatment are important to getting your best sleep, try to avoid obsessing about sleep right before bed. Doing so can cause anxiety that prevents the very thing you’re hoping to achieve. If you incorporate a sleep-optimizing lifestyle with your doctor’s advice, restful sleep should be within your grasp.

Getty Images (12) There may be no such thing as a “perfect” food, but nuts and seeds come close. These nutritional nuggets contain omega-3 fatty acids and other unsaturated fats to help reduce inflammation and promote heart health says registered dietitian Jessica Cording. With 3 to 7 grams of protein per ounce, nuts and seeds help fuel muscle maintenance and repair. They also keep you feeling full, helping with weight management. But, in addition, these morsels have an unsung superpower: They help protect your brain. In part, that’s due to their mix of healthy fats and antioxidants. But it’s also a function of their fiber content. “Eating enough fiber from food helps maintain a more balanced microbiome, which supports overall physical and mental well-being,” says Uma Naidoo, M.D., a nutritional psychiatrist and author of This Is Your Brain on Food. Because nuts are high in calories, keep your snacking to about 1 ounce (¼ cup) of nuts per day; that’s about 23 almonds or 14 walnut halves. Here are Naidoo’s choices for top nuts and seeds to keep your brain sharp. 1. Chia seeds and flaxseeds are very rich in omega 3-fatty acids in the form of ALA, or alpha-linolenic acid, which research suggests supports brain health. Use ground flaxseed to maximize your body’s ability to digest it. 2. Walnuts might be shaped like little brains for a reason: They provide higher amounts of ALA than any other nut. Emerging research also links regular intake of walnuts with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms and improved mood, says registered sports dietitian Kelly Jones. Like other nuts and seeds, they’re also rich in protein and fiber. 3. Pistachios have a positive affect on the brain’s ability to generate brain waves, including gamma waves, which are critical for cognition and memory, researchers at Loma Linda University found. Among the nuts they tested, pistachios had the greatest effect on gamma waves. 4. Almonds are by far the most potent source of vitamin E among all the nuts. Low intake of vitamin E has been linked to an increase in dementia risk. 5. Brazil nuts are a great source of selenium, an antioxidant that has been associated with improved brain health, says Cording. Just one a day will more than cover your daily need of 55 mcg. 6. Pine nuts are rich in a rare and specific fat called pinolenic acid, which has been shown to reduce inflammation levels.﻿ Raw or ﻿roasted? “You may have heard it’s better to eat raw nuts and seeds. But there’s not a big advantage, healthwise, so choose what you enjoy. “It’s more important that someone is consuming nuts and seeds at all,” says dietitian Jessica Cording. What if You’re Allergic to Tree Nuts? An estimated 3.9 million Americans are allergic to tree nuts, including almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, hazelnuts, pistachios and walnuts. That doesn’t mean they can’t enjoy similar health benefits by eating seeds, Jones says. “Roasted pumpkin seeds and hemp seeds are excellent additions to oatmeal, salads and side dishes, while flax and chia seeds are great blended into smoothies as well as oatmeal and baked goods,” she adds. Dry-roasted nuts, which are roasted without any oil, have a nutrient profile similar to raw ones. You can dry-roast nuts at home to enhance their flavor and texture; most do well baked at about 300°F until fragrant, about 10 to 25 minutes. (Different nuts cook at different rates.) There’s one caveat, though: “Do not overcook them, as that can reduce their antioxidant potential,” says dietitian Kelly Jones. Whether you’re buying whole nuts or nut butters, the same rules apply. “Look for products with as few ingredients as possible—ideally just the nuts or seeds,” Cording says. If you see oils (such as palm oil), preservatives or added sugar, keep looking. What if You’re Allergic to Tree Nuts?

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/squats-best-exercise-for-strength/,"The #1 Exercise to Do as You Get Older If you have time for only one exercise, fitness experts say, try this Mary Beth Koeth By Michelle Crouch, Updated November 10, 2023 AARP En español Published December 27, 2022 / Updated November 10, 2023 Seated? Please stand (don’t use your hands) to give tribute to the one exercise that fitness gurus say stands out among the rest for healthy aging. Now be seated again. Consider that your first rep. Yes, a great workout challenges all of the major muscle groups in your upper and lower body. But if you have time for only one exercise, you’ll get the most bang for your buck by doing squats — the classic move in which you slowly lower your bottom to seated level, then stand back up. AARP The Magazine Special Edition AARP takes a look at how aging has evolved and improved over the decades — and how it likely will change in the years ahead. Read more stories from the Age Issue “The squat is the most important exercise for seniors,” says Eric Daw, a personal trainer dedicated to older adults and founder of Omni-﻿Fitt in Toronto, Canada.﻿ “When you have to go to the washroom, that’s a squat. When you get in the car, that’s a squat. Every time you sit down or stand up, that’s a squat. If you don’t do them well, it affects the way you live.” Wall Sits Can Lower Blood Pressure Squats strengthen all of the muscle groups in your legs, including your calves, quadriceps, hamstrings and glutes, as well as muscles in your lower back and core. Those muscles provide the foundation for most activities of daily living. Squats are the antidote to soft couch-cushion syndrome — those challenging moments when we struggle to get up from that deep, old sofa. They can also help protect your joints, improve your balance and prevent falls, says Denise Austin, for 40 years one of America’s best-known fitness experts and authors. “Squats are one of the best overall exercises,” she says. “They strengthen the major muscles of the lower body we need to keep strong and also protect two joints we need help with on a regular basis — our knees and our hips.” Let’s Play Pickleball!

Read more about the joy of pickleball Som﻿e﻿ research even shows a link between strong leg muscles and longevity.﻿ In one study, people ages 70 to 79 with stronger quadriceps (the muscles along the front of the thigh) had a lower chance of dying over six years compared with those who had weaker quadriceps Here's how to get started: 1. Get in position If you’re new to squats, choose a spot where you can hold on to the kitchen counter, a table or another steady surface. Holding on for stability makes it easier to focus on your form without worrying about your balance, Austin says. Set your feet about shoulder-width apart or a little wider. (If you have hip issues, it’s OK to have your legs a little farther apart.) Toes should face slightly outward. 2. Lower into a squat Keeping your back straight, chest up and heels planted, push your hips back like you are sitting in a chair. Try to keep your weight evenly distributed on both feet as you do the exercise, with your weight mostly on your heels, not your toes, says Lori Michiel, founder of Lori Michiel Fitness, which specializes in senior fitness in the home. Make sure your knees do not extend forward over your toes, because that can hurt your knees. If you have knee or hip issues, you don’t need to do a deep bend. The coming-up part of the exercise is what really builds strength, Austin says. 3. Repeat Aim for two sets of eight to 10, at a tempo of two seconds down, two seconds up. Inhale on the way down and exhale on the way up. As your body tires at the end of the set, make sure you’re not hunching over or letting your knees cave in. For the best results, do the exercise two or three times a week. 4. Get your arms in play Mary Beth Koeth As you start to build strength, you can try doing your squats without holding on to anything. For balance, let your arms rise parallel in front of you on the downward part of the squat, then drop them to your sides when you stand up, Austin suggests. You can see Austin demonstrating how to do a mini-squat in the video below. Another option is to cross your arms across your chest. That can help keep you upright if you tend to hunch over, Daw says. 5. For a greater challenge, add resistance Mary Beth Koeth Once you can do two sets of 15 without feeling any muscle soreness afterward, you’re ready to add some weight. The easiest way is to hold a pair of dumbbells, Daw says. “That’s how you build strength faster,” he says. Start with low weights and build up. Christine Rösch New Squats for Older Legs Once you’ve mastered the basic squat, you might want to try one or more of these variations. Why? Your muscles are fast learners, so within four to six workouts, they’ll figure out how to do the same old squat exercise using less energy and fewer muscle fibers — leaving you with fewer results. Just the slightest change to the squat reminds your muscles to pay attention, which improves your overall strength and fitness and helps enhance balance. Split squats Instead of keeping your feet alongside each other, step forward with your left foot and plant it about three feet in front of your right foot. Your left foot should be flat on the floor, while your right foot — because of the angle — should have only the ball of it touching the floor with your heel slightly elevated. Either put your hands on your hips or let your arms hang down at your sides. Holding this posture, slowly squat down until your left thigh is parallel to the floor — your right knee will naturally lower down to just above the floor. Push yourself back up, repeat 6 to 8 times, then switch positions (putting your right foot forward) and repeat 6 to 8 more times. Heel-raise squats Get into the same position as a regular squat. Squat down as usual, then stand back up, but once you’re back in a standing position, keep raising up by lifting your heels off the floor as far as you can without losing balance (even a centimeter off the floor still counts). Pause at the top for a second or two if possible — if you can’t for now, that’s OK, you’ll get there! — then lower your heels back down to the floor. Repeat 8 to 10 times. Dumbbell-offset squats This exercise forces your body to find its balance. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart holding a light dumbbell in each hand. Curl the weight in your left hand up and rest the dumbbell on your left shoulder — leave your right arm hanging down at your side. Do one set of 8 to 10 repetitions of squats. Once finished, switch positions (resting the dumbbell in your right hand on your right shoulder, keeping your left arm straight) and perform a second set of 8 to 10 repetitions. Side-kick squats Position yourself as if you were about to do a traditional squat, but bring your hands up in front of your chest. Squat down, then as you push yourself back up into a standing position, shift your weight onto your right leg and gently sweep your left leg out to the side, so that you use only your right leg to push yourself back up. Bring your left foot back down into the starting position, then squat down once again, this time shifting your weight onto your left leg as you rise and gently sweep your right leg out to the side. Continue alternating from left to right for 8 to 10 repetitions. — Myatt Murphy, certified strength and conditioning specialist Mary Beth Koeth Mary Beth Koeth Christine Rösch New Squats for Older Legs Once you’ve mastered the basic squat, you might want to try one or more of these variations.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/bronchitis-vs-pneumonia/,"Bronchitis vs. Pneumonia: How to Tell Symptoms Apart These two diseases can look and feel the same, but they pose different risks By Rachel Nania, Updated December 02, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published February 01, 2024 / Updated December 02, 2024 Getty Images / AARP If it seems like more people are coughing these days, you’re not wrong. Cold and flu season is picking up, according recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And in some areas of the U.S., a few common respiratory illnesses that can cause you to whoop and hack — such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — are increasing in activity. Not only can flu, RSV, COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses make you feel miserable, but they can also lead to secondary issues, including bronchitis and pneumonia. If you’ve had a cough that you just can’t shake, you may be wondering if one of these conditions is to blame. Both share some similar symptoms, but they can require different treatments — and they pose different risks. Here’s how to tell if you have bronchitis vs. pneumonia, plus the questions you should — and shouldn’t — be asking your doctor. What is ﻿bronchitis? Acute vs. chronic bronchitis Acute bronchitis is what’s commonly called a chest cold. According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms usually improve within a week to 10 days, though the cough can persist for weeks. Chronic bronchitis is long-term inflammation of the airways and is one of the more common lung diseases that contribute to COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Bronchitis — or what’s officially called acute bronchitis — often starts out as a cold or flu-like illness. You might experience congestion or feel run-down and achy, says Neil Kalsi, M.D., an assistant professor in the University of Nebraska Medical Center ﻿Department of ﻿Family ﻿Medicine. But with bronchitis, the infection — which is almost always caused by a virus — evolves and the airways leading to the lungs get inflamed and filled with mucus. The result is a nagging cough that can persist for several weeks﻿. “It’s that cough that doesn’t go away. It’s the cough that comes up when you’re trying to laugh or talk to someone on the phone,” says Kalsi, who adds that the cough can either be dry or come with some mucus and possibly even wheezing. “But it’s a really, really annoying cough that makes it hard for people to go to work because they just can’t talk to people.” Other symptoms of bronchitis can include: Soreness in the chestFatigueBody achesSore throat How is it treated? Because bronchitis is usually caused by a virus — typically the same viruses that cause colds and the flu — antibiotics rarely help and﻿, in fact, could cause more health issues. Instead, the common prescription for recovery is plenty of rest, fluids — and even some honey. Multiple clinical trials have found that honey can help to improve the symptoms of a cough and does a better job than over-the-counter cough medicines. A summary of the research was published in 2020 in the journal BMJ Evidence﻿-Based Medicine. “If you’re going to spend the 10 bucks on a cough medicine, might as well buy some local honey instead,” Kalsi says. Just know that with bronchitis, recovery can take time, especially when it comes to getting rid of the cough. “It’s not going to be a day-by-day improvement; it’s going to be a week-by-week improvement,” Kalsi says. Acute vs. chronic bronchitis Acute bronchitis is what’s commonly called a chest cold. According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms usually improve within a week to 10 days, though the cough can persist for weeks. Chronic bronchitis is long-term inflammation of the airways and is one of the more common lung diseases that contribute to COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). What is pneumonia? While bronchitis affects the larger airways, pneumonia develops in the air sacs of the lungs. Like bronchitis, it also causes inflammation and fluid buildup. Viruses, bacteria and fungi can all cause pneumonia. In the U.S., some of the more common causes of viral pneumonia include influenza, RSV﻿, COVID-19 and rhinovirus (the predominant cause of the common cold), according to the CDC. When it comes to bacteria, pneumococcus, which causes pneumococcal disease, is often to blame. The bug can be which can be spread by coughing, sneezing or touching infected surfaces. Like bronchitis, pneumonia can trigger a bad cough that may come with mucus. But other symptoms of pneumonia tend to be more serious and can include: Fever, shaking and chillsShortness of breathRapid, shallow breathingChest painLoss of appetiteFatigueConfusion, especially in older adults With pneumonia, “you can feel much more run-down, fatigued﻿, short of breath,” Kalsi says. “It can be much more intense.” According to the American Lung Association, pneumonia causes more than 1 million hospitalizations and more than 50,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Chest X-rays, ultrasound, CT scans and other techniques may be used to diagnose pneumonia. A second test is sometimes used to confirm the diagnosis. How is it treated? That depends on what’s causing the infection. If it’s bacterial pneumonia — a blood, sputum or urine test can help identify the cause — your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic. And antifungals can help treat pneumonia caused by a fungal infection. Viral pneumonia usually isn’t treated with prescription medication. However, your doctor may recommend prescription or over-the-counter cold medicines or fever reducers to help with symptoms. Don’t ignore severe signs A fever that’s higher than 101 degrees F﻿. is concerning and is a sign you need to see a doctor, says Anthony Szema, M.D., who specializes in pulmonary diseases and clinical immunology at Hofstra/ Northwell on Long Island, New York. The same goes if you are short of breath﻿, or if your breathing worsens, or if you are extremely fatigued or feel dehydrated. “If you are wheezing and waking up at night with chest tightness, those are all reasons to seek medical care,” Kalsi says. It may be the case that your illness is severe enough to require extra care in the hospital. Preventing bronchitis and pneumonia The good news: You can do a few things to reduce your risk of coming down with bronchitis or pneumonia. The pneumococcal vaccine, which is now recommended for adults 50 and older, can help reduce the risk of pneumonia caused by pneumococcus bacteria. Similarly, the vaccines for COVID-19, RSV and influenza can lower the likelihood of those infections and the complications they can cause. And don’t forget about frequent handwashing and face masks, which can help block the spread of many germs, including those that can cause bronchitis and pneumonia. “The pandemic taught us how effective just wearing a mask can be,” says Kalsi, who adds that people with lung issues like asthma and emphysema will want to take extra precautions. Szema also recommends air purifiers using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in bedrooms and common rooms. These portable machines can help to remove germs from the air. Questions to ask — and to avoid If your doctor suspects your illness is caused by a virus, it’s important to not push for antibiotics if they aren’t recommended. Remember, antibiotics only help to treat bacterial infections. Still, “a lot of people request antibiotics for their bronchitis,” Kalsi says. Research suggests viruses cause 85 to 95 percent of acute bronchitis cases in healthy adults. Here are some questions you should be asking your doctor if you have a bad cough: Should I be concerned if I develop a fever?Do I need a chest X-ray or other medical tests?What’s the best course of treatment?Can I take over-the-counter medications with my routine prescription drugs?What should I do if symptoms linger?Are there any severe signs I need to be on the lookout for?

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fast-constipation-relief/,"8 Ways to Get Fast Relief from Constipation Tips and remedies for fast relief By Lauren Evoy Davis, AARP Comments En español Published May 20, 2025 Getty Images Millions of older people suffer from constipation, sometimes for years. Long-term constipation is not only uncomfortable, it's also linked to hemorrhoids and other health problems, so it's important to try to stay regular. There’s no magic number for how often a person should have a bowel movement, but if you aren’t going at least three times per week or have trouble passing stool, you might have a form of constipation, according to the National Institute on Aging. This common condition affects 26 percent of women and 16 percent of men age 65 and up. This increases to 34 percent of women and 26 percent of men age 84 and older, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Read on the learn the causes and treatments to help you go more regularly. Causes of constipation Having a difficult time going to the bathroom gets worse as we age. Culprits include a lack of fiber in the diet, not drinking enough water, inactivity, medications, supplements, hormonal fluctuations, bowel disorders and conditions that affect movement, like Parkinson’s disease. I If you are struggling and straining on the toilet, you are more likely to have hemorrhoids, inflamed veins around your lower rectum, which about half of people age 50 have them according to the National Institutes of Health. In addition, with joint issues, or osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, can affect how well and often people move around. So, limitation in physical activity is a very big thing, says Margaret Schwiesow, gastroenterologist with Kaiser Permanente in Falls Church, VA. Stress and trauma also play a role in digestive issues. Bessel van der Kolk, M.D. talks about how the body stores trauma in his best seller “The Body Keeps The Score,” and addresses the delicate equilibrium in our mind–body connection. From the book, “Traumatized people chronically feel unsafe inside their bodies: The past is alive in the form of gnawing interior discomfort. Their bodies are constantly bombarded by visceral warning signs, and, in an attempt to control these processes, they often become expert at ignoring their gut feelings and in numbing awareness of what is played out inside.” Medications such as antidepressants to treat mental health conditions caused by stress and trauma can also affect digestion and cause constipation. The good news is that there’s a lot of options for you to get relief. What helps with constipation? The good news is there are lots of options to help you feel better. Here are eight things you can do to help you get relief. 1. Water “My simple rule of thumb for people is minimum half your body weight in ounces of water a day,” says gastroenterologist Robynne Chutkan, M.D. who sees patients at Georgetown University Hospital. She is the author of four books on gut health and host of the podcast Gutbliss where she discusses constipation and other GI ills. “I recommend first thing in the morning, because when you drink a big glass of water, that triggers something called the gastrocolic reflex, which is the message your stomach sends to your colon to say food is coming in or drink is coming in,” she says, which stimulates the colon to contract. Water can also help fiber move through the digestive system, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Not getting enough water can result in dried stool that is difficult to pass. 2. Fiber How to Add More Fiber to Your Diet Increase healthy fiber with these foods, including grams of fiber per serving size. Split peas (boiled): 1 cup, 16 grams Lentils (boiled): 1 cup, 15.5 grams Prunes: 1 cup, 12 grams Chia seeds: 1 ounce, 10 grams Raspberries: 1 cup, 8 grams Kiwis: 1 cup, 5 grams Oat bran muffin: 1 medium, 5 grams Broccoli: 1 cup, 5 grams Oatmeal, instant, cooked: 1 cup, 4 grams Almonds: 1 ounce, 3.5 grams Strawberries: 1 cup, 3 grams Source: High-fiber foods - Mayo Clinic There are two types of fiber you can eat to optimize digestion. Insoluble fiber: These types of fiber — raw veggie and fruit skin, seeds, nuts, and leafy greens — evacuates the body in the same condition in went in.Soluble fiber: These types of fiber — apples (no skin), cooked veggies, oatmeal — dissolves in the digestive system. The elephant in the room, according to Schwiesow, is the lack of fiber. To optimize gut health you need 25 to 30 grams per day, but she said some people are not meeting the minimum requirements and suffering the consequence. She reminds her patients fiber is in more than fruits and vegetables but also in nuts and legumes. She champions kiwis as a superfood to add to their diet. The skin is edible too and can increase the fiber content by 50 percent, although it might seem strange to eat given its fuzzy texture. Schwiesow tells her patients to think of fiber as a brush that goes through your colon, and it sweeps down all the and the toxins from your entire digestive system. 3. Does coffee make you poop? Yes, your morning cup of joe can help you go, according to a 2022 article in the journal Nutrients. Coffee stimulates the colon and releases a hormone that triggers the gallbladder to release bile and digestive enzymes to assist with the emptying of the bowels. The more coffee you consume, the odds of you having constipation decrease, according to a study of more than 13,000 coffee drinkers. Decaf also works but it triggers the colon less than caffeinated brew. Schwiesow recommends her patients who like coffee should have one cup to get things moving. She also cites health benefits of coffee, which has plenty of polyphenols — nutrients in plants that manage inflammation — or antioxidants, which are vitamins and nutrients that can protect your health. Not a coffee connoisseur? Sip hot water with lemon or hot tea to get some relief. The heat of the drink stimulates the bowels. 4. Exercise Strength training and cardiovascular exercise, according to Schwiesow, can help with digestion and ease constipation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says you need about 150 minutes of exercise per week, which is a 21-minute walk per day. Chutkan says the best time to walk is after a meal because it stimulates digestion and helps move the food through your digestive system. The worst thing you can do after eating is sitting on the couch. How to Add More Fiber to Your Diet Increase healthy fiber with these foods, including grams of fiber per serving size. Split peas (boiled): 1 cup, 16 grams Lentils (boiled): 1 cup, 15.5 grams Prunes: 1 cup, 12 grams Chia seeds: 1 ounce, 10 grams Raspberries: 1 cup, 8 grams Kiwis: 1 cup, 5 grams Oat bran muffin: 1 medium, 5 grams Broccoli: 1 cup, 5 grams Oatmeal, instant, cooked: 1 cup, 4 grams Almonds: 1 ounce, 3.5 grams Strawberries: 1 cup, 3 grams Source: High-fiber foods - Mayo Clinic 5. Pelvic floor therapy A pelvic floor physical therapy can check for weak muscles and spasms by performing a pelvic exam and, for women, a rectal exam. “Physical Therapy is, I think, a great tool that's underused, in particular pelvic floor physical therapy for a woman,” says Chutkan who describes the pelvic floor is like a hammock. In this hammock women have GI organs and reproductive organs. As we get older, that pelvic floor tends to weaken and fall. And so “I see a lot of pelvic floor issues, more in women than men, but sometimes in men.” Denise Moon, physical therapist and a specialist in pelvic floor disorders at Pivot Therapy in North Beach, Maryland. She advises patients to exercise. “I always tell patients that the best kind of exercise is the exercise that they enjoy the most. Through making lifestyle changes and adding movement to their lives, I can see changes as soon as one to two sessions with my patients with constipation.” 6. Yoga Moon suggests yoga and Pilates because both work on belly breathing, working the abdominal core and posture, all which are key concepts in treating constipation. The practice of yoga can improve digestive health and improve quality of sleep in older people, according to a randomized trial which showed improvements in both after three months. Participants in the study reported a better quality of life. Although this was a small study, the improvements were significant and show promise for more people going forward. Other research studied meditation and yoga for IBS. When seventy-nine people participated in a virtual yoga practice, IBS symptoms decreased for 54.7 percent of the group during the 8-week period, according to a 2023 article published in the journal American Journal of Gastroenterology . 7. Acupuncture People can try alternative therapies, like the ancient practice of acupuncture, to reduce constipation symptoms and reduce some types of pain. Studies show acupuncture can increase the number of stools and relieve constipation by changing the gut, stimulating the muscles in the digestive system, and reducing stress. In a randomized controlled trial, researchers found that acupuncture increased bowel movements from less than once per week to 2.6 times per week during an 8-week treatment of 536 people. 8. Magnesium citrate A few types of magnesium are available over the counter, but the one you want for constipation relief is magnesium citrate. This supplement draws water into the intestine and helps you go, according to the Cleveland Clinic. As with any new medication or supplement, be sure to ask your doctor if this is safe for you because it could interact with certain medications, like those to increase bone strength. Types of Constipation Constipation shows up in a few different ways Normal-transit constipation: Occurs when people have difficulty fully evacuating the colon. They may experience abdominal pain, distension (when the abdomen juts out). People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or emotional stress, typically have this type of constipation. Slow-transit constipation: Passing the stool through the colon is delayed. This happens more to women than men, due in part to hormonal fluctuations. Outlet constipation: Also called pelvic floor dysfunction, people with this type of issue have severe difficulty expelling stools. The combination of hydration, movement, nutrition, and stress management can help alleviate constipation. If you are having frequent bouts of it, you should see your doctor or a GI specialist.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/getting-accurate-alzheimers-diagnosis/,"Concerned About Alzheimer’s Disease? How to Get an Accurate Diagnosis For Latinos, barriers often get in the way of early detection. Here are 6 steps to discovering the cause of memory problems Getty / AARP By Michelle Crouch, AARP En español Published November 16, 2022 Latinos, the fastest-growing group of older adults in the United States, are one and a half times more likely than non-Latino whites to develop Alzheimer’s disease or another dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. To explain the disparity, researchers point to socioeconomic factors, limited access to high-quality care and a higher incidence of health conditions such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Yet despite having a higher rate of Alzheimer’s, Latinos are also more likely to have a delayed or missed diagnosis, according to an analysis published in in August 2021. That’s significant, experts say, because detecting the disease early can lead to better treatment options and more time to prepare for the future. “Early detection is critical,” says Jacobo Mintzer, M.D., a staff physician and principal investigator of Alzheimer’s disease research at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center in South Carolina. “We know that changes in lifestyle can substantially reduce your chance of progression of the disease. There are also a number of new compounds in the pipeline that will likely work best in the early stages of the disease.” Cultural and structural barriers A variety of structural and cultural factors are keeping Hispanic Americans from being diagnosed sooner, experts say. The Mini-Cog is a 3-minute cognitive assessment that includes a recall test for memory and a scored clock-drawing test. MICROGEN IMAGES / Getty Images In the Hispanic community, as in many other groups, there is a deep stigma around Alzheimer’s, with many people not wanting to acknowledge a problem. About 20 percent of Latinos say they would feel insulted if a doctor suggested a cognitive assessment, compared to 10 percent of non-Hispanic white Americans, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Because Latino cultures value respect for the elderly, some may feel it’s disrespectful to question an older adult’s actions when they start to show signs of impairment. In addition, there is a widespread belief in the Hispanic community that memory problems are just a normal part of aging. Structural barriers built into the American health care system also make it harder for Hispanics to get a diagnosis. Patients may not have the time to take off work to go to the doctor. They might lack transportation. Or they may not have health insurance. “I hear things like ‘I can’t take the day off,’ ‘It’s going to be too expensive’ or ‘The waiting is so long,’ ” says Elizabeth Muñoz, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who researches predictors of adult cognitive health. Once a Latino patient connects with a health care provider, other problems can arise. There can be language barriers, a lack of staff available who know how to diagnose dementia, and a general distrust of the health care system, says Maria Mora Pinzon, a preventive medicine physician and scientist with the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. One-third of Hispanic Americans report that they have experienced discrimination when seeking health care, according to surveys conducted by the Alzheimer’s Association. The Mini-Cog is a 3-minute cognitive assessment that includes a recall test for memory and a scored clock-drawing test. MICROGEN IMAGES / Getty Images 6 ﻿steps to take for getting a diagnosis If you have concerns about a loved one with memory issues, experts say these six steps can help﻿. 1. Recognize the early warning signs of Alzheimer's While some forgetfulness is normal as you get older, experts say an important warning sign of Alzheimer’s is if you notice that your loved one is having a hard time doing things they used to enjoy. For example, if somebody always prepares breakfast for the family but now, “when they try to do it, it’s getting burned, it has too much salt or they forget the recipe, that’s reason for concern,” Mora Pinzon says. Another warning sign: Behavior that is out of the ordinary — say your mom, who used to be very active, now stays in bed for much of the day. Compared to their peers from other ethnic groups, Latino patients with early Alzheimer’s are more likely to report anxiety and depression, according to the latest research. They’re also more likely to struggle with the activities of daily life, research shows. Check out AARP’s list of 10 warning signs of dementia you shouldn’t ignore and the Alzheimer’s Association’s 10 warning signs of Alzheimer’s. 2. Start the conversation If you’re worried about a family member, it’s important to voice your concerns in a supportive and loving way. Initiate the conversation in a calm and quiet environment, suggests Monica Moreno, senior director for care and support for the Alzheimer’s Association. Start by sharing what you’ve noticed, and ask if they have noticed changes too. Latinos and Alzheimer's: A Growing Crisis The latest research, getting a diagnosis, handling finances and coping with caregiving. Real stories, resources and advice “That can really open the lines of conversation,” Moreno says. “A lot of times they may have noticed the symptoms, but they’re afraid to bring it up.” Since Alzheimer’s Association surveys show most Hispanics (57 percent) believe that significant memory loss is a normal part of aging, the conversation can include helping them understand that’s not true. No matter how supportive you are, the conversation may trigger feelings of anger, fear, shame or failure — so don’t be surprised if you meet resistance. “As difficult as it is, it’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon,” Moreno says. “You may have to have multiple conversations over time before the person agrees to go see a doctor.” For more tips on having this difficult conversation, the Alzheimer’s Association offers 10 steps, in both English and Spanish, about how to approach memory concerns in others. 3. See a primary care doctor Encourage your family member to share their concerns with their primary care doctor, and offer to accompany them to the visit. “Remind them that it may not be Alzheimer’s or dementia — maybe it’s just a vitamin deficiency,” suggests Mora Pinzon. A physician can do bloodwork and perform other tests to determine if something besides dementia is causing their memory problems. In addition to a vitamin deficiency, possibilities include sleep apnea, an infection or the side effects of a medication. If the results of those tests are negative, some primary care doctors will initiate an Alzheimer’s screening themselves. Others will refer you to a specialist. 4. Find a specialist you are comfortable with Several types of doctors screen and diagnose patients for brain disorders, including neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists and geriatricians. Dementia diagnostic centers, Alzheimer’s Disease Centers or Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers also do the screenings and typically have more than one specialist on staff. For Hispanic patients, it’s important that the screening is done by a culturally sensitive doctor, ideally one from a similar ethnic background, Mora Pinzon says. Almost nine out of 10 Hispanics (more than 85 percent) say it is important for Alzheimer’s providers to understand their ethnic or racial background and experiences, according to Alzheimer’s Association research. “I’d ask for a referral to a physician who understands brain disorders and who looks and sounds like me,” Mintzer says. “If there’s no Latino doctor, try to find a doctor who knows dementia, and educate them on the uniqueness of your loved one.” If there’s a language barrier, make sure the center has Spanish versions of its cognitive tests as well as Spanish-speaking staff members to administer them, Mora Pinzon says. “If they say they will do the tests with a translator and translate as it’s happening, that’s not very accurate,” she says. “In that case, it’s worth looking for another place, where they can administer the test in the language of preference.” 5. Prepare for the testing Because there is no single diagnostic test that can determine if a person has Alzheimer’s disease, doctors use a variety of tests and tools to make the diagnosis. Talking to your family member in advance about the different types of tests can help the appointment seem less frightening and overwhelming. If your family member has anxiety and is scheduled for an MRI, ask the doctor to explain in advance what they should expect. Some facilities have audio systems that allow patients to listen to their favorite music during the scan, and that can be helpful. Finally, make sure your family member eats breakfast before they go and is prepared for several hours of testing. “Depending on what tests they’re using and how complicated the case is, it can take a whole day,” Mora Pinzon says. If you don’t think your loved one can handle a long appointment, Mora Pinzon suggests asking if the screening can be split over two appointments. 6. Find information and support The Alzheimer’s Association, AARP and other organizations have a plethora of resources to help as you and your family member navigate through this stressful time. Start with these resources. Alzheimer’s Association Helpline: Call 800-272-3900 to speak with a master’s level clinician in English or Spanish about your concerns and next steps. Community Resource Finder: Type your zip code or city and state into this database created by the Alzheimer’s Association and AARP to find a medical professional, community services and more. Alzheimer’s Association Education Center: Take an online course on a variety of topics related to Alzheimer’s and dementia. Global Council on Brain Health: Explore trusted information on how you can maintain and improve your brain health. Reports and infographics with recommendations and practical tips on cognitively stimulating activities, nutrition, exercise, supplements and more are available in English and Spanish. Staying Sharp (for AARP members): Access digital information and resources in English and Spanish on brain health, including articles, recipes, games and activities. Breaking Down Barriers A growing number of health care, academic and advocacy organizations nationwide are recognizing health inequities and working to help bridge the gap for Latinos and other ethnic groups. The Alzheimer Association’s 77 chapters are actively involved in outreach to diverse communities, says Monica Moreno, senior director for care and support. “We are strategically working with chapters to reach out to community leaders and better understand what challenges they face when it comes to Alzheimer’s disease﻿ and what they feel like they need,” she says. “Our chapters then work with leaders to come up with a plan.” Researchers are also working to better understand dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in Latinos and to include more Latinos in clinical trials. In addition, many organizations and advocacy groups, including AARP and the Alzheimer’s Association, now offer Spanish-language resources. They are also studying whether genetics and other biological factors impact the brain differently in different populations.

Here’s How Long You Need to Isolate Vaccines, treatments remain highly important for older adults By Rachel Nania, Updated July 18, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published February 16, 2024 / Updated July 18, 2024 Paul Spella (Getty Images, 2) ﻿This summer, an increasing number of people are finding that their sniffles, sore throat and cough aren’t allergies but actually COVID-19. Cases of COVID are increasing in many areas of the U.S., the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, as are emergency room visits and hospitalizations from the virus, particularly among people age 65-plus. Even deaths, which remain low compared to previous pandemic peaks, are once again creeping up. Wondering what steps you need to take if you test positive for COVID-19? The CDC recently updated its guidance to say that people with COVID-19 can return to work, school and other activities if their symptoms are mild and improving and they’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medicine. Once normal activities resume, additional prevention steps are recommended for at least five days to help curb the spread of the disease. All about coronavirus COVID’s summer wave Summer cold or COVID? Isolation guidelines change Members only: COVID 4 times Eligible for a booster shot? Medicare coverage details These steps — wearing a mask, improving air quality in your home, handwashing and keeping a distance from others — are especially important for older adults and people who spend time around older adults, the CDC says. Seeking treatment for COVID-19 and staying up-to-date on vaccines is also key for older adults and others who are at higher risk for a severe case of COVID-19. Previous guidelines called for people with COVID-19 to isolate for at least five days from the start of symptoms or a positive test﻿, and to wear a mask though day 10 to avoid spreading the illness to others. The CDC says the updated guidance “brings a unified approach to addressing risks from a range of common respiratory viral illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu and RSV, which can cause significant health impacts and strain on hospitals and health care workers.” This approach makes recommendations easier to follow, the public health agency says, and it makes it more likely that people will adopt them. All about coronavirus COVID’s summer wave Summer cold or COVID? Isolation guidelines change Members only: COVID 4 times Eligible for a booster shot? Medicare coverage details The change also “reflects how the circumstances around COVID-19 in particular have changed,” the CDC said in a statement. “While it remains a threat, today it is far less likely to cause severe illness because of widespread immunity and improved tools to prevent and treat the disease.” At this point, the majority of people in the population have built up some sort of immunity to COVID-19, either through vaccination, infection or both, health researchers say. The updated guidelines are just for community settings; the CDC says there are no changes to respiratory virus guidance for health care settings. Don’t ignore treatment, vaccines Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta, says it’s important to not dismiss the virus and to remember that “COVID is still a very significant burden of long-term illness and death.” More than 350 Americans died from COVID-19 the week of June 22, CDC data shows. And the death rate for older Americans continues to tower over younger populations. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “We still must use the commonsense solutions we know work to protect ourselves and others from serious illness from respiratory viruses — this includes vaccination, treatment and staying home when we get sick,” CDC Director Mandy Cohen, M.D., said in a statement. Paul Offit, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the author of the book Tell Me When It’s Over: An Insider’s Guide to Deciphering COVID Myths and Navigating Our Post-Pandemic World, tells AARP that when it comes to COVID-19, “at least half of the hospitalizations and deaths in people who are at high risk are in people who never [got treated].” A study published in January found that only 12.2 percent of 309,755 patients eligible for Paxlovid received a prescription. Another study, yet to be peer reviewed, found that only 9.7 percent of more than 1 million high-risk patients received the treatment. Paxlovid and other antiviral medications, such as Lagevrio and Veklury, are recommended for older adults — who make up the majority of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths — and people with underlying health conditions, like heart disease or lung disease. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. These medications “work extremely well at mitigating symptoms and shortening the amount of time that people are sick and how sick they feel while they have it,” Guest says. The key is starting these antiviral medications right away — within the first five days of symptom onset, says William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. “We tend to say, ‘Oh, I’ll see if it gets better tomorrow. I don’t want to bother the doctor with this,’ ” Schaffner says. “Do this as quickly as possible, because if you have either flu or COVID, instituting the treatments early gives you the best benefit. The longer you wait, the less effective the treatments are.” Another tool available to older adults: a second dose of the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine. Health officials said in February that adults 65 and older should get another shot, as long as it’s been four months since their last, “to provide added protection that may have decreased over time for those at highest risk.” Three versions of this vaccine are available in doctors’ offices and pharmacies: an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech and a protein-based vaccine from Novavax. A new vaccine for the 2024–2025 season is expected in the fall. Another important point, Offit says, is to remember that it’s not just COVID-19 that can cause people to get seriously ill. Flu and RSV send hundreds of thousands of people to the hospital each year too. Like for COVID, vaccines also help prevent severe illness from these infections. Offit says the key message is to stay home if you’re sick. “Or if you can’t stay home because your work doesn’t allow you to stay home, then wear a mask,” he says. “The bottom line is that when people follow these actionable recommendations to avoid getting sick, and to protect themselves and others if they do get sick, it will help limit the spread of respiratory viruses, and that will mean fewer people who experience severe illness,” National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Demetre Daskalakis, M.D., said in a statement. “That includes taking enhanced precautions that can help protect people who are at higher risk for getting seriously ill.” Editor’s note: This story, first published Feb. 16, 2024, has been updated to reflect a change in guidelines.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/measles-outbreaks-01-2024/,"Do I Need a Measles Shot at My Age? What older adults should know about immunity to the virus as cases climb By Rachel Nania, Updated April 01, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published January 24, 2024 / Updated April 01, 2025 Getty Images The U.S. has seen more measles cases this year than it did in all of 2024, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. As of April 3, 607 cases of the highly contagious disease have been reported in 2025 across 22 U.S. jurisdictions. The vast majority of these cases were in unvaccinated individuals or in people of unknown vaccine status. In 2024, the United States had 285 total cases. Two children have died in Texas from measles complications. One death in an adult in New Mexico is still under investigation, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. That unvaccinated adult tested positive for measles, but the cause of death has not been confirmed. If these numbers don't seem particularly alarming, know that “even one case of measles is something that we should all sit up and pay attention to,” says Patricia A. Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and immediate past-president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “And the reason for that is, it is the most contagious and easily transmittable virus that we have.” Here’s what you need to know about measles as new cases surface, including the best way to protect yourself. 1. Measles is highly contagious Like many other viruses, measles spreads through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. ﻿ But unlike other common viruses, measles is so contagious that up to 90 percent of people who are close to an infected person will become infected if they are not immune to the virus, according to the CDC. “It doesn’t have to be cough right in your face,” Stinchfield says. Tiny virus particles can survive in the air for two hours, where they “circulate around and bounce over to this person and that person, and before you know it, you’ve exposed a lot of people,” she says. What’s more, a person infected with measles can spread the virus four days before the most obvious symptom — a telltale rash — appears, and for four days after. 2. Many older adults have immunity With the current outbreak, you might be wondering: Do I need the measles vaccine? If you’ve had measles — and you probably have if you were born before 1957, the CDC says — it’s unlikely you’ll get it again. You’re also considered immune if you’ve had the two-dose MMR vaccine, given for measles, mumps and rubella. According to the CDC, two doses of MMR is about 97 percent effective at preventing measles — and that protection lasts a lifetime. However, people vaccinated before 1968 and those vaccinated between 1968 and 1989 may need an additional dose of MMR, says Robert H. Hopkins, Jr., M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. That’s because some adults may have been given a less effective vaccine that was administered in the '60s before MMR was available, or some may have received only one dose of MMR initially. (One dose of MMR vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles, the CDC says.) If you can’t remember whether you’ve had the illness or two shots of MMR vaccine, talk to your doctor. The CDC says there is no harm in getting another dose of the vaccine, even if you have prior immunity. (Hopkins notes that immunocompromised or pregnant people should not receive the measles vaccine.) Keep in mind that no vaccine is 100 percent effective, and about 3 out of 100 people who are fully vaccinated for measles will get it if exposed to the virus, the CDC says. Fully vaccinated people who get measles typically experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people. ""The best defense against measles is vaccination,"" Hopkins says. 3. Without population immunity, measles can spread Because the virus spreads so easily, you need a high level of immunity in the community — or about 95 percent of the population immunized — to prevent ongoing transmission, says John Schieffelin, M.D., an infectious disease physician and associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. Research shows that the U.S. is under that threshold. During the 2023–2024 school year, MMR vaccination coverage among kindergartners was 92.7 percent, down from 95 percent in pre-pandemic years, according to CDC data. This translates to roughly 280,000 kindergartners who are at risk for measles. In some states, measles vaccine coverage among children is under 85 percent. Vaccine misinformation is partially to blame for this dip, Stinchfield says. So is the pandemic, since many non-urgent doctor’s appointments were skipped or delayed, and so routine vaccinations were missed. (The first dose of the MMR vaccine is typically given around the first birthday; the second dose is around kindergarten entry.) If vaccination rates continue to decline, measles could reestablish itself in the U.S., health experts warn. “Any kind of drop in our vaccine rates, we need to pay attention to and get them back up where they belong,” says Stinchfield, who adds that grandparents can help play a role by talking to their children and grandchildren about vaccines. 4. Measles can be dangerous, even deadly Schieffelin says a common misconception is that measles isn’t a big deal, since virtually everyone used to get infected. But that is not the case. Common symptoms — which include fever, cough, runny nose — can cause a person to feel “miserable,” says Stinchfield, who helped take care of hospitalized children during a large measles outbreak in Minnesota in the 1990s. Three to five days into the illness, a rash breaks out and spreads from the top of the head down the body. At this point, a fever can spike to more than 104°F, the CDC says. The thing with measles, though, is that it’s not uncommon for the illness to turn severe. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the U.S. who get measles end up in the hospital, according to the CDC. Complications range from dehydration to pneumonia to encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. Measles can also mess with your immunity to other illnesses, Stinchfield says — a phenomenon called immune amnesia. Young children are at increased risk for these complications; so are older adults, Schieffelin says. “As we get older, we don’t tolerate [viruses] quite as well,” he says. It’s estimated 136,200 people worldwide, mostly children, died from measles in 2022, according to a report from the CDC and the World Health Organization. 5. Unvaccinated travelers can spread measles Most people in the U.S. are protected against measles with the vaccine, but the virus hasn’t been eliminated worldwide. In fact, the global vaccination rate for both MMR doses hovers around 74 percent, according to the CDC. In some countries, it’s as low as 66 percent. An unvaccinated traveler who picks up a case in another country can bring it to the U.S. and spread it to other unvaccinated people, Stinchfield says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/strep-throat-or-sore-throat/,"Is It a Sore Throat or Strep Throat? How to Tell the Difference Even if you don’t have strep, there are﻿ reasons to see a doctor By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published February 15, 2024 Getty Images/AARP A single swallow feels as though a thousand tiny daggers are stabbing the inside of your neck. No doubt you have a sore throat. But is it strep? While the most common cause of a sore throat is a virus — including the viruses that cause the common cold and flu — other triggers, including allergies, postnasal drip and environmental irritants can cause the throat to be sore. So can a bacteria group known as A Streptococcus, or﻿ group A strep, which is to blame for strep throat, a highly contagious illness that is most common in the winter and spring seasons. What are the symptoms of strep throat? “There isn't any single symptom that you hang your hat on to rule in or rule out strep,” says John Mafi, M.D., a primary care physician and associate professor of medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research at University of California, Los Angeles. Rather, it’s a combination of symptoms that can help you spot strep throat; but just know that a simple swab of the throat at the doctor’s office is the only way to confirm it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who have strep also tend to experience: FeverRed and swollen tonsilsWhite patches or streaks of pus on the tonsilsA sore throat that started quickly and may appear red Also common with strep throat is tender and swollen lymph nodes, says Viviana S. Martinez-Bianchi, M.D., a family medicine physician at Duke Health. And some people, especially kids and teenagers, will get “a little rash that is red and feels like sandpaper﻿,” she says. When strep throat is accompanied by a rash, which often starts on the neck, underarm and groin before spreading over the body, it's referred to as scarlet fever. Sometimes people with strep can get a headache or experience nausea or vomiting. On the other hand, a cough, runny nose, pink eye and a raspy or hoarse voice are all signs that your sore throat stems from a viral infection and is not strep, the CDC says. “When we start seeing all of those other symptoms, we're thinking it's more likely to be a virus than bacteria,” Martinez-Bianchi says. Can older adults get strep? While strep is often associated with school-age children, adults are not immune to the painful and contagious illness. About 1 in 10 adults with a sore throat has strep throat, the CDC says. “A lot of people think, ‘Oh, I'm an older adult; I don’t have it, I had it as a kid.’ But it's not one of those things that if you had it once you're not going to get it again,” Martinez-Bianchi says. So if you were around someone with strep throat and go on to develop symptoms, get tested for it. Strep spreads very easily and in the same way that many illnesses do: through respiratory droplets — from coughs and sneezes, for example — and direct contact with an infected person. Because strep is caused by a bacterial infection, it’s treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, the infection can lead to complications, including kidney inflammation, a bloodstream infection and rheumatic fever, a serious condition that can damage the heart. Mafi says while older adults aren’t necessarily more susceptible to serious illness from strep throat, it’s important to remember that “the older you are, the more likely that any infection can lead to complications.” When to see a doctor If you think you have strep, you should see a doctor to get tested and treated. Results from a rapid test are available in minutes. However, even if you think your sore throat is not due to strep, there are instances that warrant a doctor’s visit. For example, the viruses that cause COVID-19 and flu can cause a sore throat, so if you suspect you have one of these illnesses, call your health care provider. There are prescription antiviral treatments for both flu and COVID-19, and these medicines can reduce the risk of serious symptoms that can be especially dangerous for older adults and that can lead to other complications like pneumonia. The take-home message, Mafi says, is “if you're older, you have chronic comorbidities, you're vulnerable for different reasons, then you should be more vigilant.” Another warning sign that you need medical attention is if you’re having so much pain and trouble swallowing that you’re drooling; this could be a sign of an abscess, Martinez-Bianchi says. Worsening symptoms, a high fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain and blood in the saliva or mucus are other signs that you should see a doctor. Relieving sore throat symptoms If it’s a virus causing your sore throat, antibiotics won’t help﻿ and can﻿, in fact, cause additional health issues,﻿ including diarrhea or rash, Mafi says. But several other remedies may bring relief, the CDC says, including: Ice chips, popsicles, or lozengesGargling with salt waterDrinking plenty of fluidsOver-the-counter pain relievers, though you should always check with your doctor first to discuss any side effects or potential drug interactions.Rest. “You really need to take at least a day or two to really let your body rest and recover,” Mafi says. And don’t forget about honey. A large review of studies published in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine found that honey is more effective than over-the-counter medications for cough and cold symptoms, including sore throat. “So I actually advise my patients to take honey,” Mafi says, though it’s not recommended for people who are immunosuppressed or for infants. “But, in general, it's very safe and it is effective.” Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","The article explores the differences between a sore throat and strep throat, and how to determine whether a sore throat is caused by a viral or bacterial infection.

A surprising insight is that adults, including older adults, can contract strep throat, with about 1 in 10 adults with a sore throat having the condition, and that it's not a guarantee that having it once means you won't get it again.",23
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fda-restricts-covid-vaccine-access/,"Can You Still Get a COVID-19 Vaccine at Any Age? Health officials announce changes that will likely curb access to shots for some people under age 65 By Rachel Nania, Updated May 30, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published May 21, 2025 / Updated May 30, 2025 Getty Images U.S. health officials are proposing changes to recommendations for the coronavirus vaccine just months ahead of the fall vaccine season. The developments are raising new questions and creating some confusion about who could — and should — get the shot. Earlier this month, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, M.D., and FDA commissioner Martin Makary, M.D., published in article in the New England Journal of Medicine saying that rather than making the shots available to all individuals 6 months and older, like they have been for several years, the agency plans to limit COVID vaccine eligibility to adults 65 and older and individuals with at least one underlying health condition that increases their risk of severe illness from a coronavirus infection. Such conditions include asthma, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer and physical inactivity, among many others. The authors said that for people between the ages of 6 months and 64 years who don’t have any risk factors for severe COVID, “the FDA anticipates the need for randomized, controlled trial data” to evaluate the benefit of the vaccines before licensing them for younger populations. It’s important to note that the COVID-19 vaccine remains on the child immunization schedule for individuals ages 6 months to 17 years, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that children and their parents can receive the vaccine in consultation with their doctor — a process known as shared decision-making. Days after the journal article was published, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., said on social media that the vaccine would also no longer be recommended for healthy pregnant women, despite pregnancy being a risk factor for severe illness. Doctors familiar with the framework say it’s unclear how changes in the vaccine policy would affect insurance coverage for individuals under the age of 65 who have no risk factors. Typically, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel of independent experts that advises the CDC, recommends how federally approved vaccines should be used. Insurers are required to cover certain vaccines recommended by ACIP and adopted by the CDC. Changes raise questions for adults under 65 Federal data highlights the heightened risks of the coronavirus for adults 65 and older. Since the start of the pandemic, about 77 percent of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in adults 65 and older, data from the CDC shows, and hospitalization rates for this age group are much higher than those for younger populations. Still, roughly 17 percent of COVID deaths have occurred in adults ages 50 to 64, and about 5.5 percent in people ages 30 to 49. Robert H. Hopkins Jr., M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, says the changes could “raise, potentially, additional concerns in the health care professional community about the value of vaccinating people at all who are under 65, if they don't have major health conditions.” What’s more, Hopkins adds, the framework excludes people who want to get the vaccine to reduce their risk of long COVID, which affects more than 20 million Americans. According to the CDC, research shows that COVID vaccination is the best way to prevent long COVID, including in children. “There’s an implication that [the vaccine] is not effective, and we know it’s effective,” says Rebecca Wurtz, M.D., an infectious disease physician and a professor in health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. According to a CDC study, the vaccines averted approximately 68,000 hospitalizations during the 2023–2024 respiratory virus season. Wurtz says the shift could also put more responsibility on patients under 65 to familiarize themselves with all the conditions that can increase their risk of severe illness and communicate those conditions to their doctor, especially since it’s unlikely clinical trial data will be available in time for the fall vaccine season. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “The risk factors [outlined by the CDC] are conditions that many people ages 50 to 65 share,” Wurtz says, pointing to obesity as one and trouble hearing as another. Federal research shows that 28 percent of adults 50 and older are physically inactive — another key risk factor for severe COVID-19. Another concern among some doctors: The change proposed in the New England Journal of Medicine article ignores young children, who are not immune to the effects of COVID-19. According to an analysis of data from the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 234,000 children under age 18 were hospitalized with COVID-19 from the fall of 2020 to the spring of 2024. And children ages 0-4 accounted for 58 percent of the confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions from January 2022 to April 2024, the same analysis found. “We’re not talking about and thinking about that relationship between, you know, teachers and health care providers and grandparents getting COVID and transmitting it to their non-immune grandchildren or patients or students,” Wurtz says. CDC data shows that about 13 percent of U.S. children under the age of 18 got the COVID-19 vaccine in the 2024-2025 respiratory illness season. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Reducing your COVID risk It’s unclear when any outlined changes will take effect. In the meantime, Wurtz says, adults 65 and older who are concerned about getting sick from the virus this summer can get a spring booster, as recommended by the CDC. Individuals who are moderately or severely immunocompromised are also eligible for a spring shot. “We know that immunity wanes over the space of four to six months. And we also know that COVID is a year-round condition, not an influenza-patterned condition,” Wurtz says. “[The vaccine] is safe, it’s effective, it’s covered by insurance, and it’s available at drugstores. And I think people [65 and older] should be reminded to get that booster.” For people under 65 who are not eligible for a spring shot, washing hands often and cleaning frequently touched surfaces can help reduce the risk of getting sick. Opting for outdoor activities over indoor ones and wearing a high-quality mask in public indoor areas can also help. “We have to recognize that COVID-19 is still here with us,” Hopkins says. “It’s still causing thousands of deaths a year. It’s causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations a year. Those numbers are less each year as we come through the pandemic, but as long as the virus continues to circulate, we’re still going to generate new variants.” Editor's note: This story, first published May 21, 2025, has been updated to reflect new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-ckm-syndrome/,"A Common Health Disorder You’ve Probably Never Heard Of What older adults need to know about the newly defined cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome By Michael Schroeder, AARP Comments En español Published June 13, 2024 AARP (Source: Shutterstock (2)) Even if they seem relatively distant in their positions in our bodies and autonomous in their roles, our organs are intimately, intricately connected. The gut talks to the brain; the liver can affect the lungs; and the health of your heart can influence the health of your kidneys. In fact, these last two — the heart and kidneys — are so closely intertwined that health experts have coined a new term to define patients who are at risk for their related illnesses. It’s called cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, and research suggests it’s exceptionally common. The American Heart Association says 1 in 3 U.S. adults have three or more risk factors for CKM syndrome, and it appears most adults are affected to some degree. In fact, a recent study published in the journal JAMA suggests nearly 90 percent of U.S. adults have some stage of CKM syndrome — a reflection of risk factors from being overweight to having chronic conditions like diabetes. What is cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome? Most people are familiar with heart disease, kidney disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. These four health conditions are among the most common in the U.S., and they are especially prevalent in older adults. Are You at Risk? To help people understand where they are on the CKM health risk spectrum specifically for heart disease, the AHA has a calculator. You plug in your sex, age, cholesterol, blood pressure﻿, body mass index (BMI) and a few other details, and the tool spits out your estimated 10- and 30-year percentage risk for developing cardiovascular disease or heart failure. But they’re also closely connected, and CKM syndrome — a concept recognized and a term first coined in an advisory by the American Heart Association last fall — encompasses their overlap. To put it another way: If you have a metabolic disorder (metabolic just has to do with getting energy from food) like type 2 diabetes or obesity, your risk goes up for either developing heart and kidney problems, or worsening them. Chiadi Ndumele, an associate professor of medicine and director of obesity and cardiometabolic research at Johns Hopkins University, says CKM syndrome is “a really potent driver” of premature deaths, including from heart disease. Cardiovascular deaths — once on the decline — are now increasing, evidence suggests. “This is thought to be all secondary to CKM syndrome,” says Ndumele, who coauthored the AHA advisory. The snowball effect The causes and effects of CKM syndrome are wide-ranging. It’s not a simple flowchart but more of a spiraling storm — such as when obesity, a major cause of kidney disease, leads to a cascade of metabolic issues. “When a kidney is damaged, by diabetes per se, or hypertension in particular, it produces a number of other abnormalities that affect the whole body — particularly the cardiovascular system,” says﻿ Katherine Tuttle, , professor of medicine in the division of nephrology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and a coauthor of the AHA advisory. “It causes inflammation, it raises blood pressure, it makes people more resistant to insulin, it makes the lipid disorders worse.” Are You at Risk? To help people understand where they are on the CKM health risk spectrum specifically for heart disease, the AHA has a calculator. You plug in your sex, age, cholesterol, blood pressure﻿, body mass index (BMI) and a few other details, and the tool spits out your estimated 10- and 30-year percentage risk for developing cardiovascular disease or heart failure. In turn, already high cholesterol levels can rise further; increasing insulin resistance inhibits the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar; and other changes take place — like kidney-disease-related calcium buildup in arteries\. Taken together, all these factors make circulation problems worse, which Tuttle says accelerates atherosclerosis, involving hardening and narrowing of the arteries, and heart failure. “These risk factors and diseases come in clusters,” echoes Rahul Aggarwal, a cardiovascular fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who conducted the analysis for the JAMA research on the prevalence of CKM syndrome. “So if you start developing one, you’re at more risk of developing others. But they also improve in clusters as well.” Lose weight or address an issue like high blood pressure with medication, and experts emphasize you could see health improvements that are wide-ranging. The CKM syndrome spectrum The JAMA study analyzed a pool of 10,762 adults ages 20 and older from across the country. The researchers sorted these adults by their stage of CKM syndrome risk based on AHA criteria and found: Stage 0: 10.6 percent had no CKM risk factors.Stage 1: 25.9 percent were assigned to the lowest level of CKM risk (besides not having it). This stage includes people who are overweight or who have obesity, who carry extra weight around their midsection, or who have higher than normal blood sugar levels.Stage 2: 49 percent of participants were classified as stage 2. These individuals met stage 1 criteria and also had metabolic risk factors, such as high triglycerides or blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.Stage 3: 5.4 percent were considered to be at stage 3. These individuals met stage 1 and 2 criteria, plus they had some early “subclinical” signs of cardiovascular disease, such as calcium buildup detected in the arteries.Stage 4: 9.2 percent were considered to be at stage 4. This is the highest level of CKM risk that includes stage 1, 2 and 3 risk factors, plus cardiovascular disease, which could be anything from arrhythmia to heart failure. “CKM syndrome occurs along a spectrum,” Ndumele says. What’s more, several nonmedical risk factors can influence where you fall on that spectrum, including economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, and where a person lives and works. Reversing CKM syndrome If you find yourself on the CKM spectrum, it’s important to know that you are not destined to move to higher stages, or even to stay where you are, Aggarwal says. For people who have some risk factors but don’t yet have heart or kidney disease, one of the biggest things is incorporating lifestyle changes, Aggarwal says, like exercising 150 minutes a week. That can help with losing weight and managing or preventing chronic conditions like diabetes.﻿ For those who do have more advanced risks related to everything from diabetes to high cholesterol, experts recommend talking to your doctor about whether medications could help, in addition to lifestyle changes. For example, there are medications that can help manage high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol, and treating these individual conditions can lower your risk for other related issues. There are also medications that can help people lose weight, and research suggests these drugs may also affect heart and kidney problems. A recent study evaluated the effect of semaglutide (the active ingredient in the diabetes medication Ozempic and the weight loss medication Wegovy) in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May, the study found the medication had significant benefits not only for addressing kidney disease but also for preventing cardiovascular deaths. “Kidney disease is probably one of the one of the strongest — if not the strongest — risk factors for cardiovascular disease,” says Tuttle, who was involved in the study. “If you can restore kidney health, then you have the opportunity for everything else to get better too.” Michael Schroeder is a freelance health writer and editor who's covered everything from chronic disease and mental health to medication side effects. His stories have been published in a range of print and digital publications, including Time, U.S. News & World Report, The Washington Post, and Psychology Today.","The article discusses the newly defined cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a condition that encompasses the interconnectedness of heart, kidney, and metabolic health.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/foods-high-in-omega-fatty-acids/,"15 Foods High in Omega Fatty Acids How to work this top nutrient into your diet for a longer, healthier life By Alexa Pellegrini, AARP Comments En español Published November 07, 2023 littleartvector / Getty Images If there’s one class of nutrients that packs a punch against unhealthy aging, it’s omega fatty acids — particularly omega-3s. This nutrition superstar can help prevent heart disease and stroke and may even lower the risk of dementia. Even though the nutrient is important to have in our diet as we age, experts say most older adults aren’t getting enough.​​ “Nine out of 10 Americans are deficient in omega-3s,” says James O’Keefe, M.D., cardiologist and medical director of the Charles and Barbara Duboc Cardio Health & Wellness Center at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri. “Across the board, consuming more of these nutrients is likely to reduce the risk of premature death.”​ ​ What are omega-3 fatty acids? ​As a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid, omega-3s are essential for every facet of wellness later in life. They deliver alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to the body, helping to reduce inflammation associated with chronic and acute illnesses.​​ One study in the American Heart Association journal Stroke shows that consuming more DHA is associated with a lower risk of stroke, a leading cause of cardiovascular death. Another study, in Current Clinical Pharmacology, found that EPA and DHA boost the body’s nerve growth factor level, a key element to preventing Alzheimer’s. Omega-3s may even help preserve our hearing, according to the Fatty Acid Research Institute.​ But the average American adult consumes only 115 milligrams of EPA and DHA a day, according to O’Keefe; by comparison, the average Japanese adult consumes 1,300 milligrams of EPA and DHA per day. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that Japan is home to just one of five global “blue zones” and has the highest life expectancy in the world: 84.3 years, according to the World Health Organization. A diet high in omega fatty acids isn’t the only reason people in Japan tend to live long and healthy lives, but experts say it is likely one of them.​ O’Keefe suggests getting at least 1,000 milligrams per day and to favor EPA and DHA, if possible. Here are a few delicious foods high in omega-3s.​ ​Sardines (2 grams of EPA and DHA per 3-ounce serving)​. Don’t be intimidated by tinned fish. “Canned food, if properly handled and reserved, is a very good source of omega-3 as well as protein,” says Artemis Simopoulos, M.D., founder and president of the Center for Genetics, Nutrition and Health and author of The Healthiest Diet for You: Scientific Aspects. Eat them right out of the tin, toss them with salad or add them to grain-free crackers (the bones are edible).​ ​ Herring (1.5 grams of EPA and DHA per 3-ounce serving). Savory and perfectly mild, fresh and canned herring also contains less mercury than other fish. It can be boiled, sautéed, baked or pickled.​ ​ Atlantic salmon (2.4 grams of EPA and DHA per 6-ounce serving)​. In one study, eating this versatile fish twice weekly helped lower serum triglyceride levels, which is one key to a strong heart.​ ​ Flaxseed (1.8 grams of ALA per tablespoon)​. These seeds are the perfect high-fiber addition to smoothies, salads and other vegetarian dishes. Along with a healthy dose of ALA, you get the fiber you need to stay regular.​​ Chia seeds (5 grams of ALA per 1-ounce serving). Mix them into sweet and savory dishes to get every essential amino acid you need for better nutrition. Research also shows chia seeds may help improve glucose tolerance and metabolism.​​ The importance of the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio ​Eating your way to longevity doesn’t mean overloading on omega-3s. In fact, they work better when balanced with a proper intake of omega-6s.​ ​Omega-6s are essential polyunsaturated fatty acids that deliver linoleic acid (LA) to the body. They’re also more abundant that the other types of omega fatty acids, and that can be a problem. “Because of the way our food supply continues to be, there is no way you will ever be deficient in omega-6s. They’re everywhere,” Simopoulos explains.​ ​Most older adults on a Western diet eat too many omega-6s compared to omega-3s. In their unhealthiest form, omega-6s are found in fried foods and foods that come in bags and boxes.​ ​ An imbalanced omega-3 to omega-6 ratio often leads to weight gain. “Omega-6 fatty acids increase the size of the fat cell, the number of fat cells and appetite,” Simopoulos says. “That’s why many people find they lose more weight eating omega-3-rich meals found in the Mediterranean diet.”​ Peter Dazeley / Getty Images Who Should Take Fish Oil? Many studies have found that eating fresh food is better than taking supplements, but if fresh fish is too expensive or if you don’t like the taste, consider fish oil. A study in the Mediterranean Journal of Rheumatology found that fish oil may ease aches and pains associated with rheumatoid arthritis and reduce inflammation. For concerns about cognitive decline, joint problems and high triglycerides, O’Keefe suggests fish oil that delivers 1,500 mg to 2,000 mg of EPA and DHA per day. ​ ​However, O’Keefe recommends that older adults with atrial fibrillation — an irregular heartbeat — take no more than 600 to 700 milligrams of EPA and DHA per day. “If you start taking high doses of EPA and DHA — around 3,000 to 4,000 milligrams per day — your risk of A-fib goes up as much as 15 percent,” he says.​ ​Before you take fish oil, smell it to make sure it isn’t rancid. And always keep fish oil liquids refrigerated.​ ​According to Simopoulos, people should aim for an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 4:1. That means getting enough EPA and DHA in your diet and opting for healthier sources of omega-6s, like these:​ ​ Sunflower seeds (10.6 grams of LA per 1/4 cup). ​Sunflower seeds are not only full of healthy fats, but research suggests that they can help regulate blood pressure. Mix one tablespoon into salads or trail mix.​ ​Peanut butter (1.9 grams of LA per tablespoon). Peanut butter is rich in nutrients we sometimes lack as we get older, including iron. Opt for brands made without artificial sweeteners or added sugars.​ ​ Egg yolks (1.8 grams of LA per large egg)​. Eggs are packed with vitamin D and other key anti-aging nutrients. Most older adults with normal cholesterol levels can eat up to two per day.​ ​ Cashews (2.6 grams of LA per ounce)​. Cashews can satisfy our cravings for crunchy, salty snacks. As a bonus, they’re also rich in the omega-3 fatty acid ALA and high in protein.​ ​Tofu (3 grams of LA per 1/2 cup)​. With a mild, nutty flavor, tofu pairs well with many dishes. Science also shows that eating the soybeans in tofu may ease hot flashes.​​ Peter Dazeley / Getty Images Who Should Take Fish Oil?

And always keep fish oil liquids refrigerated.​ What about omega-9 fatty acids? Along with omega-3s and omega-6s, there’s one other important and often overlooked source of omega fatty acids: omega-9s. While they aren’t considered essential, they’re the major source of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) expressed mainly as oleic acid (OA). They offer several health benefits.​ ​Here are a few omega-9-rich foods packed with anti-aging properties.​ ​ Alberto Pomares / Getty Images Choosing the Best Olive Oil Not all olive oils are made equal. For an olive oil high in omega-9 fatty acids and polyphenols — one of the best sources of antioxidants for aging, O’Keefe offers this tip: “If you cleanse your mouth with a little water and then taste a half-teaspoon of olive oil, in about 15 to 20 seconds you should feel a black pepper-like sting at the back of your throat. The more intense the burn, the higher the polyphenols.”​ Olive oil (10.2 grams of MUFAs per tablespoon)​. Reach for extra virgin olive oil; it has the highest level of polyphenols. These powerful compounds may help protect you against cancer, diabetes and dementia.​ ​ Almonds (9 grams of MUFAs in 23 nuts). ​Swap processed snacks for a small handful of these high-fiber nuts. Almonds may even help lower bad cholesterol — pair them with dark chocolate for a healthy treat. Hazelnuts (6.4 grams of MUFAs in 10 nuts)​. Slightly sweet and toasty, hazelnuts can help satisfy your chocolate cravings. They’re also high in magnesium, an electrolyte that nourishes the heart. ​Walnuts (9 grams of MUFAs per 3/4 cup)​. These delicious nuts are perfect for toasting and adding to salads or yogurt or eating by the handful (just not too many if you are watching your weight, because they are high in calories). According to the American Heart Association, eating walnuts every day could reduce the risk of heart attack.​​ Avocados (14.7 grams of MUFAs per cup)​. Avocado toast might seem trendy, but the benefits stack up. A study in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that eating avocados may lower the odds of death from heart disease.

Declining trends, however, shouldn’t be mistaken for lax precautions. Doctors and virus experts say it’s just about time for older adults to roll up their sleeves for another dose of the coronavirus vaccine. In October 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a recommendation that people ages 65 and older get a spring shot of the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine to boost their immune systems and restore protection that has waned since the fall, when the updated vaccines became available. Immunocompromised individuals — those who have cancer or take certain medications to treat an autoimmune disorder, for example — are also advised to get another COVID vaccine. “Those two groups are the ones that are now consistently making up the population that’s suffering from severe COVID-19, meaning emergency room visits or hospitalizations,” says Andrew Pekosz, a professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. In early January, the COVID hospitalization rate for adults younger than 50 was 1.0 per 100,000 people; for those 65-plus, it was 18.3 per 100,000. And during last year’s respiratory illness season, adults 65 and older accounted for 70 percent of all COVID-related hospitalizations. Why do older adults need a boost? A big reason has to do with age-related changes that make it more difficult for older adults to fight off an infection, explains Rachel M. Presti, M.D., a professor of medicine and medical director of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Unit at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. This is not unique to COVID-19. Older adults are more susceptible to severe illness from other bugs, such as influenza, which is why a high-dose version of the flu shot is recommended for people 65-plus. Additionally, the COVID vaccines “provide really pretty good protection in the short term, but by the time you get to month four, five and six, that protection begins to wane,” William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told AARP. And, unlike flu, which typically strikes during the fall and winter, COVID-19 is active year-round, which is why it has surged in the summer months. “So this six-month boost is meant to sort of kick that [immunity] back up to high levels of protection until the following fall,” Pekosz says, when people are typically vaccinated for flu and COVID-19. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. When should you get the COVID-19 vaccine? The recommendation from the CDC is for people age 65-plus to get the COVID-19 vaccine six months after their last dose. So, if you were vaccinated in September or October, you’re just about due for another. If you waited on the vaccine in the fall and got it more recently, however, you can still get another dose this spring. While the CDC advises a six-month stretch between the two shots, the agency says the minimum time is two months apart, “which allows flexibility to get the second dose prior to typical COVID-19 surges, travel, life events and health care visits.” Three different COVID-19 vaccines are available at pharmacies and health clinics, including an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech and a protein-based vaccine from Novavax. Less than a quarter of U.S. adults (about 23 percent) received the latest COVID-19 vaccine as of Feb. 22, federal data shows; an estimated 25 percent of adults 65 and older had received the shot as of November 2024, according to Medicare data. How effective is the COVID vaccine? The strains of coronavirus currently circulating have drifted from the variant the vaccines target. “But there have been a number of studies that show that the vaccine still does induce what we call cross-reactive antibodies and that it will recognize the currently circulating variants,” Pekosz says. “So it looks like it’s still effective,” Presti adds. Getting the vaccine this spring doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t catch COVID-19, but it does reduce the risk that you’ll experience severe illness if you get infected. “Thousands of people died of COVID-19 [in the past year], and the vast majority of them either haven’t been vaccinated or haven’t been vaccinated recently. So there certainly still is data that says that the vaccine is a safe and effective way to minimize severe disease,” Pekosz says. The COVID-19 vaccine can also help prevent the spread of the illness, Presti points out. “And that’s part of why vaccines are so effective,” she says. “It’s not just to protect you; it’s really to protect everyone around you as well because then, even if you get infected, you won’t transmit as much to other people, because you won’t be producing as much virus because your immune system will be able to clear it.” Heading into spring, it’s “still useful” to think of other ways to lower your chances of getting COVID-19, Presti adds. Wash your hands often, she says, and consider keeping a mask handy in case you’re out in public and people around you are coughing or sneezing. “It’s still a very legitimate way to protect yourself, in addition to getting the vaccine,” she says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fda-approves-novavax-vaccine/,"Third COVID Vaccine Gets Approved for Adults 65 and Over Novavax shot also cleared for people ages 12 to 64 with underlying health conditions By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published May 19, 2025 AARP (Sipa via AP Images, Getty Images) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially approved a COVID-19 vaccine from Novavax for adults 65 and older and for individuals ages 12 to 64﻿ who have an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk for serious illness from a coronavirus infection. The vaccine, Nuvaxovid, is the third coronavirus shot to gain full approval, joining vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. It has been available under emergency use authorization for people 12 and older since 2022. Unlike the other two FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines, however, Nuvaxovid’s approval is limited to older adults and some people at higher risk for severe illness. Both Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines are approved for people 12 and older and are available under emergency use authorization for kids as young as 6 months old. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “Market research and U.S. CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] statistics indicate that older individuals and those with underlying conditions are the populations most likely to seek out COVID-19 vaccination seasonally,” Novavax President and Chief Executive Officer John C. Jacobs said in a statement. “This significant milestone demonstrates our commitment to these populations and is a significant step towards availability of our protein-based vaccine option."" According to federal data, older adults represent 94 percent of all COVID-19 deaths. And while hospitalizations are lower now than they were during peak periods, the hospitalization rate for adults 65 and older towers over the rates for younger populations. How Nuvaxovid differs from mRNA vaccines Novavax’s vaccine is based on a more traditional platform than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are. It’s a protein subunit vaccine, meaning it contains harmless copies of the COVID-19 spike protein and trains the immune system to recognize and attack this protein. Doctors have seen it as an alternative for people who remain skeptical about the mRNA vaccines or who may be allergic to them. The FDA approval did not specify what health conditions make someone age 12 to 64 eligible for Nuvaxovid. But according to the CDC, more than 20 categories of conditions, such as chronic lung disease, cancer and heart issues, can increase a person’s risk for severe illness from a coronavirus infection. ﻿ The FDA is requiring Novavax to conduct post-marketing trials to continue studying the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness. Novavax says it expects to be ready for the commercial delivery of the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine formula in the U.S. this fall, pending vaccine strain recommendations from FDA advisers. A meeting to discuss updates to the COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for May 22. A group of vaccine experts that advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations is scheduled to meet in late June.

All the body negatives that we associate with midlife — an expanding midsection, softer muscles, general physical decline — aren’t inevitable. They’re avoidable, and even reversible. Join the AARP Weight Loss After 50 Challenge Learn what small changes you can make for health and wellness as we age. Step by step, we'll: Show you the secrets to losing weight Give you guides to healthy foods Provide dozens of delicious new recipes to try Help you embrace a whole new way of eating Get Started Yet the vast majority of us struggle with weight gain in middle age. The standard weight-loss tricks that worked earlier in life no longer keep the weight off. We may be eating healthfully and exercising just as much, but we still gain weight. Why? As the health editor for AARP The Magazine, I was tasked with solving this puzzle. After months of digging into up-to-the-minute weight-loss science (with a focus on research conducted on people our age), I created a program to halt midlife weight gain and muscle loss, and tested it on more than 100 volunteers. The result: Our test panelists lost as much as 22 pounds in just 12 weeks. And now that research has been collected in The Whole Body Reset, a diet program made specifically for people at midlife and beyond. The answer to later-life weight gain largely lies in protein timing — eating protein in the proper amounts throughout the day. This triggers older bodies to spurn fat gain and hold on to lean muscle tissue. This approach, coupled with plenty of vitamins and minerals, fiber, and healthy fats, can help older people not only reshape their bodies but reshape their lives.​ This eating program isn’t low-carb or low-fat, doesn’t require calorie counting or periods of food restriction, and doesn’t eliminate any particular food category. But once you know how to do it and incorporate it into your daily life, it can stop, and even reverse, age-related weight gain and muscle loss. It can even significantly reduce your risk of many of the chronic diseases of aging, enhancing the overall health of both your body and your brain.​ What makes this plan different Traditional weight-loss diets trigger our bodies to grow fatter in three ways. By restricting calories, a traditional diet sends the message that your body needs to be prepared to live through times of famine. Once your body receives that signal, it turns down your resting metabolism — the number of calories your body burns while you’re binge-watching TV shows, sleeping or sitting at the computer. So what you’ve done in reality is reduce the number of calories your body burns every day, setting yourself up for future weight gain.​ When we go on a diet, we don’t just lose fat. Most of us lose muscle, too, and muscle burns more calories than fat. Once we’re into our mid-40s or so, muscle loss is already a problem we must battle daily. Because muscle plays a huge role in preventing belly fat, the more muscle we lose, the more belly fat we’ll gain.​ Perhaps more important, most diets are not built for people in midlife or beyond. Our bodies are different now — with rising protein needs and a reduced ability to extract nutrients from food. And we don’t eat enough fiber.​​ Join the AARP Weight Loss After 50 Challenge Learn what small changes you can make for health and wellness as we age. Step by step, we'll: Show you the secrets to losing weight Give you guides to healthy foods Provide dozens of delicious new recipes to try Help you embrace a whole new way of eating Get Started Resetting the older body Studies show that individuals who increase their protein intake to 25-30 grams per meal could slow the descent into muscle loss and weight gain. When we do, researchers say, our bodies respond to exercise as though we were decades younger. (Before starting any new diet and exercise regime, be sure to check with your medical professional.) What's in the Book? ​ The Whole Body Reset includes:​ Scores of recipes and snack suggestions A guide to dining out A 10-day jump-start plan A fitness plan that requires no equipment​ This isn’t a controversial point or some sort of far-out idea, by the way. It’s consistent with the findings of the Prot-Age Study Group, an association of gerontologists and nutritionists. Its study reaffirmed that older people should eat about 1 to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day — or roughly 0.5 to 0.6 grams per pound. But it also concluded that 25 to 30 grams of protein per meal was crucial for older people to reach their anabolic threshold — the point at which muscle mass can be maintained. But don’t get the idea that this is some sort of high-protein diet. The average person following this plan won’t eat much more protein — if any more — on a given day than he or she does already. But what will happen is that the timing and concentration of that protein is going to change The only thing you really need to do on the The Whole Body Reset plan is to make sure you hit certain protein and fiber numbers while eating healthy food. The secret behind this program is to identify the nutrients your body needs more of and find simple, delicious ways to fit more of them into your day. PAUL SIRISALEE Eat 25 to 30 grams of quality protein at each meal The typical American diet looks like a tiny bit of protein at breakfast (milk in your cereal, maybe an egg or two), a bit more at lunch (a turkey sandwich, perhaps) and then a huge infusion of protein (a steak or a couple of pork chops) at dinner. All told, we may consume an average of about 90 grams of protein a day, which is roughly what we need. But about two-thirds of that typically comes at dinnertime. Our bodies need 25 to 30 grams of protein — generally 25 grams for women, 30 for men — at each meal to keep the process of protein biosynthesis cranking along. Overeating protein at dinner doesn’t help; our bodies may only be able to use about 30 grams of protein at a time when at rest.​​ Top foods: Fish and shellfish, eggs (in mod­eration), poultry, lean meat, combinations of grains and legumes that supply complete proteins, and protein shakes​​. PAUL SIRISALEE Enjoy fortified dairy foods 2 to 3 times a day​​ Yes, you would like cheese on that. And whipped cream? Go for it. As a complete protein source, dairy is hard to beat. And as we age, the benefits of milk, cheese, yogurt and other forms of dairy only multiply. ​​That’s due in part to dairy’s protein punch — it’s particularly high in an essential muscle-building compound called leucine. But dairy delivers many other nutrients, particularly calcium, magnesium and vitamin D — all nutrients that our bodies have difficulty absorbing from food as we age, and all of which help to keep us healthy and strong. In one study of older women, consumption of more milk, yogurt and cheese was associated with greater muscle mass as well as greater grip strength.​​ Top foods: Milk, yogurt and kefir fortified with vitamin D, cheese, cottage cheese and whey-based protein smoothies​​ What's in the Book? ​ The Whole Body Reset includes:​ Scores of recipes and snack suggestions A guide to dining out A 10-day jump-start plan A fitness plan that requires no equipment​ PAUL SIRISALEE PAUL SIRISALEE Eat colorful fruits and vegetables at meals and snacks​​ Oh, sure, you knew this part was coming, right? But for good reason: Any diet plan that doesn’t include heaping portions of produce should immediately be filed away as a snake-oil cure. While all vegetables are good for you — assuming they’re not coated with breading or deep-fried in oil — it helps to think of dark, leafy greens as the alpha veggies. Each day should include at least one helping — a small side salad or a half-cup serving of cooked green vegetables — ensuring that you have a dietary source of the B vitamin folate. Folate also plays a crucial role in battling dementia, hearing loss and depression in mature adults. In a study of postmenopausal women, those who were overweight averaged 12 percent less folate in their blood than normal-weight women; those who were obese had 22 percent less.​​ Top foods: All colorful vegetables and fruits, but especially dark, leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, kale), cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, arugula, cabbage, collards, watercress), red and orange vegetables (carrots, squash, red peppers, tomatoes), berries, tree fruits (apples, pears, cherries) and citrus (oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes) ​​Aim for at least 5 grams of fiber at each meal PAUL SIRISALEE Chances are, you don’t eat enough fiber. In fact, the average American eats about 15 grams of fiber a day — that’s about the amount you’d find in any of these:​​ a cup of black beans​two cups of bran flakesthree oat bran muffinsfive bananas10 carrots13 cups of popcorn ​​And that’s only about half of what experts believe we need to eat daily to ensure good health and a leaner, fitter body. One study looked at the dietary habits of middle-aged women; when the researchers followed up 20 months later, they found that every additional gram of fiber the subjects ate correlated with a half-pound less in total weight and a quarter-percent less fat.​​ Top foods: Whole wheat pasta, bread, tortillas and crackers; oats; brown rice; beans; vegetables such as potatoes (with the skins on), brussels sprouts, peas, broccoli and corn; and fruits​​ Enjoy more healthy fats PAUL SIRISALEE ​​If you’ve been trying to lose weight by eating less fat, we have a word of advice: Stop. In fact, there are three types of healthy fats you should be enjoying more of.​ ​Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats — found in salmon, mackerel, sardines and tuna — have been shown to play a role in reducing belly fat and in promoting muscle preservation in older adults. Fruit and nut oils. Olive oil is the go-to here. Studies have shown that extra-virgin olive oil may reduce dementia risk by flushing out the proteins that gum up communications channels between brain cells.​​ Dairy fats. Full-fat dairy has been linked to a reduced risk of obesity. That may be partly because satisfying creamy fats reduce the desire to snack later on. ​​Top foods: Seafood, oils (olive, safflower, peanut, sesame), nuts, seeds, avocado and olives​​ Don’t drink your calories (or chemicals) ​​A significant source of empty calories is beverages. Soda, sweetened iced teas, specialty coffee drinks, sports drinks, oversize smoothies and shakes, even fruit juices can be loaded with sugar.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/diabetes-medication-for-weight-loss-risks/,"Should You Take a Diabetes Drug for Weight Loss? The medications can help many patients improve their health, but they come with some risks Malte Mueller / Getty Images By Rachel Nania, AARP En español Published March 16, 2023 It’s hard to read the headlines or watch TV these days without seeing an article or ad praising the weight-loss wonders of Ozempic. The injectable drug, whose technical name is semaglutide, first gained federal approval in 2017 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, a condition that affects more than 35 million Americans. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved a version of semaglutide with a slightly higher dose and a different name (Wegovy) as a treatment for obesity. However, more and more people who don’t have diabetes or obesity are turning to the semaglutide drugs for their slimming effects. People taking semaglutide lose, on average, 15 percent of their body weight, studies show. Some shed even more. But health experts warn that semaglutide and other drugs like it shouldn’t be used as a quick fix for weight loss in people who don’t need or qualify for it. Besides potential health risks, their increasing use may be contributing to the drugs’ shortage. Both Ozempic and Wegovy are on the FDA’s list of medications in short supply, along with a similar type 2 diabetes drug, tirzepatide (Mounjaro), which in clinical trials also helped people lose a significant amount of weight. Taking these drugs to lose weight could set you up for some unpleasant side effects, not to mention a blow to your bank account. Semaglutide is expensive (upwards of $1,000 a month), and insurance coverage is hit or miss, even for people who meet the FDA’s criteria. Many Medicare Part D plans will cover Ozempic for its intended use in type 2 diabetics, but Medicare does not cover medications just to treat obesity. What is semaglutide? Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists that have been around since 2005 but “keep getting better and more powerful,” says Brian Burtch, M.D., an endocrinologist with University Hospitals in Mentor, Ohio. These drugs work by helping the pancreas release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high. They also slow digestion, causing you to feel fuller faster, and help the brain control hunger and cravings, explains Dina Hafez Griauzde, M.D., an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School and an internist at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System. “So for a diabetes medication, [GLP-1 receptor agonists] are outstanding because they allow us to aggressively control blood sugar, not have to worry about low blood sugars, and allow our patients to lose weight,” Burtch says. Studies show that the vast majority of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity. Other well-known type 2 diabetes drugs in the GLP-1 category include dulaglutide (Trulicity) and liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda). These have also been shown to help people lose weight. Who can benefit from semaglutide? Semaglutide can be a powerful tool for overweight adults. Losing just 5 percent of your body weight can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic health issues, Griauzde says. “And we know greater weight loss correlates with greater health improvements,” she adds. Dropping 10 to 15 percent of your body weight can improve one’s liver function and reduce sleep apnea, for example. Only adults with type 2 diabetes are eligible for Ozempic, based on the FDA’s approval. Wegovy was approved for people with a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or greater and for people with a BMI of 27 or higher who also have at least one weight-related health issue, like high blood pressure or cholesterol. If this is you and you’ve been struggling to lose weight, talk to your doctor about your options, Griauzde recommends. You’ll also want to check with your health plan to see what’s covered and for how long. If semaglutide doesn’t make the cut, Griauzde says there are older weight-loss medications that can be just as effective for some patients. What about people who don’t have diabetes or obesity? Physicians can prescribe FDA-approved medications for uses not spelled out by the agency. When they do, it’s called ﻿“off-label﻿” prescribing, and according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, about ﻿o﻿n﻿e in five prescriptions written today are for off-label use. But when it comes to semaglutide, Griauzde says there’s really no indication for its use in people who don’t have type 2 diabetes and who don’t have excess weight. For one thing, health experts stress that the weekly injections are not meant to be a quick fix for somebody looking to drop a few pounds. “This is something that you commit to long term,” Burtch says, the same way you would commit to a medication used to treat another chronic health issue. Stopping the medication will cause you to regain the weight you lost. Semaglutide can also cause some unpleasant — sometimes serious — side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, stomach pain, headache, fatigue and more. “Typically, those let up as you’ve been on the medication and your body gets used to it, but not in all instances,” Burtch says. In rarer cases, taking these drugs may increase the risk of pancreatitis, and their labels warn about the potential risk of thyroid C-cell tumors, so they’re not recommended for people who have a personal family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or of what’s called MEN, which stands for multiple endocrine neoplasia, Burtch says. “We hope that patients consult with a doctor who’s either an endocrinologist or an obesity expert who is familiar with the risks and benefits of these medications﻿, and how to use them properly,” Burtch says. “Because we do see patients who are just trying to lose a little bit of weight, who are already at a reasonable weight, just wanting to get skinnier, and that is not who these medicines are made for. These medicines are made for patients who have [excess] weight, who have other metabolic risk factors, and by losing this weight will improve their health.”​​ Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 clear sentences:

That was the conclusion of a 2024 analysis in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, which reviewed research articles published over the past several years that explored the benefits of exercise for people with PD. Before You Get Started… Make sure your doctor approves of your new exercise program Ask your doctor how to time exercise around your medication doses Get an evaluation from a physical therapist who specializes in PD When looking for classes or a personal trainer, try to find options tailored to people with PD Aim to eventually meet the Parkinson’s Foundation exercise guidelines Don’t overdo it.

To find a Parkinson’s-friendly exercise program near you, contact the Parkinson’s Foundation Helpline at Helpline@parkinson.org or 1-800-4PD-INFO (1-800-473-4636). While there’s far more published research on the effects of vigorous physical activity in mice bred to have PD symptoms, the existing evidence on the benefits of exercise in people with the disease is very promising. “Exercise has multiple clinical benefits in Parkinson’s disease,” says exercise physiologist Martin Langeskov-Christensen, associate professor in the department of clinical medicine at Aarhus University in Denmark and an author of the 2024 analysis. “It actually addresses both motor and non-motor symptoms.” Motor symptoms are related to movement, like walking and keeping your balance. Non-motor symptoms can include depression, anxiety, sleep troubles and cognitive problems. In one study included in his team’s analysis, researchers followed 237 people with early PD for an average of five years. Those who maintained regular levels of physical activity over that time saw a slower decline in their ability to perform activities of daily life. Physical activity “can improve coordination, balance, gait and even reduce the risk of falls,” Langeskov-Christensen says. Some of these symptoms, like impaired balance, can be difficult to fully treat with Parkinson’s medications, his research concludes. Keeping your body moving might improve or stabilize motor symptoms like walking and balance problems. You’ve probably also heard — or even experienced firsthand — how exercise can improve problems unrelated to movement, including low mood, fatigue, sleep troubles and constipation. “People will complain of abdominal pain from slowed gastric motility, and the first thing we say is, ‘Exercise,’ ” says Rebecca Gilbert, M.D., chief mission officer, American Parkinson’s Disease Association. After a meal, “take a walk around the block, get everything moving,” she recommends. But exercise does more than just improve specific PD symptoms. When it’s part of your regular routine, it can keep you functioning well and improve your overall quality of life.

Intense exercise may enhance brain circuitry There’s some evidence that increased exercise in people who have Parkinson’s may interfere with the underlying disease processes that cause these symptoms. Though the research is still in the early stages, there are some positive signs that exercise affects neuroplasticity. Simply put, neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change and adapt in response to learning, experiences or injury. That means that even in the face of a disease that is killing cells in the brain, the brain can still change in response to the positive effects of exercise. Parkinson’s disease involves a loss of the brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that is critical to movement and mood, among other functions. “There are a few studies, using PET scans of the brain, that show that after six months of aerobic exercise, dopamine levels increase in the brain,” Langeskov-Christensen says. One small study, published in npj Parkinson’s Disease in 2024, found that high-intensity exercise might slow the neurodegeneration that PD causes. In the study, 10 people with mild and early PD participated in the Beat Parkinson’s Today exercise program, which involved high-intensity workouts, including cardio and strength training at least three times a week for six months. Participants wore heart monitors to ensure their hearts were beating at around 80 percent of the max capacity for their age. Signs that you’re pushing yourself hard enough include sweating, heavy breathing and an inability to say more than a few words without taking another breath. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits Brain MRI and PET scans taken before the program began and six months later showed signs in 9 out of the 10 participants that the dopamine-producing brain cells probably became healthier. “We knew that exercise was good for symptoms, but this study shows that it’s actually neuroprotective,” says study coauthor Sule Tinaz, M.D., associate professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine. Tinaz and her colleagues hope to replicate the results of this study in a larger randomized controlled clinical trial. What kind of exercise works best? By now you may have put on your sneakers and are ready to get started. So what kind of exercise helps people with PD? Much of the research on this topic is on aerobic exercise. Also known as “cardio,” it’s the kind of exercise that gets your body moving and your heart pumping, like dancing, jogging, swimming, tennis, cycling, brisk walking and stair climbing. The emphasis here is on getting your heart rate and breathing up above your general resting state. “You want to make sure people are pushed,” Gilbert says. ﻿Taking a brief stroll around the block without raising your heart rate is probably not as good as really getting a workout in, she adds. The Parkinson’s Foundation’s exercise guidelines call for at least 90 minutes of cardio as part of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each week. The Foundation recommends that everyone with PD see a physical therapist specializing in PD for a full functional evaluation and recommends exercise during “on” periods, when taking medication. According to the Parkinson's Foundation, your weekly 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise should include: Aerobic activity: 3 days/week, at least 30 minutes per session of continuous or intermittent movement at moderate or high intensityStrength or resistance training: 2-3 nonconsecutive days/week for at least 30 minutes per sessionBalance, agility and multitasking: At least 2-3 days/week — every day, if possible — of exercises that rely on these skillsStretching: At least 2-3 days/week; every day, if possible. Start where you are…with a push How to raise your heart rate, and how much, depends on your current fitness level and abilities, your medical history, your medications and other individual health factors. If you’re not a regular exerciser yet, it might not take much to get your heart rate up, or you may take medications that mean you shouldn’t increase your heart rate past a certain point. But if you’ve been working out regularly for a while, you may need more intense physical activity to get your heart pumping harder. No matter where you start, exercise that gets the heart pumping harder has benefits for people with PD. In the study that tracked 237 people with early Parkinson’s for five years, people benefited from exercise regardless of their fitness level or physical abilities at the start of the study. This shows it’s never too late to start exercising to get long-term benefits — no matter your fitness level or your disease stage. Start with whatever is a challenge for you and work your way up to 150 minutes of exercise activity per week, Gilbert says. “Exercise is one of the best things we can do for ourselves, especially when living with Parkinson’s. Knowing that, many people ask not just ‘what’s the best exercise?’ but also﻿ ‘how much should I exercise?’﻿ That’s a balance each person has to find for themselves. Exercise should feel hard. It should challenge you and make you sore and somewhat fatigued. But not so sore that you are injured or so exhausted that you can’t do your normal activities,"" neurology and lifestyle medicine physician and movement disorder specialist, Rachel Dolhun, M.D., principal medical advisor at The Michael J. Fox Foundation wrote on LinkedIn in May in response to a recent report on the possibility of overexercise with Parkinson's. Choose exercises that challenge your brain What was that about dance and learning new skills? You may get more benefits from exercise that challenges your brain to think and learn while you move your body, Gilbert says, like dance. “Learning something new, learning how to move in a new way, can change the biology of the brain,” she says. Animal studies, she says, have shown that a moderate-intensity but mentally challenging exercise may improve blood flow to the brain more than a high-intensity but familiar exercise would. So, given the choice between the same daily brisk walk and your first-ever tango class, choose tango. Dancing, in fact, may not only raise your heart rate and teach you something new, but it may also benefit your mood. For some people with PD, depression takes a greater toll on quality of life than movement problems do. In a study published in 2024 in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, 23 people with PD took weekly dance classes at Canada’s National Ballet School for eight months. Building on previous research that showed dance classes helped with movement, mood and functions of daily living, this study found that after the dance classes, participants reported fewer symptoms of depression, and MRIs showed fewer biological signs of depression. Besides the exercise and learning components, dance classes also give you a chance to socialize, which can help reduce symptoms of depression. ﻿﻿ Video: How Pickleball Helped This Player Manage Parkinson’s ﻿Boxing has gotten support from Parkinson's research studies as well. Several small studies have shown that boxing can improve motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease. Researchers suggest it’s the aerobic and strength training, along with balance and footwork and stretching that’s beneficial. Group boxing classes, like dance classes, also come with camaraderie built in. Whether it’s tango, pickleball or ping-pong, pick something you’ll enjoy so that you stick with it. “When you have Parkinson’s disease,” Langeskov-Christensen says, “it becomes more difficult to motivate yourself﻿.

Medication now available to treat age-related vision loss By Beth Levine, AARP Comments En español Published December 17, 2021 Shutterstock / megaflopp Toni Wright, 54, a beauty industry professional from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was forever squinting at her computer screen and cellphone. In restaurants, especially those with low lights, she was the one holding the menu as far away as her arm could reach. Diagnosed with presbyopia﻿ — age-related blurred near vision﻿ — when she was 50, Wright says, “I needed to have reading glasses with me at all times and almost panicked if I didn’t.” Presbyopia is estimated to affect 2 billion people globally, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). But there is good news for all the squinters among us: In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first (and so far, only) eye drops that treat presbyopia. ﻿The eye drops, called Vuity﻿, contain pilocarpine, which has been used for around 120 years to treat glaucoma. This is the first formulation to target presbyopia specifically. Allergan, a subsidiary of AbbVie, rolled out Vuity on Dec﻿. 9. Available by prescription only, Vuity works very simply﻿. Itslightly reduc﻿es pupil size by constricting certain muscles, explains AbbVie advisory board consultant Marguerite McDonald, M.D., ﻿a clinical professor of ophthalmology at both New York University and Tulane University. The constriction allows for improved up﻿-close vision. Approved for use once daily, it works for up to six hours. It costs about $86 for a 2.5 ﻿milliliter bottle﻿ (about a 30-day supply), depending on the pharmacy you visit. ﻿ Wright, who participated in the clinical trial for Vuity, would put the drops in her eyes in the morning, and she found that the effect kicked in by the time she got to work. McDonald says, on average, it should start working within 15 minutes. “I could see on my computer without struggling or needing glasses, and it lasted throughout the workday,” Wright reports. She says she felt no negative side effects. ​Vuity reports that users may experience temporary problems when changing focus between near and far objects.​ In its development of the drops, the company found that participants achieved a “three-line gain or more reading a near﻿-vision eye chart without losing more than one line in a distance vision eye chart at Day 30, three hours after dosing.” ​ “We know a great deal about the active compound pilocarpine. It was used in higher concentrations and it's very safe,” McDonald﻿ says. She adds that the drops can be used with contact lenses, but as with all eye medications, users should wait 15 minutes after application before inserting lenses. If using other eye drops, wait five minutes between different applications. Steven Plotycia, M.D., an ophthalmologist affiliated with Mount Sinai Medical Center﻿ in New York, warns that the drops may not work for everyone with presbyopia. “The ideal patient for these drops are people in their 40s to 50s who don’t want to wear reading glasses. The age group is old enough to have developed presbyopia but young enough that they would not have started developing cataracts,” he explains. Cataracts are lenses that have started to yellow, restricting the amount of light that gets in, making vision appear darker. Since Vuity acts by constricting the iris, limiting the amount of light that hits the lens, cataract patients will find that the drops make their vision appear even darker. They would have a lot of trouble driving at night or in other situations where light is low. “The significance of this FDA approval is massive. Glasses, contact lenses, and surgery are traditional treatments, but, for various reasons, do not work well for every patient. Having a novel treatment option in the form of a presbyopia eye drop is a welcome addition to our armamentarium against this universal age-related near vision condition that effects essentially everyone over the age of 40,” says Christopher Starr, M.D., clinical spokesperson for the AAO. Nine similar eye drops for presbyopia are in development and may be available in the future. Beth Levine is a health writer whose work has appeared in O: The Oprah Magazine, Woman's Day, Good Housekeeping, ﻿Reader's Digest and many more.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

The article discusses the FDA's approval of Vuity, the first eye drops to treat presbyopia, a age-related condition that affects near vision. The key findings show that Vuity, containing pilocarpine, improves up-close vision by constricting the pupil, and is effective for up to six hours with minimal side effects. A novel insight is that Vuity offers a new treatment option for presbyopia, which may be particularly beneficial for individuals in their 40s and 50s who are not ready for reading glasses or surgery. The approval is significant, with several similar eye drops in development, potentially offering more treatment options in the future.",32

Some of the early warning signs include shortness of breath, coughing up mucus and wheezing and chest tightness, according to the American Lung Association. At first these symptoms can be easy to overlook or mistake for another common ailment — especially during COVID-19 surges or cold and flu season. But doctors warn that they shouldn’t be ignored. “If symptoms are short-lived, then maybe it’s nothing. But if they go on, don’t just chalk it up to something like an infection. It may be something more serious,” says Jessica S. Wang Memoli, M.D., a pulmonologist and director of Bronchoscopy & Interventional Pulmonary at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. If you do have a lung disease like COPD, an early diagnosis means earlier access to treatments, which may forestall additional lung function loss. Here are three warning signs to pay attention to. 1. Shortness of breath While it’s true that lung function declines with age, meaning breathing may gradually become more difficult, sudden shortness of breath during routine activities is not normal. So if you notice that you’re out of breath out of the blue, that’s a sign you should see a doctor. “If you were able to walk up a couple flights of stairs a couple of weeks ago, and then today you just feel more winded, that could be a sign that maybe something else is going on,” Wang Memoli says. If your breathing is noisy — you’re wheezing — that’s another red flag. Also, pay attention to an overall low-energy feeling, which can be a warning sign of lung disease, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 2. A cough that won’t go away — and won’t get better It’s not uncommon for a routine respiratory infection to cause a cough that sticks around for a few weeks — maybe even longer. But if your cough prevails and doesn’t get better over time, “then it’s something to be a little bit more concerned about,” Wang Memoli says. The American Lung Association recommends getting checked out if you have a cough that lasts more than eight weeks. Also, see a doctor if you’re coughing up mucus or phlegm for more than a month. Coughing up blood is another sign that shouldn’t be ignored, says Gerard J. Criner, M.D., director of Temple Lung Center in Philadelphia. 3. Chest pain or tightness While often thought of as a cardiovascular issue, pain or tightness in the chest can be related to pulmonary complications, Wang Memoli says. A sharp stabbing pain that hits when you breathe in or cough could point to pneumonia. And chest tightness is a common symptom of COPD, which is when the airways become damaged (less air flows in and out), making it hard to breathe. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. Spotting symptoms early could improve treatment odds Many conditions that fall under the lung disease umbrella are treatable or manageable with medications and other therapies, Wang Memoli says. In some cases, like with lung cancer, the second most common cancer in the U.S., early detection “results in improvement in survival,” Criner says. Finding lung cancer early, when it’s more curable, can decrease mortality by up to 20 percent, research shows. And in other diseases, like COPD, which affects some 16 million Americans, “if you intercede and treat patients, they have a much better quality of life,” Criner adds. Treatment for COPD may include medicines like bronchodilators to relax the muscles around the airways and steroids to reduce inflammation. Some people with COPD may also receive oxygen therapy. During an evaluation, your doctor will likely ask about your work history and other possible exposures, since everything from air pollution to smoking can cause lung disease. “Someone who spent their lifetime working in construction, with or without good protection, is at risk for occupational lung disease,” says Jamie Garfield, M.D., a volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association and a professor of thoracic medicine and surgery at Temple Lung Center. “So if they develop the cough in their 60s … I would be suspicious for the beginning symptoms of an occupational lung disease,” Garfield adds. Your doctor may use a machine called a spirometer to measure how much air you can breathe in and out. This test is commonly used to help diagnose asthma and COPD. A chest X-ray can also help your doctor see what’s happening in the lungs. Lower your risk of lung disease You can do some things to lower your risk for developing lung diseases, health experts say. If you smoke, quit. Doing so is “very difficult,” Garfield acknowledges, but “your doctor has resources available to help.” And if you are 50 or older and are, or used to be, a heavy smoker, talk to your doctor about getting screened for lung cancer, Wang Memoli says. Screening recommendations from the American Cancer Society recently changed to include adults ages 50 to 80 (ACS) who currently smoke or used to smoke the equivalent of one pack a day for 20 years, no matter how long ago they quit. Also, test for radon (a colorless, odorless gas known to cause lung cancer) in your home, and steer clear of asbestos, dust and chemical fumes. And since some lung diseases are caused by germs, be sure to keep up with handwashing and stay up-to-date on your vaccines, including shots for flu and COVID-19. Health officials also recommend that people 65 and older get a pneumococcal vaccine, which can help protect against pneumonia. The take-home message, Wang Memoli says, is that “if [your symptoms] are significant enough where they’re bothering you, don’t ignore them.” Women and lung disease The number of women in the U.S. diagnosed with lung disease, and dying from lung disease, is on the rise. Here’s what you need to know: Three of the most common lung diseases in women are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. In every year since 2000, more women than men have died from COPD. In 2018, chronic lower respiratory disease, primarily COPD, was the fourth leading cause of death among women. The percentage of women, especially young women, with asthma is rising in the U.S., and the reason is unclear to researchers.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fda-alzheimers-drug-lecanemab-leqembi/,"Alzheimer’s Treatment Leqembi Gets Full FDA Approval Research shows the medication can help slow the progression of the disease By Rachel Nania, Updated July 06, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published January 06, 2023 / Updated July 06, 2023 Andrew Brooks / Getty Images The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted, for the first time, full, traditional approval for an Alzheimer’s medication that is designed to do more than treat the symptoms of the memory-robbing disease. The drug, lecanemab (brand name Leqembi), was shown in clinical trials to help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s, which affects more than 6.5 million older Americans and for which there is no cure. “This is a big deal,” says Ronald Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Though there’s still work to do when it comes to finding medications that can treat Alzheimer’s, he says, “we’ve been waiting for this kind of breakthrough in the field for many, many years, and it’s a step in the right direction.” The FDA granted lecanemab what’s known as accelerated approval in January. This fast-tracked approval process is reserved for drugs that treat serious conditions and appear promising based on preliminary evidence. In June, a committee of experts that advises the FDA voted in favor of fully approving lecanemab based on key findings from its large, late-stage clinical trial data. The medication, a monoclonal antibody, significantly reduced the amount of amyloid in the brain. (Amyloid, a protein that clumps together to form plaques that disrupt cell function, is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.) It also slowed the rate of cognitive decline — or the loss of thinking and memory skills — in people with early to mild Alzheimer’s disease by 27 percent over an 18-month period. Essentially, that means the medication “may preserve the person’s level of function for a longer period of time,” Petersen says. “You’re not stopping the disease, so people do not actually stay at their precise level, but they progress much more slowly,” he adds, noting that this could be especially helpful for someone in the early stages of Alzheimer’s who is still able to work, pay bills and live independently. “Today’s action is the first verification that a drug targeting the underlying disease process of Alzheimer’s disease has shown clinical benefit in this devastating disease,” Teresa Buracchio, acting director of the Office of Neuroscience in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release. Another Alzheimer’s treatment that targets amyloid, called aducanumab (brand name Aduhelm), received accelerated approval from the FDA in 2021. However, this medication has not been fully approved. Who can get the treatment? Lecanemab is not for people with moderate or late-stage Alzheimer’s. The FDA has approved it only for people in the early stages (sometimes called mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s) and mild stages who have a confirmed presence of amyloid in the brain. Currently, the way health care providers check for amyloid is with a PET scan or a spinal tap, both of which are expensive and invasive. Researchers are making progress on blood tests that could be used to diagnose Alzheimer’s, but they are not yet available in most clinical settings. “They’re all just on the edge of getting out there,” says Jason Karlawish, M.D., a professor of medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine and codirector of the Penn Memory Center. Another limitation: The medication is given through an intravenous infusion every two weeks, which can be a barrier for people who lack transportation or live far from a hospital or infusion center. Side effects should be considered too. In studies, patients taking the medication reported everything from irritation at the infusion site﻿ to flulike symptoms to more serious events, including swelling and bleeding in the brain. Some of these bleeding events are small and detected only on an MRI scan; others are larger and can be fatal.﻿ “The drug has real benefits, but it also has real risks,” says Karlawish, who adds that patients will want to discuss their individual risks — from medications they may be taking to any genetic risk factors they may have — with their doctor before taking the treatment. Patients treated with lecanemab who have two copies of the ApoE4 allele have a higher risk of these more severe swelling and bleeding side effects. The same goes for those taking anticoagulant medications. Finally, patients will need to work with a provider who is participating in what’s known as a registry to collect information on the safety and effectiveness of the medication. That’s because in June, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that it will cover Alzheimer’s treatments that are fully approved by the FDA for people with Medicare Part B, as long as the health care provider is part of a registry. (In contrast, Medicare coverage for Alzheimer’s treatments under accelerated approval is limited to patients enrolled in clinical trials, as is the case for aducanumab.) The CMS said in a news release that registries are common tools that have been used to gather information on patient outcomes for decades. Petersen notes that registry participation may be an additional hurdle for some doctors and could have “a slight impact on access.” Eisai via AP Lecanemab’s drugmaker has priced the treatment at $26,500 a year, making it out of reach for many who don’t meet the coverage requirements and for those without insurance. Eisai via AP Alzheimer’s research continues While it’s exciting to have a new disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer’s, Petersen says it’s important to keep in mind that lecanemab “is not a panacea” when it comes to treating the disease. Researchers are studying additional amyloid-clearing drugs for Alzheimer’s treatment, as well as medications that attack different targets that fuel the disease process. Many experts predict it will take a combination of targeted therapies to conquer the disease. “Hopefully, this [latest approval] is a stimulus for us to really continue doing this,” Petersen says about the research. The health care system will also need some adjustments to accommodate the swell of older adults seeking diagnosis and treatment for Alzheimer’s, Karlawish says. By 2060, the number of Americans living with the disease is predicted to hit an estimated 14 million, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “This certainly is a net positive event and opens up a lot of opportunities for innovation,” Karlawish says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/brain-health/microplastics-in-brain/,"Microplastics Found in Human Brains Raise Health Concerns More plastics in the environment seem to mean more in our bodies, though its impact is unclear By Elise Ceyral, AARP Comments En español Published February 12, 2025 Getty Images Inside the human body, you’ll find muscles, bones, blood and organs — but plastic? As plastics have become a central part of our lives, health professionals have grown increasingly wary about the levels of tiny plastic particles in our bodies. Microplastics are smaller than a sesame seed. Nanoplastics are even smaller, small enough to enter the body’s cells. Recent studies have found them in human lungs, kidneys, livers, bladders and more. A new study in Nature Medicine found them at alarming levels in the brains of people who had died with dementia and without dementia. In autopsy tissues, the researchers found higher levels of the plastic particles in brain samples than in liver and kidney samples — seven to 30 times higher. And brain tissue from people who died more recently, in 2024, had 50 percent more plastic than from people who’d died eight years earlier, in 2016. The overall weight was estimated at seven grams, about the weight of a small plastic spoon. “I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, ‘There’s a bunch of plastic in my brain and I’m totally cool with that,’” Matthew Campen, professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico and a lead author of the Nature Medicine study, said in a news release. The higher levels seen in 2024 than in 2016 seem to mirror the rise in global plastic production, the researchers say. Some microplastics come from the breakdown of larger plastic items, such as synthetic clothing and food packaging, while others are created small, such as microbeads, added to beauty products before the U.S. government ban took effect in 2019. The tiny particles can enter our bodies through the air we breathe, the foods we eat, water we drink, as well as skin contact. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits “We now hypothesize that most of the plastics we are seeing like these are actually extremely old degradation products,” Campen said in a news conference. The brains of people diagnosed with dementia had higher plastic levels In a subset of autopsy tissues from people diagnosed with dementia, levels of the tiny plastics were about five times higher than in the brains without dementia. But it remains unclear whether microplastics increase the risk for the disease or whether dementia somehow leads to the accumulation of microplastics in the brain. “The findings for dementia thus far don’t prove a causal relationship,” says Gary Small, M.D., chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center and behavioral health physician in chief at Hackensack Meridian Health. Small did not participate in the study. “We do know that with dementia, there’s damage to the blood-brain barrier, which means that potential toxins [including microplastics] from the bloodstream can leak into the cerebrospinal fluid to get to the brain. So maybe we’re seeing higher counts because of that leakage,” he says. “Or it could be that the nanoplastics are causing damage.” Either way, such high levels of microplastics are concerning, Campen said in a news release. “I never would have imagined it was this high. I certainly don’t feel comfortable with this much plastic in my brain.” In 2024, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found microplastics in nearly 60 percent of the participants’ carotid arteries. These people experienced a 4.5 times higher risk of heart attack, stroke and death at a 3-year follow-up. Science-backed ways to reduce your risk for dementia Whether microplastics are harmful to your brain is an open question. But as researchers look for answers, there are key lifestyle behaviors you can adopt now to help lower your risk of cognitive decline. Here are a few important ones. For the full list, go here: Get your hearing checked. Hearing loss may reduce neural stimulation and increase social isolation. AARP offers an at-home hearing test.Keep your cholesterol in check. High levels of LDL — or “bad” — cholesterol in the brain raise stroke risks and boost two proteins, amyloid and tau, that are known to clump up in Alzheimer’s disease.Prevent or reduce high blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered elevated when it rises above 120 mm Hg systolic (the top number) and above 80 diastolic mm Hg (the bottom number). Some ways to lower blood pressure include a healthy diet, regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight.Exercise regularly. “When you exercise, it gets your heart to pump oxygen and nutrients to your brain and improves the brain circulation of these essential nutrients,” Small says. This could help reduce your risk for dementia.Stimulate your brain. Avoid activities that leave you mentally passive, says Dylan Wint, M.D., director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. Hours sitting in front of the TV, he says, might not make you feel very stimulated. More mentally engaging activities include reading, learning a new language, or picking up a new instrument.Stay connected to others. People who are socially isolated are at higher risk for dementia. Strong relationships support cognitive health.Cut back on alcohol. Alcohol raises your risk for obesity, depression and hypertension. Recent studies suggest no amount of alcohol is good for the brain. Elise Ceyral is an associate editor of AARP The Magazine and the AARP Bulletin.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

A recent study found alarming levels of microplastics and nanoplastics in human brains, with higher concentrations in individuals who died with dementia and in those who died more recently. The study's findings suggest a possible link between microplastic exposure and dementia, although the causal relationship remains unclear. Notably, the levels of microplastics in brain tissue were 7-30 times higher than in liver and kidney samples, and had increased by 50% between 2016 and 2024. The study's results raise concerns about the potential health impacts of microplastic exposure.",35
https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/organic-food/?intcmp=AE-FOD-BB-LL4,"What You Need to Know About Organic Food 2 experts weigh in on the benefits of locally grown and the cost trade-offs By Mark Bittman and David L. Katz AARP Comments En español Published March 03, 2020 Keith Brofsky/Getty Images Does any old apple a day keep the doctor away? Or does it have to be organic? The answer is, honestly, “That's impossible to say right now.” Why is that? First of all, almost nobody eats purely organic versus purely nonorganic, so it's impossible to divide people into two groups for comparison. There's an overlap, and when two groups that are supposed to be different are a bit alike, their outcomes look more like one another. So there's no evidence that organic foods are better for you? We didn't say that. There is a burgeoning array of large observational studies that look at people who reported willfully eating organic routinely versus people who didn't. As of this writing, the most recent study is out of France, where researchers found a significant difference in cancer incidence between those who eat organic routinely versus those who don't. (Those people who ate organic most often had the least cancer, as you'd expect.) Well, doesn't that mean that organic is better after all, if it keeps you from getting cancer? The study really isn't conclusive, though. Aaargh. Why not? Maybe what makes the two groups different is the total level of care they take with their health. It could be that all those people eating organic have access to better medical care, more cash to spend, higher quality of life — that kind of thing. Generally, organic food costs more, which means more well-to-do people — those with better health care and usually better living situations — are more likely to be the ones eating better. So we still don't know for sure. But at least, for the first time, we have a strong association between routine consumption of organic food and an important health outcome. Sue Tallon If I'm looking at organic and nonorganic apples side by side at a store and I can't afford the organic ones, what should I do? A nonorganic apple is better than no apple and better than most other choices. Rinsing conventionally grown produce reduces the pesticide residue and so arguably narrows the difference between organic and not organic. So, yes, get the nonorganic apples and wash them well. It's almost safe to say, “Never pass up an apple.” What about trying to eat locally? ""Locavore” is a relatively new term but an ancient way of eating. Locavores eat — or try to eat — food produced locally, although, of course, the word “local” is pretty vague. Before food was shipped, everyone was a locavore. Now the term has come to have a deeper meaning: that what you eat matters to your health, and the quality and composition of what you eat are in turn determined by how the food is raised, what it's fed and where it's from. Sue Tallon Don't Panic, Eat Organic Since 2004, the Environmental Working Group has been publishing the Dirty Dozen, its annual list of fruits and vegetables most likely to contain pesticide residue, even after being washed. If you're choosing to buy some organic produce, these are the ones to prioritize. Strawberries Spinach Kale Nectarines Apples Grapes Peaches Cherries Pears Tomatoes Celery Potatoes Why is it worth spending extra time and, usually, money to eat locally? Reducing the carbon footprint, supporting local economies, eating seasonally (and fresh), knowing where your food comes from and how it was raised … all these are inarguably positive attributes, and all are characteristics of local food. No one but a fanatic could eat only local food, but concentrating on these attributes would mean you were eating better, more ethically, more sustainably. If you know your produce is being grown on a local farm where chemicals are not being used, you know that you are avoiding those chemicals. If you know the soil is being nurtured appropriately, you know it's rich in nutrients. If your food has not been in storage and transit for days or weeks, it will have much more of its native nutrient content when you eat it. So local sourcing means the foods have better nutrient composition? In general, yes; though if you're sourcing industrially produced corn locally, then probably not. It makes sense that agriculture and health are connected — there's no way around it. So the more you know about how and where plants are grown, the more confident you can be about their nutrient quality. Does soil composition affect animal products, too? Oh yeah. This issue is even more important when you consider animal foods. The nutrient composition of meat is substantially connected with the diet and exercise pattern of the animal. Meat is leaner and has less saturated fat when animals get more exercise, for instance. The composition of meat also varies with what animals eat and the nutrients in those plants, which are in turn influenced by the soil. Sue Tallon Sue Tallon Don't Panic, Eat Organic Since 2004, the Environmental Working Group has been publishing the Dirty Dozen, its annual list of fruits and vegetables most likely to contain pesticide residue, even after being washed. If you're choosing to buy some organic produce, these are the ones to prioritize. Strawberries Spinach Kale Nectarines Apples Grapes Peaches Cherries Pears Tomatoes Celery Potatoes Healthy, nutritious soil means healthy, nutritious meat? When animals graze on grass, as opposed to grains, they keep the soil healthy and produce better meat. And pasture-raised animals may have lower risks of industrial foodborne scourges like E. coli O157:H7, a strain that can cause severe infection and even kidney failure. It came from the intestines of cattle, particularly those that were fed grain rather than grass! So if animal rights and environmentalist arguments don't motivate you to eat local, remember that it also matters to your personal health. Having said that, it is, of course, possible to produce bad or nutritionally deficient food locally. But a main advantage of sourcing locally is that you can see or learn about the production of your food and easily make that judgment. It's also pretty safe to say that a locavore diet does not include nationally distributed food products made in a factory somewhere, which pretty much means it excludes junk food. Does that mean locavores can eat whatever they want? Grass-fed burgers and locally produced cheese all day! Not exactly. It's still important to have a plant-predominant diet, along with balance and variety. Adapted from How to Eat: All Your Food and Diet Questions Answered by Mark Bittman and David L.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/osteoporosis-warning-signs/,"5 Signs of Osteoporosis Early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce your fracture risk Getty Images By: Nicole Pajer, AARP En español Published September 16, 2021 Bone density isn’t something most of us think about — until that moment when, out of the blue, we break something. “Probably 50 percent of women and 25 percent of men are expected to have an osteoporosis-related fracture in their lifetime,” explains Joy Wu, M.D., associate professor of medicine and endocrinology at Stanford Health Care. But there are ways to know, long before you break a bone, whether you’re losing skeletal mass﻿ —﻿ and to take steps to protect yourself. “Ultimately, we are most worried about hip fractures,” Wu says. But simple lifestyle changes can help reduce your fracture risk, and effective medications are available if needed. The earlier you can get diagnosed and start a treatment protocol, the better the outcome. Here are five things to look out for. 1. You use your arms to get out of a chair If you need to use your arms to push off, it may be a sign of weakening muscles, which are a good predictor of weakening bones. “Our bones and our muscles work as a unit; they get stronger as a unit and tend to get weaker as a unit,” explains Bess Dawson-Hughes, lead scientist in the Bone Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Difficulty getting into or out of a chair is a result of reduced muscle mass in the thighs. And lower muscle mass is a strong predictor of bone problems. “It is also a strong predictor of falling,” she explains. “When you have weak leg muscles, you are more likely to fall and therefore have a fracture.” Incorporating muscle-strengthening exercises into your daily routine can help to improve bone quality, says Stephen Honig, M.D., director of the NYU Langone Osteoporosis Center. 2. You’re taking thyroid medication High levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with the formation of new bone mass. While some people may have naturally overactive thyroids, hypothyroidism (low thyroid activity, often caused by an autoimmune issue) is more common. It’s also common for those with underactive thyroids to receive higher than necessary doses of replacement hormones, says Kendall Moseley, M.D., medical director of the Johns Hopkins Metabolic Bone & Osteoporosis Center. “It is important that doctors find the correct thyroid hormone dose to satisfy the body’s metabolism needs, but not to overtreat, which can lead to bone loss.” 3. You’re noticing some hearing loss One study of nearly 144,000 women found that osteoporosis and low bone density were independently associated with up to a 30 percent higher risk of developing moderate or severe hearing loss. That means any decrease in your ability to hear may signal an underlying issue. Over 300,000 people 65 and older are hospitalized each year for hip fractures. More than 95 percent of those fractures are caused by falling, usually by falling sideways. Women experience three-quarters of all hip fractures. Osteoporosis plays a role. Why the two are related is unclear, says Sharon Curhan, M.D., physician and epidemiologist with the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Possibly, the aging-related changes in the composition and function of the bones that surround the ear, which protect the nerves and structures that play important roles in hearing and balance, may lead to hearing loss,” she says. 4. Your lower back hurts Maybe you just pulled a muscle reaching for a high shelf. But if the pain persists for more than a few days, consider having it looked at: Pain in your lumbar region could mean you’ve experienced an osteoporosis-related fracture. “I have seen people fracture their spine while stooping to pick something up, such as a newspaper, or leaning over to brush their teeth,” says Daniel G. Arkfeld, M.D., a rheumatologist with Keck Medicine of USC at the University of Southern California. The result, he says, can range from a mild pull to incapacitating pain. Adding insult to injury, these fractures can, over time, make you shorter. Anyone who’s lost 1½ inches or more in height should be evaluated for osteoporosis. 5. You’re frequently bloated or constipated Digestive conditions such as colitis and Crohn’s disease can lead to malabsorption of bone-essential nutrients like vitamin D and calcium. Conditions like these are also inflammatory﻿ —﻿ and “systemic inflammation can increase the rate of bone loss,” says Stuart Weinerman, M.D., an endocrinologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. Steroids like hydrocortisone or prednisone, which are often used to treat the﻿se conditions, can further affect bone health. And many patients with digestive issues cut out dairy or follow restrictive diets that may cause them to miss out on key nutrients responsible for bone health. If you’re experiencing gut symptoms, Weinerman recommends asking your doctor: Can my gut problem worsen bone problems? And should I have a bone density scan?

By April, in most parts of the country, spring has arrived at last. These days, though, asparagus is available in supermarkets year-round, shipped from Peru or Mexico. Does that matter? If you are a seasonal cook, it does. And I am a seasonal cook. Cooking seasonally means waiting until a particular food is ripe in your region. It's about the joy of anticipation. There's a palpable thrill when spring produce finally comes to market, especially when it's asparagus. But then, I have been called fanatical as far as asparagus is concerned. When I was growing up in the Midwest, asparagus was never on the menu at our house. The only fresh vegetables I can recall were the ones we had in summer: green beans, tomatoes, corn and the odd cucumber or radish. The rest of the year, we had handy frozen vegetables that went straight from freezer to saucepan. After I left home, one of my first cooking mentors introduced me to the wild asparagus that popped up in the moist soil near an irrigation ditch on a remote California ranch. It was a small patch, but each day we could harvest a dozen spears, which we boiled quickly in salted water, doused with butter and ate with our fingers. It was insanely good. Such sweetness That's what I aim for when buying local asparagus. Look for smooth, shiny spears with tightly closed tips. Cook them briefly to keep them bright green, and serve them with your choice of sauce. Melted butter, vinaigrette, homemade mayonnaise or extra-virgin olive oil and lemon are good options. Still, asparagus season lasts several weeks, and sometimes plain but perfect doesn't fit the bill. Then it's time to consider roasting or grilling, or spaghetti with asparagus, prosciutto and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Assertive seasoning complements asparagus, too. This recipe I designed veers Chinese, for a quick stir-fry laden with chilies, ginger, garlic and sesame. Far from overwhelming the asparagus, the spicy contrasting flavors pleasantly accentuate the vegetable's sweetness. In the wok, as in life, opposites often attract. Recipe Spicy Asparagus Stir-Fry Serves 4 Ingredients 1 1/2 pounds pencil-thin or medium asparagus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon grated or minced garlic 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 1 serrano or jalapeño chili, finely chopped (seeds removed if less heat desired) 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 3 scallions, slivered 1 (or 2) red Fresno chilies, thinly sliced into rings 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds Handful of cilantro sprigs Steps Snap off tough bottom ends of asparagus and discard. Cut spears into 2-inch pieces (halve thicker pieces lengthwise). Set wok or wide skillet over medium-high heat and add vegetable oil. When oil is hot, add asparagus and toss well to coat. Season well with salt and pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute or so, then add garlic, ginger and serrano chili. Continue stir-frying for another minute, until asparagus is cooked but still firm and bright green. Transfer cooked asparagus to platter. Next, drizzle with sesame oil.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/melatonin-and-sleep/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series Melatonin for Sleep: Does It Work, and Is It Safe? The popular supplement comes with side effects ﻿and questions about its effectiveness By Rachel Nania, Updated July 15, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published June 06, 2022 / Updated July 15, 2024 Filmstax / Getty Images A good night’s sleep is about more than beauty rest. Research has linked quality sleep to better brain, heart and mental health — it can even lower risks for certain cancers. A 2022 study suggests that an increasing number of Americans have trouble getting those all-important z’s. Researchers tracked a fivefold increase in melatonin use among U.S. adults in the past few decades. Published in JAMA, the study found that people take higher doses of the over-the-counter supplement than what’s typically recommended — despite scant evidence that melatonin works for your run-of-the-mill shut-eye issues, including insomnia. “We know that melatonin is often used as a sleep aid, but it’s actually misused as a sleep aid because it’s not a sleep aid,” says Naima Covassin, a coauthor of the study and a sleep disorder expert at Mayo Clinic. Popping a melatonin pill or gummy before bedtime may help you fall asleep a few minutes faster, Covassin says, but it won’t make much of a difference in the number of times you wake up at night or how many total hours you get. “There's actually very little improvement in all of these parameters,” she says. When does melatonin work? To understand when melatonin can be beneficial, it’s important to know more about its role in the sleep-wake cycle. Many consumers are familiar with the bottled version of melatonin — around 6 million U.S. adults reach for it. But melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone the brain produces in response to darkness to help our bodies know when it’s time to go to sleep and when it’s time to be awake. Side Effects of Melatonin Short-term use of melatonin may cause mild side effects, including: Headaches Dizziness Nausea Drowsiness Less common side effects include: Short-term feelings of depression Mild tremor Mild anxiety Abdominal cramps Irritability Reduced alertness Confusion or disorientation Source: Mayo Clinic When melatonin hits the bloodstream (typically a few hours before bedtime), it reduces alertness and “facilitates our ability to fall asleep,” explains David Neubauer, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins Medicine. It also helps cool off the brain and the body, “which helps you sleep better,” says James K. Wyatt, director of the Section of Sleep Disorders and Sleep-Wake Research at Rush University in Chicago. Because melatonin doesn’t have the same sedating effect that many sleep aids provide, taking it in pill form is less helpful on those nights when you can’t seem to fall asleep or stay asleep. Side Effects of Melatonin Short-term use of melatonin may cause mild side effects, including: Headaches Dizziness Nausea Drowsiness Less common side effects include: Short-term feelings of depression Mild tremor Mild anxiety Abdominal cramps Irritability Reduced alertness Confusion or disorientation Source: Mayo Clinic Video: 5 Things to Know About Getting Better Sleep It can work in instances when you want to adjust your biological sleep clock — say, to overcome jet lag after traveling through several time zones or to shift your schedule entirely so you’re going to bed a few hours earlier. ﻿ Melatonin supplements can benefit shift workers who need to sleep during the day, when the body’s melatonin levels are naturally low. That’s when supplementing with melatonin is “actually quite effective,” Covassin says. ﻿ In older adults, it may be able to prolong sleep when taken for an extended period, though more research is needed. A small study from researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston found that when adults ages 55 to 78 took 5 milligrams of melatonin for two weeks, they increased their sleep time by at least 15 minutes, compared with those who took a placebo. Is melatonin safe? 5 tips for getting a better night’s sleep Be consistent: Go to bed at the same time each night, even on weekends. Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing and at a comfortable temperature. Remove electronic devices from the bedroom. Avoid large meals, caffeine and alcohol before bedtime. Get some exercise: Being active during the day can help you fall asleep at night. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ﻿ Melatonin is generally safe and well-tolerated. But just because it’s available in the U.S. without a prescription and sold alongside multivitamins and probiotics doesn’t mean it’s risk-free. (In many countries it can be purchased only by prescription.) “We think since it’s available over the counter that it’s harmless, but it may not necessarily be true,” Covassin says. Short-term use of melatonin supplements can come with a list of side effects, especially when taken in high doses, including headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue and daytime sleepiness. Vivid dreams and nightmares have also been reported. “These are mild, but they can also affect your daytime function; think about if you have to drive or if you have to operate machinery,” Covassin points out. ﻿ The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health says melatonin may stay active in older adults longer, which could lead to daytime drowsiness. The research center notes that information on long-term safety is lacking. More serious, albeit rare, reactions have been linked to melatonin supplements, including changes in heart rate and blood pressure, temporary feelings of depression﻿,﻿﻿ seizures and confusion or disorientation. Melatonin has been shown to affect glucose tolerance, or the body’s ability to handle sugar. There are drug interactions to consider, too. Melatonin can increase bleeding risks among people taking anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs; it can worsen blood pressure in those taking blood pressure medications, and it can stimulate immune function and interfere with immunosuppressive therapy, according to Mayo Clinic.

Get some exercise: Being active during the day can help you fall asleep at night. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ﻿ “So, obviously, this should be taken with caution,” Covassin says. “And that’s my main recommendation. If you are thinking [about taking melatonin] or if you are already taking melatonin, talk with your provider to determine whether it's actually appropriate for you.” It’s important to know that, as with all dietary supplements in the U.S., federal regulations are less strict for melatonin than they are for over-the-counter medicines and prescription drugs. A 2017 study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that the contents of the majority of melatonin products didn’t match what was listed on the label — their concentrations ranged, and so did the presence of other ingredients. ﻿ Adding to the evidence, a study published in 2023 in JAMA looked at melatonin quantities in 25 sleep gummy products, often marketed to children, and found that 22 of them contained different amounts of melatonin than what was declared on the label. The actual quantity of melatonin ranged from 74 percent to 347 percent of the labeled amount; only three products had melatonin levels within 10 percent of the declared quantity. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine offers a tip: When comparing supplement labels, look for the “USP Verified” mark, which indicates that the formulation meets the requirements of the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention. What can you do if you have trouble sleeping? Interested in making adjustments to your sleep schedule? Before you reach for a pill, Neubauer recommends trying natural methods. You can do this by getting outside and staying active during the day. “Just getting light makes your circadian rhythm more robust, and the more active you are in the daytime, the better chance you have of sleeping more at nighttime,” he says. Because light suppresses the production of melatonin, keep levels low at night — this means limiting the use of your phone, tablet, computer and TV an hour or two before bed. If you have trouble sleeping more generally, talk with a doctor to figure out the cause, Wyatt says. “It’s rare when sleep goes bad just on its own and it’s not because of other things, like the side effects of a different medication or stress or anxiety or depression or a pain disorder that’s insufficiently treated — there are all sorts of things.” A third of U.S. adults report that they usually get less than the recommended amount of sleep (seven or more hours per night for adults), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The good news: ﻿There are treatments for insomnia, and a successful one, cognitive behavioral therapy, doesn’t come in pill form. “We’re starting to realize treating insomnia is not just about getting a better night’s sleep,” Wyatt says. “It’s to significantly reduce risk for some of these negative health outcomes that could come years to decades later.” ﻿ Melatonin and Children Melatonin use isn’t just increasing among adults — more children are taking it as well. In fact, the number of pediatric melatonin ingestions increased 530 percent from 2012 to 2021, with the largest yearly increase (about 38 percent) occurring from 2019 to 2020, a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finds. In 2020, the supplement became the most frequently ingested substance among children reported to national poison control centers — some of these cases required hospitalization. The authors of the CDC report point out that melatonin has become widely available in the U.S. — some children’s varieties are even sold in “gummy” form. It’s considered a dietary supplement and is subject to less regulatory oversight than other over-the-counter (OTC) medications. “Increasing use of OTC melatonin in various formulations, lack of robust manufacturing regulations, and varied dosing recommendations can place children at risk for potential adverse events,” the authors write.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/what-is-the-mediterranean-diet/,"What Is the Mediterranean Diet? It often snags a top spot on ‘best diets’ lists — here’s why By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published July 28, 2023 In the 1950s, a team of researchers around the world began looking at thousands of middle-aged men (40 to 59 years old) living in seven countries — Finland, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, United States and the former Yugoslavia — to see how their diets and lifestyles affected their risk of cardiovascular disease, which had suddenly become the leading cause of death in the U.S. The seminal Seven Countries Study, as it later became known, showed that serum cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and smoking are universal risk factors for coronary heart disease. But that wasn’t the only finding. The researchers also noticed something unusual about the people who lived in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea: They were healthier than people in wealthier Western nations; specifically, they had lower rates of chronic disease and a higher-than-average life expectancy, despite their limited access to health care. As they began investigating the potential reasons, most, if not all, arrows pointed to diet. People living in the Mediterranean countries didn’t eat exactly the same foods, but they did all eat, for the most part, a plant-based diet. And that diet seemed to have a protective effect on heart health and longevity. In 1960, Ancel Keys, the American physiologist who launched the Seven Countries Study, coined what’s now known as the “Mediterranean diet.” What foods are allowed on the Mediterranean diet? The name is slightly misleading because it refers to more of a dietary pattern — of which there are slight variations — rather than a single regimented diet. What all versions have in common, however, is an emphasis on a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, legumes, fish (especially those rich in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, sardines and mackerel) and healthy fats like olive oil. Eggs and dairy products are OK, but only in moderation. The same goes for alcohol. Up to a glass of wine at dinner is given a green light on the Mediterranean plan. “There is no single definition for a Mediterranean diet﻿, since it encompasses the eating pattern of all 16 countries that border the Mediterranean Sea, including parts of Europe, Asia and Africa,” explains Liz Weinandy, an outpatient dietitian and clinical instructor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “It’s healthy for anyone of any age who’s looking to follow an overall healthy eating plan that benefits every part of the body.” But following the Mediterranean diet involves more than simply eating a checklist of foods. Lifestyle plays an equally important role, too. Specifically, eating fresh in-season produce, sitting down to meals with family and or friends, and staying physically active by doing something you enjoy (playing pickleball, for instance, or going for a swim or a long walk outdoors) as opposed to something you don’t (like, say, logging steps on the treadmill or minutes on the elliptical machine). What are the health benefits? The Mediterranean diet is always turning up in the top spot on “best diets” lists — and it’s easy to see why. For one thing, it’s easier to follow than some of the more restrictive diets. But it also has a number of health bona fides. “The Mediterranean diet has always been associated with better heart health,” says Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic. “In recent years, data also shows benefits to many other aspects, such as better mental health and better liver health.” In the years since the Seven Countries Study, subsequent research has shown a significantly decreased risk for cardiovascular disease among people who follow the Mediterranean diet. A review of 185 studies over the past decade, published in 2022 in the journal Nutrients, also found health benefits for lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer. More recent research published in the journal Neurology suggests the Mediterranean diet may even help protect the brain from damage caused by Alzheimer’s disease, the most common type of dementia. Can you lose weight on the Mediterranean diet? Research suggests that following the Mediterranean plan is good not only for weight loss, but for weight-loss maintenance. One study found that people who followed the Mediterranean diet for a year lost as much as twice the weight as those who followed a low-carb diet. But there are a few caveats. Although the Mediterranean plan makes specific suggestions such as “more fruits and vegetables” and “less dairy,” the actual serving sizes aren’t specified, “so it’s easier to gain weight on this plan than it is on some of the others,” Kirkpatrick says. For instance, there’s an emphasis on healthy fats — olive oil in particular, but also nuts and avocados, all of which are heart-healthy. But they’re also high in calories, so it’s important to watch portions. Same goes for red wine, which is allowed — in moderation — on the Mediterranean plan. The only potential downside to this plan is “not paying attention to portion sizes,” Kirkpatrick emphasizes. “You could gain weight on any dietary pattern. It really all boils down to eating until you are no longer hungry — not until you’re full.” Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Women’s Health, Prevention, Health and Reader's Digest.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

The article explores the Mediterranean diet, a dietary pattern that has been associated with numerous health benefits, including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. The diet emphasizes whole, plant-based foods, healthy fats, and moderate consumption of dairy and alcohol, and is characterized by a lifestyle that includes regular physical activity and social eating. Key findings suggest that the Mediterranean diet can aid in weight loss and maintenance, and may even help protect against Alzheimer's disease. A notable insight is that portion control is crucial, as the diet's emphasis on calorie-dense foods like nuts and olive oil can lead to weight gain if not consumed in moderation.",40
https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/exercises-to-live-longer/,"10 Types of Exercise That Can Help You Live Longer From walking to pickleball to yoga, here's what science says about what makes a difference in longevity By Kim Painter, AARP Comments En español Published April 11, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: GettyImages) There’s no doubt: Moving your body can help you live longer. If you move as much as experts suggest – the equivalent of at least 150 minutes of brisk walking or 75 minutes of running each week — you cut your risk of early death by about a third, according to the 201﻿8 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. That level of moderate to vigorous activity, the kind that gets your heart pumping faster, has “a dramatic effect on longevity,” says William Kraus, M.D., a professor of medicine at Duke University who helped create the guidelines. “People live longer, they have less disease of all types.” That includes heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and cognitive decline, he says. But what if you like a little variety? Can your weekly pickleball game count? How about some weight lifting, tai chi, dancing, or even a round of golf? While some forms of exercise are more directly linked with life extension than others, mixing it up is probably a good idea, researchers say. “Ideally, you’re not just doing one thing,” says James O’Keefe, director of preventive cardiology at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, Missouri. At 67, he says, he follows his own advice, fitting pickleball, swimming, yoga, weight lifting, and walks with his wife and dog into a typical week. Here are 10 activities that just might help you see more birthdays. 1. Walking While walking may be the plain vanilla ice cream of physical activity, that doesn’t mean it’s not an excellent choice. And it’s popular, with 32 percent of older adults telling AARP researchers they do some brisk walking for exercise each day. Some are gaining as much as two hours of life expectancy for every hour they walk, according to the American Heart Association. Walking is one of the best-studied forms of physical activity, with clear longevity benefits, Kraus says. And, he notes, while the guidelines urge a minimum of 150 to 300 minutes of such moderate activity each week, you start seeing life-extending benefits with your first brisk steps. You keep building benefits, he says, by doing more. “Get off the screen﻿s, go for a five-minute walk,” and your health starts improving right away, O’Keefe says. Try a 10 minute indoor walking workout with Denise Austin. 2. Running Like walking, running is backed by strong evidence that it can extend lives, Kraus says. The biggest advantage of vigorous activities, like running, is that you can expend the same energy in less time, he says. That appeals to a lot of people, he says, including him: “I run 45 miles a week,’” he says. “If I was trying to walk 45 miles a week, I would do nothing else.” There’s no evidence, he adds, that vigorous exercise per se is dangerous for healthy older adults. The real danger, he says, is suddenly pushing yourself hard when you’re out of shape – like, the inactive people who have heart attacks shoveling snow during winter months. .

One study of 80,000 people found swimmers were 41 percent less likely to die of heart disease or stroke and 28 percent less likely to die early of any cause. Swimming just two-tenths of a mile can give you about the same workout as running a mile, Kraus says. Other ways to get a heart-pumping workout: water walking, water running or a water aerobics class. 4. Dancing Cut a rug, shake your booty, bust a move. Whatever you call it, dancing counts as moderate to vigorous exercise. Dancers not only improve their heart health, they get stronger muscles, better balance, and a better mood, studies suggest. The workout you get will depend on the type of dancing you do and how long you do it. An hour of traditional ballroom dancing works your body about as hard as an hour of brisk walking, according to the National Institutes of Health. An hour of salsa or an aerobic dance class is more like running or swimming laps. 5. Working out with weights As you age, you should work to stay strong, so you can keep doing things like carrying your groceries and climbing stairs, according to the National Institute on Aging. The physical activity guidelines say you should use all your muscle groups (legs, hips, chest, back, abdomen, shoulders and arms) to lift weights, use resistance bands or engage in other strength-building activities at least twice a week. Still, studies clearly linking strength training to longer lives are far behind those on aerobic activities, says Jessica Gorzelitz, an assistant professor of health promotion at the University of Iowa. That’s a remnant, she says, of when strength-building was reserved for “the (Arnold) Schwarzeneggers of the world.” Now, she says, some promising data is emerging. In a 2022 study of nearly 100,000 people ages 55 to 74, she and her colleagues found that older adults who did any weight lifting, but no moderate to vigorous aerobic activity, were 9 percent to 22 percent less likely to die over a decade. Those who met aerobic guidelines and lifted weights once or twice a week had a 41 percent to 47 percent lower risk. Women got a particularly big boost, Gorzelitz says. If you’re not sure where to start, consider joining a class or working with a personal trainer or physical therapist, she suggests. 6. Sitting or squatting exercises O’Keefe suggests trying this test: Lower yourself to sit on the floor, counting how many times you need to touch a hand, knee, or other body part to assist you. Now stand up, doing the same count. You’ve just performed the sitting-rising test (SRT), shown to be strongly linked with life expectancy in older adults. If you need to support yourself more than twice (once on the way down and once on the way up, for example), you have a higher risk of death over the next 6 years, according to a key 2014 study. The risk was highest in those needing the most support. (Note: In that study, participants were barefoot, wore loose clothing, and got coaching on how to improve before final scores were calculated. Also: no one over 70 got a perfect score – meaning no touches going up or down). One way to improve your score, and maybe your lifespan, is to practice sitting and rising from the floor or, if that’s too tough, from a chair, with as little support as needed, O’Keefe says. Or, he says, you could do squats. To do one, stand with your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart, toes forward. Slowly lower yourself to a sitting position, then stand. See an example of how to do proper squats in the #1 Exercise to Do As You Get Older. Gorzelitz is also a big fan of squats: If you can’t squat, she says, at some point you’ll have trouble using a toilet: “It’s an incredibly functional movement.” 7. Tennis, badminton – or pickleball O’Keefe has good reason to think the pickleball he plays three times a week is boosting his lifespan. He was among the authors of a study that followed more than 8,500 Danish people for 25 years, looking at survival odds among those who engaged in various activities. While biking, swimming, jogging, calisthenics, and health club participation were all associated with longer lives, those who played racquet sports stood out. Tennis players lived an average of 9.﻿7 years longer than inactive people; badminton enthusiasts got an extra 6.2 years. The study doesn’t prove the activities led to the longer lives and it didn’t include pickleball, America’s fastest growing sport. But it does suggest pickleball enthusiasts are on to something, O’Keefe says. Like tennis and badminton, pickleball gets your heart beating, and involves lunging, hand-eye coordination, and quick reactions, he says. But it’s also a very social activity – and that gives you an additional longevity boost, he says. Pickleball is “a great way to make friends,” he says, and “have a lot of fun.” That’s a potent recipe for a longer life, he says. For how-to videos and inspirational stories, check out AARP's Guide to Pickleball. 8. Tai chi The physical activity guidelines also say older adults should work on their balance. Tai chi, a popular activity that uses slow, gentle, movements and controlled breathing, may well be “the best exercise for balance,” says Lin Yang, a researcher with Alberta Health Services, in Calgary, Canada. Yang, who studies physical activity in cancer survivors, says there’s no direct evidence that tai chi extends lives, but growing evidence that good balance does. In one study, Yang and her colleagues followed nearly 6,000 people over age 40 for up to 17 years and found that those with poor balance were more likely to die from heart disease, cancer or any cause. Poor balance may be a marker, rather than a cause, of some health problems, she says. But, she says, it likely contributes to deaths by increasing both falls and fear of falling – leading to inactivity. A review of 24 studies﻿, published in 202﻿3, found tai chi reduced the risk of falling in older adults, with protection increasing the longer people practiced it. Tai chi may boost longevity in additional ways. One recent study showed it could lower blood pressure, a major contributor to heart and stroke deaths. 9. Golfing Yes, golf can be a longevity-boosting activity. It’s right there on a list of suggestions for older adults in the official physical activity guidelines, along with mowing the lawn and raking leaves. But mind the details: The suggested activity is “walking as a part of golf.” “Golf is a sport (where) you are doing a lot of moving… assuming you’re not using the cart,” Gorzelitz says. She was part of a study in which more than 270,000 people with an average age of 70 were asked about their activities and followed for 12 years. Death rates were lowest in those who played racquet sports or ran, followed by regular walkers, golfers, swimmers, and cyclers. It was “only one study,” Gorzelitz says, but the bottom line was that all the activities were associated with longer lives, if people did them often enough, with enough vigor. 10. Yoga Yoga can be a strength-training or moderate aerobic activity, depending on the form you practice. A review of 33 studies involving people over age 65 found that yoga can increase walking speed and the ability to rise from a chair – both of which are associated with longer lives, according to researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston. Low impact and functional fitness workouts, such as yoga and pilates, are gaining in popularity, due to their emphasis on flexibility and balance, as well as a lower risk of injury, according to online publication Axios. Some final advice Still not sure which life-extending activities to try? O’Keefe has some advice: “Don’t overthink it. Just get out there.” Video: Beginner Yoga in Your 50s & 60s With Lorrie Lynch Video: Beginner Yoga in Your 50s & 60s With Lorrie Lynch Kim Painter is a contributing writer who specializes in health and psychology.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/heart-health-foods/,"12 Superfoods for Heart Health Add these to your grocery list to lower blood pressure, fight inflammation and slash stroke risk By Alison Gwinn, Updated February 20, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published June 07, 2023 / Updated February 20, 2025 Getty Images ﻿When it comes to heart health, you probably know what the American Heart Association (AHA) offers as its top diet advice: Eat a good balance of fresh, fiber-rich fruits and veggies; whole grains; and healthy proteins, such as nuts, skinless fish and poultry. But recent studies have also named specific cardiovascular all-stars that are worth adding to your rotation. Here are a few standouts to add to your grocery list. 1. Beets﻿ Why: Beets deserve a badge of honor in the veggie family. That’s due to their high doses of nitrates, which help keep blood vessels dilated﻿ and lower blood pressure. Plus they are packed with heart-healthy antioxidants, says Kate Patton, outpatient dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. .A 2018 review of a decade’s worth of studies identified beet juice consumption as an effective way to control blood pressure in both healthy and hypertensive adults. Also know: When it comes to heart health, it pays to see red — or orange or yellow. ﻿ ﻿ “I tell patients to get a variety of different colored foods,” says Patton. Try these other blushing nutrient-rich veggies and fruits: carrots, sweet potatoes, acorn squash, oranges, cantaloupe and papaya. 2. Pumpkin seeds and walnuts Why: A study presented in 2019 at the AHA’s Hypertension Scientific Sessions found that eating pumpkin seeds may help lower blood pressure. According to the AHA, pumpkin seeds are rich in fiber and a variety of nutrients, particularly heart-healthy magnesium (a quarter cup contains 42 percent of the mineral’s RDA). As for walnuts, a 2022 research review found that consuming foods like walnuts that are rich in alpha-linolenic acid was linked to a 10 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease. And 2021 research published in the American Heart Association’s journal Circulation found that eating a half-cup of walnuts a day for two years modestly lowered the subjects’ LDL cholesterol. “Walnuts are good sources of monounsaturated fats,” Patton says. “For people who don’t eat fish, they are a good way to get in those omega-3 fats.” Also know: “Any nuts are good sources of monounsaturated fats,” says Kate Patton, lead outpatient dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic. “For people who don’t eat fish, they are a good way to get in those omega-3 fats.” A 2019 study presented at the European Society of Cardiology showed that eating nuts two or more times a week was associated with a 17 percent lower risk of death from heart disease. But remember one word: moderation. These are calorie-dense foods, so keep portions modest and avoid added salt, sugars and oils. Penny Kris-Etherton, Pugh university professor of nutritional sciences emeritus at Pennsylvania State University advises limiting yourself each day to “an amount that will fit in the palm of your hand.” 3. Tofu ﻿ Why: “This plant-based soy protein contributes isoflavones and is a substitute for animal proteins to help support flood lipid levels,” says Linda Van Horn, chief of the nutrition division in the department of preventive medicine at Northeastern University. Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital reported in 2020 that a study of more than 200,000 people found a link between consuming isoflavone-rich tofu more than once a week and an 18 percent lower risk of heart disease. Beyond that, tofu is a great source of plant protein, so it’s a smart substitute for red meat or pork. “It also has phytosterols — plant cholesterols that actually improve the cholesterol in our own bodies,” Brenes-Salazar says.﻿ Beyond that, tofu is a great source of phytosterols — plant cholesterols that can block the absorption of cholesterol, says Patton. Also know: A 2021 Chinese study found that eating soy four or more days of the week was associated with a significantly lower risk of death from heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends one to two servings (or 5.5 ounces) f protein — from lean meat, chicken, eggs, fish, nuts or soy products — a day. Protein is especially important for aging bodies: “On average, most Americans consume enough protein, but older adults may have lower appetites and are at greater risk of muscle loss,” says Patton. 4. Olives and olive oils Why: If you’ve heard of the Mediterranean diet (and who hasn’t?), then you know all about olive oil. It not only boosts good, heart-protective cholesterol but also staves off diabetes and strokes. Recent research confirms its salubrious effects: A 2020 European study found that patients who had had heart attacks and subsequently followed a Mediterranean diet high in olive oil had better repair of the arterial linings; a 2022 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology﻿ found that consuming more than a half tablespoon of olive oil a day — or replacing about 10 grams a day of margarine, butter, mayonnaise or dairy fat with olive oil — is linked to a lower risk of death by heart disease. Try to follow the USDA guidelines of 27 grams (about two tablespoons) a day. “Remember,” Kris-Etherton says, “olive oil is calorically dense.” As for olives, make sure to buy the low-sodium variety, available at many big-box stores. ﻿ Also know: Other healthy oils for cooking: avocado, sunflower and canola oils, which have mostly healthy fats, says Patton. Getty Images 5. Garbanzo beans Why: First, they’re full of fiber, which can help lower your bad LDL cholesterol and are naturally low in sodium. Second, “beans are an underappreciated source of good-quality protein,” Brenes-Salazar notes. Adds Patton: “All members of the legume family are super healthy because they are full of plant-based protein and the kind of fiber that lowers cholesterol and helps to stabilize your blood sugar levels.” Also know: other heart-healthy legumes — pinto beans, red beans, kidney beans and black beans. And research indicates that eating about ¾ cup a day may even help you lose a little weight. But remember, canned beans can be high in salt, so either rinse them thoroughly in water or use dried beans. Getty Images 6. Avocados Why: “Despite avocados’ high fat content, the fat is heart healthy and monounsaturated,” says Christine Rosenbloom, a registered dietitian and coauthor of Food & Fitness After 50. “Avocado is also rich in fiber, potassium and magnesium, all nutrients associated with heart health. Avocados are sodium-free ... a plus for those with high blood pressure, and avocado oil has a high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it good for pan-searing foods.” A 2022 study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, of almost 70,000 women and more than 40,000 men — all free of coronary heart disease — linked a higher avocado intake with a lower risk of heart disease. Also know: Another study from Pennsylvania State University found that eating one avocado a day led to a slight decrease in unhealthy cholesterol. 7. Oatmeal Why: Touted for its healthy properties for a half-century, fiber-rich oatmeal cuts down on cholesterol absorption and contributes to gut health. “Oatmeal is a good source of healthy fiber, healthy fats and protein,” Patton explains. “Soluble fiber is really important for our digestive tract and keeping blood sugar levels stable.” A meta-analysis published in 2022 in the European Journal of Nutrition found that adding oats to the diet was linked to lower cholesterol levels. Also know: know: Because steel-cut oats, or Irish oatmeal, are less processed than other varieties, they have the most fiber — but remember they take longer to cook. ﻿ Oatmeal can be the foundation of a heart-healthy meal: “It provides an excellent platform for incorporating berries, chopped nuts, yogurt or other additions,” says Van Horn. 8. Whole-grain rices and quinoa﻿ Why: “The more a grain is kept intact, the more nutritional value it has,” says Patton. An analysis by the World Health Organization of about 40 years of studies on the health benefits of dietary fiber found it provided a 15 to 20 percent decrease in cardiovascular-related mortality, including heart disease, stroke, and type-2 diabetes. And whole grains can be good for weight, too: A 2021 Tufts University study found that middle- to older-age adults who ate at least three servings of whole grains daily saw smaller increases in waist size, as well as blood pressure and blood sugar. Also know: Whole-grain bread and cereal are also beneficial. But be wise when shopping. Look at the nutrition label and make sure “whole-grain” is the first ingredient — and watch for added sodium and sugars. “Typically, good whole-grain products have at least two and a half grams of fiber per serving, and less than 140 milligrams of sodium,” says Patton. ﻿9. Salmon Why: The AHA has long recommended eating fish — especially salmon and other oily fishes high in omega-3 fatty acids — twice a week to help stave off the risk of heart failure, stroke and other coronary disease. And a study published in 2022 in the AHA’s journal recommended eating three grams a day of omega-3 fatty acids like those found in salmon. It may not be just the omega-3s that are good for you; a 2018 study found that an ingredient in fish and other seafood called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) may also reduce hypertension-related symptoms. Also know The AHA recommends lake trout, herring, albacore tuna, sardines and mackerel. Should You Bother With Fish Oil?​ We've heard for years that fish oil supplements (and their omega-3 fatty acids) are magic pills against heart disease — in fact, at least 10 percent of Americans take them. However, recent research has cast doubt on their efficacy, including a study presented in November 2020 at the AHA's scientific meeting. It found that for 13,078 people who had heart disease (or were at high risk of it), fish oil pills did not reduce their risk of cardiac events compared with those on a placebo. Not only that, but atrial fibrillation, a potentially dangerous abnormal heart rhythm, occurred more often in those taking the supplement. The bottom line: Although eating fish regularly is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, supplements don't demonstrate the same effect as eating whole fish. ​​​​​ ﻿1﻿0. Blueberries Why: ﻿They’re the epitome of heart-healthy fruits, high in soluble fiber and polyphenols (those antioxidants that absorb free radicals) and vitamin C. A 2019 study out of London found that eating 200 grams of blueberries (about 1 1/4 cup, depending on the size) a day for a month led to lower blood pressure, and a second UK study found that eating 150 grams (about a cup) of blueberries a day lowered the risk of cardiovascular disease by 15 percent. Also know: All berries — strawberries, raspberries, blackberries — have heart-healthy credentials for their fiber as well as their flavonoids and antioxidants. Hate berries? Consider red grapes, which are high in resveratrol, a heart-healthy antioxidant. Getty Images 1﻿1. Broccoli and brussels sprouts Why: Though most veggies are great for cardiovascular health, broccoli and brussels sprouts are ace players. A 2020 Australian study found that these and other cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, are linked to a decline in blood vessel disease. They’re high in disease-fighting flavonoids and carotenoids as well as cholesterol-lowering fiber. Plus, like all veggies, their low caloric density means you can eat a lot without tipping the calorie scale. “You want to aim for such foods as part of a balanced diet because they're going to help with satiety,” Brenes-Salazar says. Also try: spinach, kale, baby greens, Swiss chard and collard greens. “The consensus is that three servings a day of dark-green leafy vegetables will reduce your total risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes,” Patton says. A 2021 study out of Edith Cowan University found that eating around two cup﻿s of nitrate-abundant leafy greens per day can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease by 12 to 26 percent. 1﻿2. Chili peppers Why: These hot little guys are high in a substance called capsaicin. It’s what sets your mouth on fire — but it also has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and blood-glucose-regulating effects. That’s good news for your heart: A 2020 study of 570,000 people found that those who ate chili peppers had a whopping 26 percent lower relative risk of cardiovascular mortality than those who rarely or never ate the peppers. Also know: What’s more, though not nearly as rich in capsaicin as the super-hot variety, sweet green and red peppers are also a good source of the mighty C.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/should-you-get-lasik-surgery/,"Should You Get LASIK Surgery? Know the risks and complications associated with this popular vision-correction procedure By Linda Marsa AARP Comments En español Published April 24, 2019 ALAMY STOCK PHOTO Alejandro Lopez, 62, started wearing glasses when he was in his 20s in order to read the newspaper and see things in the distance, and never liked them. So in 2000, Lopez, who lives in Malverne, N.Y., opted for what was then a relatively new procedure: LASIK, laser surgery to correct vision problems. He distinctly remembers looking at the clock in the operating room before the surgery, and it was too blurry to read the numbers. When he opened his eyes afterward, the clock was suddenly crisp and clear. “It was amazing and so fast. In 10 minutes, my vision had completely changed,” he says. “I was driving and even went to work the next day.” His vision remains good nearly 20 years later. That's the promise of LASIK: After a quick, relatively painless procedure in an eye surgeon's office, you can ditch your eyeglasses and contact lenses. Since 1995, when the FDA approved the first lasers to correct vision, about 9.5 million Americans have opted for the surgery. Some people experience troubling side effects, however, including severe dry eye. Here are a few things to know about the procedure. What is LASIK? LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) is an FDA-approved procedure to treat all three conditions that normally require glasses: nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. Using an ultraviolet laser, surgeons reshape the curvature of the cornea, the transparent dome-like front covering of the eye that refracts light and accounts for about two-thirds of the eye's optical power. With nearsightedness (myopia), the cornea curves too sharply, which focuses light in the front of the retina and blurs distances. Conversely, with farsightedness (hyperopia), when the cornea is too flat, light focuses behind the retina, blurring near vision. With astigmatism, the cornea can be too curved or too flat, which can cloud both close up and distant objects. First, a surgeon will flatten the eye, then cut a flap in the cornea, peeling it back to reveal the section underneath, which is called the stroma. Pulses from the laser destroy part of the stroma, at which point the flap is replaced. The laser is used to reshape the patient's cornea for sharper sight, depending on what needs to be corrected. The procedure itself usually takes only 30 minutes or less, and while patients can't drive themselves home, they often can recover enough to drive within a day or two. It may take a few weeks or months before the eyes heal and vision clears, however. Because it is an elective procedure, it's not usually covered by insurance and costs average about $4,200.

While a 2009 FDA study found that 95 percent of patients were happy with the surgery, a small number, less than 1 percent, had problematic symptoms. Those can include seeing starbursts, glare or permanent halos, and dry eyes, night blindness or worsened vision. ""The risks are low but they're not zero,” says Anat Galor, an ophthalmologist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami Health System. “Anytime you do a surgery, you are damaging nerves. For whatever reason, some people have a propensity to develop chronic pain because their nerves become too sensitive."" One regretful LASIK patient is Paula Cofer, 60, a former banker in Tampa, Fla. She was becoming resistant to her contact lenses and after a long day at work, she found herself constantly putting drops in her eyes. Her sister experienced positive results with LASIK, so Cofer thought the surgery would help. Instead, her eyes became even drier, resulting in constant burning. She also had floaters that made it hard to see at all, especially at night, and her corneas became inflamed from scarring. “It's been a nightmare,” she says. “My vision has gotten worse and no part of my life has been unaffected by what the surgery did to me.” Cofer runs a website for people who have been harmed by LASIK that she says now includes 6,000 people who've had adverse outcomes. But the technology used in the procedure has improved, says Eric Donnenfeld, a New York- and Connecticut-based eye surgeon who reports having performed thousands of LASIK procedures. “The LASIK of today is much safer and more accurate than LASIK of 20 or even 10 years ago."" Who's most at risk for complications Some people are poor candidates for this surgery. They include those who suffer from diseases that affect wound healing, such as autoimmune disorders like diabetes, or those with a history of glaucoma, eye injuries or previous eye surgeries, along with thin corneas, large pupils (which make them more susceptible to glare, halos and starbursts and inhibits night vision) ordry eyes, which tend to be exacerbated by LASIK. And people older than around 55 may not be great candidates for LASIK in general, some say, because aging eyes are changing — or “unstable” in eye doctor parlance: Their corneas become stiffer, and they may be developing cataracts and presbyopia (the nearsightedness that comes with age). ""You're doing surgery on a moving target. Two years from now, what we did today may be no longer be good for your eyes,” says Galor of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. “This diminishes the ability of LASIK to make you independent of glasses."" LASIK surgeons now do preoperative evaluations to identify who might have problems, including dry eyes. “We now have two good treatments for dry eyes, so we'll pretreat patients to prevent complications later on,” says eye surgeon Donnenfeld, who estimates that he excludes about one-third of patients because they're not good candidates for LASIK.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 clear sentences:

The article explores the central theme of whether or not to undergo LASIK surgery, a popular vision-correction procedure, and discusses its associated risks and complications. Key findings indicate that while 95% of patients are happy with the surgery, a small percentage experience problematic symptoms, such as dry eyes, glare, and worsened vision, and certain individuals, including those with autoimmune disorders or dry eyes, are at higher risk for complications. A novel insight is that advancements in LASIK technology have improved its safety and accuracy, and preoperative evaluations can help identify potential issues, allowing for pretreatment to prevent complications. Ultimately, the decision to undergo LASIK surgery should be made with careful consideration of individual factors and consultation with an eye surgeon.",43

Be careful with taking these herbs as supplements in pill form, as some are linked to side effects and medication interactions, and always talk to your doctor before taking any supplement. Here we’ll tell you about how to use some of these fresh and dried herbs. 1. Basil If you thought basil was meant only for making pesto or sprinkling on pizza, think again. Basil is the family name of more than 100 different species. Two of its best-known varietals are sweet basil and holy basil. Researchers who studied sweet basil found that it could help control blood pressure and that its fragrance eased stress and relieved anxiety. Clinical trials focused on holy basil found that participants experienced reduced stress, anxiety, sexual problems and depression. Both studies were done in a lab, however, so the benefits may not translate to at-home use. Tip: As with other fresh herbs, add basil late in cooking; it loses its flavor if cooked too long. 2. Dill Dill is known for its feathery foliage and seeds, and both are used in pickling and cooking. The seeds spice up pickles, flavor borscht and complement fish. Dill has far more going for it than that, however. Researchers at Penn State University recruited 71 men and women with risk factors for heart disease and provided daily meals seasoned with about a teaspoon of added herbs and spices, including dill. After 12 weeks, the participants had both lower systolic (upper number) and diastolic (lower number) blood pressure. Tip: If you want to get rid of bad breath, chew a handful of dill seeds 3. Garlic Although widely used as both an herb and a spice, garlic ­— a member of the lily family ­— is botanically a vegetable. Its pale yellow flesh has been hailed for its ability to fight off the common cold. (Though research hasn’t caught up with grandmother’s advice.) Some research has found garlic helps reduce blood pressure and prevent hardening of the arteries. Tip: To activate its health-promoting compounds, chop or crush garlic five to 10 minutes before cooking or adding to other ingredients. 4. Ginger Some call ginger an herb, others a spice, but no matter what you call it, it’s got a slew of impressive health benefits. Research has found that ginger can ease the pain of knee osteoarthritis, quell the queasiness of motion sickness and seasickness, improve muscle recovery after exercise and reduce high cholesterol. Ginger may even helps at the dentist’s office. Patients who had an impacted molar removed found powdered ginger as effective as ibuprofen in controlling pain after surgery. Tip: The juice left from grating ginger has a lot of flavor. Save the juice and include it in your recipe, recommends Cooks Illustrated. Getty Images 5. Lavender Although it’s an edible herb, most research on lavender focuses on its fragrance. The scent of lavender, a member of the mint family, can relieve anxiety, improve sleep and melt away irritability and stress, according to several studies. Trying to fall asleep? A small bag of lavender blossoms slipped under your pillow at night calms the nervous system by lowering blood pressure and heart rate, relaxing you enough to lull you to sleep. Tip: If you want to use lavender as a cooking or cake-decorating herb, be sure it’s designated as culinary grade. Start out with a small amount; lavender can overpower a dish if you use too much. 6. Lemon balm The wrinkled heart-shaped leaves of this perennial herb were used as far back as the Middle Ages to reduce stress, relieve anxiety and provide a good night’s sleep. It seems to work as well now as it did then. Lemon balm can bring on a feeling of calmness and lift a feeling of negativity, according to a study in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine. Combined with other soothing herbs such as valerian and chamomile, it can promote relaxation. Tip: This minty herb can help heal cold sores and relieve itchy bug bites. Soak 2–4 teaspoons of crushed leaves in a cup of boiling water for 10 minutes. Cool. Use cotton balls to dab the tea on the sores throughout the day. 7. Oregano Its minty flavor and aroma make oregano a winner when it comes to flavoring everything from tomatoes to potatoes. Along with bringing out the best in food, oregano offers some useful health benefits. The leaves are rich in carvac﻿rol, a compound that has proved effective against norovirus, a highly contagious stomach bug. In addition, oregano tea can help boost the immune system and help the body fight infections. Tip: To make oregano tea, mash the leaves of a sprig of oregano in a mug, pour in a cup of boiling water, let steep for five minutes, remove the leaves, add lemon juice and honey to taste. Enjoy! 8. Rosemary Rosemary is a rich source of several antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that may boost the immune system and improve circulation. This piney herb also contains naturally occurring chemicals that can help keep blood sugar in check, important in controlling diabetes. Carnosic acid, an antioxidant abundant in rosemary, helps protect brain cells from age-related changes such as deteriorating verbal skills and increased difficulty in learning new information, says Chris D’Adamo, director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland. He adds that rosemary contains other compounds that may also contribute to improved memory. Tip: Rosemary has an assertive flavor, so go easy when you add it to food. 9. Sage Sage, an evergreen shrub, is a member of the mint family. Its distinctive velvety leaves have a minty, cool fragrance. According to a study in the Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine, sage tea has been customarily used to treat bronchitis, cough, asthma and more. One study concludes that sage can help memory and elevate mood and alertness. As if that’s not enough, it some research has found that drinking sage tea improves levels of cholesterol and triglycerides among people with type 2 diabetes. Tip: A little sage goes a long way, so use it sparingly when seasoning food. Getty Images 10. Thyme As far back as the Middle Ages, this hardy member of the mint family served both as a kitchen staple, providing an earthy flavor to food, and as an herbal medicine to ease bronchitis and relieve coughs. According to ﻿researchers at New York’s Mount Sinai Health, several studies suggest that thyme hasn’t lost its healing powers; it still works to soothe inflamed bronchial tubes and quiet coughs. Tip: To help get rid of a nagging cough, brew a cup of thyme tea. Steep two or three sprigs of fresh thyme (or dried leaves if you don’t have fresh) in boiling water for a few minutes, strain, and add a squeeze of lemon juice and a touch of honey. Grow Your Own Herbs Growing herbs is easier than you think. Here’s some advice from the experts at the New York Botanical Garden. Herbs need ample space. They generally come in small 3- to 4-inch pots. To grow happily at home, they’ll need a bigger pot so the root system can expand to support the plant’s growth.Give them the right light. If you have only partial light indoors, parsley, chives and mint are good bets. In the garden, most herbs prefer a sunny site with good drainage, although some — including parsley, mint, lemon balm and tarragon — like afternoon shade.Mint can be pushy. The many varieties of mints have a habit of taking over the garden when given a chance, so plant them in a large plastic pot that you sink in the ground with the rim just above the soil. This provides a barrier to their habit of rampant growth for about three years.Neglect them a little. The rule of thumb with most herbs is the more you neglect them, the better they grow. Many people kill their herbs with kindness by overwatering and overfeeding. (The exception: basil, which likes to be fed.)How to feed them. Fertilize your herbs with an organic granular fertilizer just at the beginning of the season. Fertilize herbs grown in containers once a month. Basil likes its boost every two weeks.Feel free to pinch. Pinching back herbs encourages them to branch, so the more you harvest them, the better they’ll grow.Starting from seed. To start your own seedlings of basil, sow seeds indoors five or six weeks before the last frost. Seeds will germinate in a few days. When the weather warms and the seedlings each have three pair of leaves, slowly get them used to being outside by increasing their time outdoors over several days, then transplant them to the garden bed about a foot apart.Winter care. As the cooler weather of autumn slows the growth of your garden herbs, consider potting them up and bringing them indoors for the winter. Don’t be surprised if they lose their vigor and look droopy by spring.Don’t overwater indoors. Wet feet (roots) and forced-air heat are the enemy of a rosemary plant wintering indoors. In fact, wet feet are the bane of herbs perched on saucers that protect the furniture. To keep your herbs happy, be sure to empty saucers of any standing water.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/benefits-of-ancient-grains/,"Health Benefits of 7 Ancient Grains Delicious alternatives to brown rice that will make your cardiologist happy Paul Sirisalee By Kelsey Ogletree, AARP En español Published December 01, 2022 ﻿You probably already know that whole grains are better for you than refined grains. Swap white rice for brown rice and you’ll be rewarded with more fiber, more protein, and more vitamins and minerals, says registered dietitian Emma Newell. That means lower cholesterol, more stable blood sugar, better gut health and higher energy levels, among many other benefits. It seems we may be getting the good news about healthy grains. In a study published in November in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers at Tufts University reported that Americans have increased their whole grain intake over the past two decades, although consumption remains far below the recommended 3 ounces a day. Switching from white to brown rice is a good start, but the feel-good can wear off and the taste-bud blahs can set in. Plus, some research indicates that even healthy diets can benefit from greater diversity rather than the same-old, same-old. We asked chef Franklin Becker of the Press Club Grill in New York City for some suggestions on high-fiber options that will delight our taste buds while keeping all our bodily systems humming along. Stick to a half-cup serving — about the size of a computer mouse — at each meal. Here are seven options to try, along with some health benefits and serving suggestions. The nutritional information for each is for one serving. 1. Spelt This ancient grain is one of this list’s leader﻿s for fiber and protein, and it provides essential micronutrients such as iron, magnesium and zinc, says Newell. Spelt is also packed with antioxidants, which are beneficial by removing free radicals that can lead to chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. It has a nutty and slightly sweet flavor similar to whole wheat. Be wary if you have celiac disease or follow a gluten-free diet, however — spelt, a type of wheat, gets most of its protein from gluten. Carbs: 26g Fiber: 4g Protein: 5g Best in: Pilaf with mushrooms and onions, or bread Flavor Boosters Add aromatics like ginger, garlic or scallions while cooking Before serving, toss with thyme or other fresh herbs Cook in vegetable, beef or chicken broth, or toss a Parmesan rind into the cooking water Mix different grains together Throw a bay leaf into the cooking pot 2. Bulgur Nutty and a little chewy, this is used often in Middle Eastern cooking — especially Turkish cuisine. It’s a great option when you’re short on time, since bulgur is parboiled (partially cooked) and dried before being ground, and cooks much faster than other grains. Thanks to its high fiber content, this grain can be a good addition to your plate when you’re working to lower your cholesterol or blood pressure or manage symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation or hemorrhoids. Carbs: 17g Fiber: 4g Protein: 3g Best in: Pilaf with fresh herbs or onions and garlic, or subbed for rice in soups Flavor Boosters Add aromatics like ginger, garlic or scallions while cooking Before serving, toss with thyme or other fresh herbs Cook in vegetable, beef or chicken broth, or toss a Parmesan rind into the cooking water Mix different grains together Throw a bay leaf into the cooking pot 3. Barley As with all whole grains, barley contains properties than can interfere with your body’s ability to digest and absorb nutrients, says Newell. That said, soaking or sprouting barley may help you reap the benefits of this grain, including increasing your body’s ability to access essential vitamins and amino acids. Sweet, chewy and slightly nutty, this versatile, cost-effective staple holds up well in fresh or cooked dishes. Carbs: 22g Fiber: 3g Protein: 2g Best in: Salads, Korean dishes, porridge, or paired with cooked mushrooms and bitter greens like escarole 4. Farro Keep Those Leftovers Grains including farro, quinoa and barley are good cold tossed in salads. Make a big batch to last three to four days in the fridge. With a nice chew, this ancient grain is texturally pleasing and has a strong cashew flavor. You’ll need to combine it with other plant-based foods (such as beans or tofu) to make it a complete protein source — ensuring all amino acids are present in your meal — but it’s a great option for vegetarians looking to up their protein intake. Studies show higher protein intake may have a beneficial effect on blood pressure. Carbs: 27g Fiber: 3g Protein: 5g Best in: Pilafs, salads, cooked risotto-style with Parmesan, or steamed with kale, squash and pears 5. Quinoa Gluten free and a complete protein because it contains all essential amino acids and has high levels of some, like lysine, that may help your body absorb calcium better, quinoa is a staple for carnivores and plant-based eaters alike. It is high in magnesium, a mineral that has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels and have a preventive effect for type 2 diabetes. This nutty pseudocereal grain stands up to robust flavors, but rinse it before cooking to remove the bitter germ. Carbs: 20g Fiber: 3g Protein: 4g Best in: Salads, stir-fries, pilaf with fresh herbs, shallots and garlic Keep Those Leftovers Grains including farro, quinoa and barley are good cold tossed in salads. Make a big batch to last three to four days in the fridge. 6. Buckwheat Drink Up If you’re increasing your fiber intake by eating more grains, be sure to also increase the amount of water you’re drinking to avoid any gastrointestinal discomfort, says Newell. Contrary to what its name indicates, buckwheat is not wheat but a grain-like seed. This plant is part of a class of pseudocereals that are consumed as grains but do not grow on grasses, similar to quinoa. Buckwheat is naturally gluten free, and its husk contains resistant starch that acts as a prebiotic for the good bacteria in your gut and may help prevent constipation and reduce cholesterol levels. Its slightly bitter, nutty flavor pairs well with mushrooms. Carbs: 17g Fiber: 2g Protein: 3g Best for: Knishes, blinis, hearty stews, toasted crisp for salads 7. Millet Another gluten-free grain, millet is a good option for those with celiac disease or who follow a gluten-free diet. Most notably, finger millet provides the most calcium of the cereal grains (about 344 mg per 100 grams), says Newell. Calcium has been shown to be beneficial to bone health, nerve function, and blood vessel and muscular contractions. Millet has a mild taste with a touch of sweetness and a slightly creamy texture. Carbs: 21g Fiber: 1g Protein: 3g Best for: Tabouli salads, a binder in veggie burgers, a swap for couscous Drink Up If you’re increasing your fiber intake by eating more grains, be sure to also increase the amount of water you’re drinking to avoid any gastrointestinal discomfort, says Newell. Kelsey Ogletree, an Alabama-based journalist, writes about travel and food for Conde Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure and the Wall Street Journal.​","The article explores the benefits of incorporating ancient grains into one's diet, providing alternatives to brown rice.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/food-swaps/,"6 Brilliant Diet Swaps How to lose weight (and get healthier) by making a few smart trades By Rachel Meltzer Warren AARP Comments En español Published January 13, 2020 Getty Images Eating healthier doesn't have to mean overhauling your diet. Making simple adjustments to the meals you eat every day can be an even better way to reach your wellness or weight-loss goals. Case in point: When researchers at the University of Colorado asked study participants to shoot for cutting just 100 calories a day, most ended up cutting out more like 300 calories over time, ending up with better results than following what the researchers called a more rigorous diet plan from the get-go. That could be because making, and keep, small diet changes can also help you feel successful so you're motivated to do more over time. And even easier than subtracting things from your diet: replacing one or two of your less nutritious go-to foods with better-for-you ones. Here are some trades to try: Instead of mayo … try mustard Mayo and mustard are both classic sandwich toppers. That's where the similarities end, though. Mayo supplies a lot of calories — one tablespoon has nearly 100 calories — and not much in the way of valuable nutrients. Then there's mustard. Made mainly of mustard seeds along with a liquid like water or vinegar and some spices and seasonings, prepared mustards provide around 10 calories per tablespoon. The condiment also supplies important nutrients like cell-protecting selenium; yellow mustards are made with the anti-inflammatory spice turmeric. If you're not ready to switch from mayo to mustard, try blending the two in equal parts to cut calories and saturated fat in half while adding nutrition to your sandwich. Instead of pretzels … try popcorn It's not unusual to crave a salty, crunchy snack. And there are plenty of healthier-looking options on the market, from sweet potato chips to veggie straws. You may have even switched to pretzels from a higher-fat choice like potato chips in an effort to do better. But the clear winner when you've got the munchies is homemade popcorn. Air-popped popcorn is a high-volume food with only around 120 calories per 4-cup serving, meaning you get a plentiful snack. You'll also get nearly 5 grams of filling fiber in that serving, making the choice satisfying, too. Spray it with a bit of olive oil followed by your favorite savory or sweet herbs and spices, such as Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute or any flavor of Mrs. Dash. Don't have an air popper? You can prep your popcorn on the stove in a pot with 2 tablespoons of oil per half-cup of popcorn kernels (just skip the spritz of oil after). Microwave and bagged popcorn can also be good choices; just look for one that has up to 150 calories and no more than 150 milligrams of sodium per serving. Instead of a flavored latte … try a plain one You probably know by now that experts recommend limiting the added sugar in your diet, both to stave off excess pounds and to protect your health. But what many people don't realize is how little added sugar authorities suggest we have. The American Heart Association says to keep added sugar intake to no more than 6 teaspoons per day for women, 9 teaspoons for men. Our average intake? More than double that amount. Drink one 16-ounce Starbucks Cinnamon Dolce Latte and you've nearly hit your limit for the day. Luckily, there's a an easy fix for that one. Keep the latte; skip the flavored syrup. You'll get the same creamy mouthfeel and warmth with none of the added sugar. For subtle sugar-free sweetness, try adding a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg instead. Instead of sour cream … try Greek yogurt The creamy tang of sour cream can taste great on a baked potato, contrasted with the sweetness of fruit, or in baked goods. But that flavor comes at a cost if you're looking to scale back on calories; each half-cup serving has around 230 calories along with nearly 6 grams of saturated fat. Full-fat Greek yogurt has a similar flavor to sour cream, but 100 fewer calories and half the saturated fat per serving. It's also a better source of bone-building calcium and blood pressure–lowering potassium than sour cream. You can generally use them interchangeably in recipes, though baking pros may notice a slightly drier texture when using the yogurt. Instead of granola … try fiber cereal For something that has a reputation as a health food, granola is a lot higher in added sugar and lower in valuable nutrients than you might think. And while many breakfast cereals provide a great opportunity to meet your recommended daily fiber goal — something an estimated 95 percent of Americans don't meet, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture — a half-cup serving of granola has only around 4 grams of it. Granola is also an energy-dense food; each half-cup has around 210 calories, making a great place to start if you're looking to cut back. For a similar crunch with far less sugar, nearly 100 fewer calories per serving, and more fiber, you can opt for a bowl of a high-fiber cereal like All-Bran. Most have a surprisingly sweet flavor and will get you much closer to your daily fiber goals — a ª-cup serving packs almost 12 grams, for only 103 calories and 6 grams of added sugars. Instead of rice … try cauliflower rice No, uber-trendy riced cauliflower is not a doppelganger for white rice. But it comes pretty darn close. There are a number of reasons those bags in the produce section and the freezer at your supermarket are worth a try. Just 9 percent of adults in the U.S. meet the recommendations for vegetable intake, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the same time, we're eating too many refined carbs. Swapping a serving of white rice for a serving of riced cauliflower can help you do a little better on both counts. It can also help you cut calories and carbohydrates. Pick up a bag and use it to make healthier twists on typically carb-y foods like fried rice, rice and beans, and more. Instead of ground beef … try a mix of beef and mushrooms You may not be open to trading your regular burger for a veggie version. But you can cut back on the amount of red meat you're eating by replacing up to half the ground beef in your recipe with chopped raw or roasted mushrooms — all without diminishing the flavor of your favorite Friday-night meal. Not only will you cut back on saturated fat and calories; you'll also add nutrients like fiber, riboflavin and more. Using the chopped mushroom trick provides more than just nutrition benefits, it turns out. The umami or savory taste in mushrooms actually enhances the flavor of meat dishes, according to research published in the Journal of Food Science. Mushrooms also add moisture, keeping even lower-fat ground beef from drying out. Use this trick with any meat-based burger, meatball or meat loaf recipe.","The article explores simple diet swaps that can lead to weight loss and improved health. Key recommendations include replacing mayo with mustard, pretzels with popcorn, flavored lattes with plain ones, sour cream with Greek yogurt, granola with high-fiber cereal, rice with cauliflower rice, and ground beef with a mix of beef and mushrooms. A novel insight is that making small, incremental changes to one's diet can be more effective and sustainable than drastic overhauls, as demonstrated by a University of Colorado study where participants who aimed to cut 100 calories a day ended up cutting 300 calories.",46
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/flu-treatment/#comments_widget_id,"8 Doctor-Recommended Tips to Survive This Year’s Awful Flu Season Aging immune systems have a harder time fighting off influenza By Kimberly Goad, Updated February 14, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published October 03, 2022 / Updated February 14, 2025 Philip Dulian/Getty Images The U.S. is suffering through one of the worst flu seasons in years, which is unsettling news for older adults who are at much higher risk of becoming seriously ill from influenza than their younger counterparts. Outbreak tracking maps show that the vast majority of the country is experiencing high or very high levels of flu activity, and health experts say it’s not clear when infections will slow down. While flu activity typically peaks between December and February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it can stretch into April. Already, the CDC estimates that the current flu season has seen at least 24 million illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths from influenza, and the number of cases continues to climb. For plenty of people, a case of the flu is mostly mild. That is not true, however, as you age. The rate of flu hospitalizations among older adults towers over younger populations, the latest CDC data shows. “Even though people over 60 are less than 20 percent of the population, they account for over 80 percent of the serious complications of influenza,” says William Schaffner, M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. No matter your age, getting a flu shot can help keep you healthy — and while the ideal time is early fall, doctors say it’s not too late. More than half of the overall U.S. population has yet to receive this year’s flu shot, according to the CDC. Roughly 70 percent of older adults got the vaccine for the 2024-2025 season. Unfortunately, a flu shot isn’t foolproof. “So what you do when you get the flu turns out to be very important for this [over 60] age group,” Schaffner says. Emergency warning signs of flu complications If you experience any of the following, seek medical attention right away: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening chronic medical conditions Source: CDC Here are eight ways to hasten your recovery from the flu, and the warning signs of a severe infection you need to know. 1. Call your health care provider ASAP Not everyone who gets the flu needs to see their doctor, but people over 65 do. That’s because age itself — along with many other conditions that often come along in later years, such as diabetes and heart disease — puts you at risk for serious complications from the flu, namely pneumonia. “As we age, our immune system responds less vigorously than it does when we’re younger,” explains Stuart Ray, M.D., professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins Hospital. “Both antibodies and T cells play important roles in protecting against infection and severe disease from influenza. And those tend to decrease during late adulthood.” Your doctor will likely prescribe an antiviral medication that helps your body fight off the influenza virus. Research shows that taking an antiviral, like Tamiflu, at the first sign of the flu can reduce symptoms and shorten your bout of the flu by one day. Don’t postpone treatment With antivirals, time is of the essence. You should take them within 48 hours after symptoms kick in. “What we adults tend to do is say, ‘I’d rather not go to the doctor. Let’s see if I feel better tomorrow,’” Schaffner says. “When we get what we think is influenza, it’s important to contact our health care provider, because the sooner we get the treatment, the better the success of the treatment.” Emergency warning signs of flu complications If you experience any of the following, seek medical attention right away: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening chronic medical conditions Source: CDC Keep in mind: You don’t have to make an in-person appointment. Your doctor should be able to assess your symptoms virtually, and new, over-the-counter tests that check for influenza and COVID-19 make it easier to diagnose flu. Miss your 48-hour window? There’s still some benefit to taking an antiviral “beyond the 48 hours, but it diminishes day by day,” Schaffner says. 2. Stay home The flu is highly contagious, spreading through droplets in the air when you cough, sneeze or talk. And that’s true even before you feel fluish. According to the National Institute on Aging, people with the flu can spread it a day before and up to a week after feeling sick. Don’t leave home until your fever is gone The CDC recommends staying home until you’re fever-free — without the help of fever-reducing meds — for 24 hours. 3. Wash your hands Disease-causing germs are easily spread by dirty hands. You know the drill: Throughout the day, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with regular soap and water — antibacterial soaps have no added benefit, according to the CDC — for at least 20 seconds. Don’t expect alcohol-based hand sanitizer to get the job done Sure, in a pinch it’s better than nothing. But research shows that soap and water are far more effective than hand sanitizers in removing certain kinds of germs. That said, if you’re nowhere near a bar of soap and running water, reach for the hand sanitizer. Just make sure it contains at least 60 percent alcohol. 4. Drink plenty of fluids “It’s important to stay well-hydrated when you have a fever,” Ray says. “Hydration will also help alleviate general malaise.” To that end, keep a big glass of water on the nightstand — juice, broth, decaffeinated herbal tea all work, too. Don’t reach for that morning mug of coffee Same goes for any caffeinated beverage and also alcohol. All of these are dehydrating, which will slow your recovery. “Dehydration means you can’t get your secretions up,” Schaffner says. “It’s more difficult to mobilize [the secretions] out of your chest and cough them up, and that can predispose you to the development of pneumonia.” 5. Rinse and moisten your sinuses A neti pot is one way to clear out built-up mucus in your sinuses. (Make sure you read up on how to use them properly to avoid any potential health risks.) If you’re not comfortable using the little teapot-looking container, here’s another way to relieve congestion and keep your nasal passages moist. “A warm — not hot — shower will immerse you in warm moisture, and that will lubricate your mucous membranes, particularly if you can cup some warm water into your hands, snuffle that up into your nose, and then very gently blow your nose,” Schaffner suggests. Don’t use a humidifier If your humidifier is just-out-of-the-box brand new, that’s one thing. But if you’ve had yours for a while, it’s probably best to skip it, Schaffner says. “They’re usually not cleaned very well, so bacteria grows and suddenly you’re aerosolizing contaminated water.” 6. Consider over-the-counter pain relievers Acetaminophen and ibuprofen aren’t cures, but they can help reduce fever and alleviate aches and pains. Just “be sure to read the label carefully because these medications are not without risk — they can injure the liver, kidneys, intestines and cause other side effects — and these risks rise with age and complex health history,” Ray says. “Moreover, they don’t reduce the risk of hospitalization or death.” Don’t take decongestants Or at least not without consulting your health care provider. Here’s why: “Decongestants contain a combination of ingredients, some of which can increase your heart rate, even raise your blood pressure, and possibly interfere with sleep,” Schaffner says. 7. Stay physically active Forget what your mother said about staying in bed 24/7. “You have to listen to your body. But the more time you spend horizontal, the worse it is — physically and psychologically,” Schaffner says. Don’t overdo it That said, now is not the time to try for your personal best — for example, turning that daily power walk into a run or trying that hot yoga class you’ve been curious about. “Although gentle exercise, even just walking around, will make you feel better,” Schaffner says. 8. Pay attention to symptoms If your symptoms are getting progressively worse — you’ve got chest pain, your temperature is going up, you’re coughing up yellow phlegm — call your doctor, “particularly if you have any underlying illnesses and you’re worse today than you were yesterday,” Schaffner says. Don’t try to tough it out on your own You may be in the early stages of pneumonia, the most common complication of the flu. It can cause severe illness in people of every age, but older adults are among the most vulnerable. ﻿Research published in 2018 found that more than ﻿1 in 6 adults 65 and older who are hospitalized with pneumonia die from the infection.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/organic-food/#comments_widget_id,"What You Need to Know About Organic Food 2 experts weigh in on the benefits of locally grown and the cost trade-offs By Mark Bittman and David L. Katz AARP Comments En español Published March 03, 2020 Keith Brofsky/Getty Images Does any old apple a day keep the doctor away? Or does it have to be organic? The answer is, honestly, “That's impossible to say right now.” Why is that? First of all, almost nobody eats purely organic versus purely nonorganic, so it's impossible to divide people into two groups for comparison. There's an overlap, and when two groups that are supposed to be different are a bit alike, their outcomes look more like one another. So there's no evidence that organic foods are better for you? We didn't say that. There is a burgeoning array of large observational studies that look at people who reported willfully eating organic routinely versus people who didn't. As of this writing, the most recent study is out of France, where researchers found a significant difference in cancer incidence between those who eat organic routinely versus those who don't. (Those people who ate organic most often had the least cancer, as you'd expect.) Well, doesn't that mean that organic is better after all, if it keeps you from getting cancer? The study really isn't conclusive, though. Aaargh. Why not? Maybe what makes the two groups different is the total level of care they take with their health. It could be that all those people eating organic have access to better medical care, more cash to spend, higher quality of life — that kind of thing. Generally, organic food costs more, which means more well-to-do people — those with better health care and usually better living situations — are more likely to be the ones eating better. So we still don't know for sure. But at least, for the first time, we have a strong association between routine consumption of organic food and an important health outcome. Sue Tallon If I'm looking at organic and nonorganic apples side by side at a store and I can't afford the organic ones, what should I do? A nonorganic apple is better than no apple and better than most other choices. Rinsing conventionally grown produce reduces the pesticide residue and so arguably narrows the difference between organic and not organic. So, yes, get the nonorganic apples and wash them well. It's almost safe to say, “Never pass up an apple.” What about trying to eat locally? ""Locavore” is a relatively new term but an ancient way of eating. Locavores eat — or try to eat — food produced locally, although, of course, the word “local” is pretty vague. Before food was shipped, everyone was a locavore. Now the term has come to have a deeper meaning: that what you eat matters to your health, and the quality and composition of what you eat are in turn determined by how the food is raised, what it's fed and where it's from. Sue Tallon Don't Panic, Eat Organic Since 2004, the Environmental Working Group has been publishing the Dirty Dozen, its annual list of fruits and vegetables most likely to contain pesticide residue, even after being washed. If you're choosing to buy some organic produce, these are the ones to prioritize. Strawberries Spinach Kale Nectarines Apples Grapes Peaches Cherries Pears Tomatoes Celery Potatoes Why is it worth spending extra time and, usually, money to eat locally? Reducing the carbon footprint, supporting local economies, eating seasonally (and fresh), knowing where your food comes from and how it was raised … all these are inarguably positive attributes, and all are characteristics of local food. No one but a fanatic could eat only local food, but concentrating on these attributes would mean you were eating better, more ethically, more sustainably. If you know your produce is being grown on a local farm where chemicals are not being used, you know that you are avoiding those chemicals. If you know the soil is being nurtured appropriately, you know it's rich in nutrients. If your food has not been in storage and transit for days or weeks, it will have much more of its native nutrient content when you eat it. So local sourcing means the foods have better nutrient composition? In general, yes; though if you're sourcing industrially produced corn locally, then probably not. It makes sense that agriculture and health are connected — there's no way around it. So the more you know about how and where plants are grown, the more confident you can be about their nutrient quality. Does soil composition affect animal products, too? Oh yeah. This issue is even more important when you consider animal foods. The nutrient composition of meat is substantially connected with the diet and exercise pattern of the animal. Meat is leaner and has less saturated fat when animals get more exercise, for instance. The composition of meat also varies with what animals eat and the nutrients in those plants, which are in turn influenced by the soil. Sue Tallon Sue Tallon Don't Panic, Eat Organic Since 2004, the Environmental Working Group has been publishing the Dirty Dozen, its annual list of fruits and vegetables most likely to contain pesticide residue, even after being washed. If you're choosing to buy some organic produce, these are the ones to prioritize. Strawberries Spinach Kale Nectarines Apples Grapes Peaches Cherries Pears Tomatoes Celery Potatoes Healthy, nutritious soil means healthy, nutritious meat? When animals graze on grass, as opposed to grains, they keep the soil healthy and produce better meat. And pasture-raised animals may have lower risks of industrial foodborne scourges like E. coli O157:H7, a strain that can cause severe infection and even kidney failure. It came from the intestines of cattle, particularly those that were fed grain rather than grass! So if animal rights and environmentalist arguments don't motivate you to eat local, remember that it also matters to your personal health. Having said that, it is, of course, possible to produce bad or nutritionally deficient food locally. But a main advantage of sourcing locally is that you can see or learn about the production of your food and easily make that judgment. It's also pretty safe to say that a locavore diet does not include nationally distributed food products made in a factory somewhere, which pretty much means it excludes junk food. Does that mean locavores can eat whatever they want? Grass-fed burgers and locally produced cheese all day! Not exactly. It's still important to have a plant-predominant diet, along with balance and variety. Adapted from How to Eat: All Your Food and Diet Questions Answered by Mark Bittman and David L. Katz, M.D., published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Used by permission.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 clear sentences:

The article explores the benefits and trade-offs of eating organic and locally grown food, with experts Mark Bittman and David L. Katz weighing in on the topic. While there is no conclusive evidence that organic food is better for you, a recent French study found a significant association between routine consumption of organic food and lower cancer incidence. Eating locally grown food, on the other hand, has several benefits, including reducing carbon footprint, supporting local economies, and ensuring fresher, more nutritious produce. A key takeaway is that while it's not necessary to eat only organic or local food, prioritizing certain produce, such as those on the Environmental Working Group's ""Dirty Dozen"" list, and being mindful of food sourcing can lead to a healthier and more sustainable diet.",48
https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/light-affects-sleep-health/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series Even a Small Amount of Light While You Sleep May Harm Your Health Light exposure while you sleep leads to an elevated heart rate and higher insulin resistance, study finds Enes Evren / Getty Images By: Michelle Crouch, AARP En español Published April 15, 2022 4 Stretches to Help You Sleep Better - AARP You’ve probably heard that keeping your bedroom dark can help improve the quality of your sleep. But new research reveals that eliminating artificial light during the night — from a TV set or radio clock or streetlight — could also have a positive impact on your heart and blood sugar levels. In an intriguing new study, Northwestern University researchers found that adults exposed to even a moderate amount of light while they slept experienced higher heart rates compared to when they slept in a very dark room. They also had more insulin resistance in the morning, which meant their bodies had to work harder to regulate their blood sugar, the study showed. Surprisingly, the study subjects who were exposed to the light didn’t report any trouble sleeping. “The upshot is, it appears that light during sleep is affecting you, even if you’re not aware of it,” says study coauthor Phyllis Zee, M.D., director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “Your subconscious is aware that there’s light and there’s something going on, and it’s keeping you a little bit on watch. Your fight-or-flight system is more activated.” Elevated heart rate and insulin resistance are risk factors for heart disease and early death. The study is important because it highlights a factor you can control that could improve your health and lower your long-term health risk, Zee says. Effects of light exposure Previous studies have linked light exposure at night to a variety of health problems, including an increased risk of depression, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. In addition, a large study of 43,722 women published in 2019 found that those who slept with artificial light had a higher risk of gaining weight and being obese than those who slept in a dark room. ﻿ ﻿In light of that research, Zee says she wanted to design a controlled study to examine what happens to your body physiologically when you are exposed to light while you sleep. 4 Stretches to Help You Sleep Better - AARP She recruited a group of 20 young adults to spend two nights in her sleep lab and divided them into two groups. Both groups slept in a dark room on the first night. On the second night, the control group again slept in the dark room, but the other group spent the night in a room with moderate light exposure — about equal to that of a streetlight outside or a hallway light left on. While the control group showed little change from the first night, the group exposed to light had higher heart rates and a significant increase in their insulin resistance levels compared to the night they slept in a darker environment. “What’s new and novel about our work is that it’s giving us a clue about the mechanism — how light exposure during sleep could lead to metabolic disorders,” Zee says. Eyelids aren’t designed to filter out light Although the study was conducted on young people, Zee says her hunch is that the effect on older adults may be even more prominent. “That’s a population already at risk for insulin resistance,” she says. “It will be very interesting to do these types of studies with older adults because many institutions, like nursing homes, keep the lights on for safety reasons.” Kristin Daley, a psychologist and sleep medicine expert who chairs the clinical practice committee for the Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine, says the study offers more evidence that it’s best to sleep in complete darkness if possible — a contention she and other sleep clinicians have been making for years. “The problem is, our eyelids are not designed to filter out light,” she says. “We all have receptors in back of our retinas that pick up light even when our eyes are closed.” Your bedroom may not be as dark as you think Even if you believe your room is dark, you may be exposed to more light than you realize. Glowing electronic devices, like cable boxes, USB chargers and even your alarm clock, can light up a whole room, Daley says. Daley suggests conducting this test in your bedroom at night: Close the door, turn off the lights, let your eyes adjust to the darkness for a minute or so and hold out your hand in front of you. ﻿ “If you can still see your hand 24 inches away from face, you have too much ambient light,” Daley says. “I have all my patients do this, and it’s funny how many come back and say, ‘Holy cow! I had so much light in my room.’ Their perception was that it was really dark.” Block LED lights on electronic devices with tape or by covering them, and turn your alarm clock around, Daley suggests. If you live in an urban area, you may need to get room-darkening curtains or shades to fully block the shine from streetlights outside. What if you get up during the night? Many older adults keep a light on at night because they have to get up and use the bathroom, and they want to be able to see where they’re going to prevent falls. If that’s the case, Daley recommends keeping a flashlight on your bedside table and using it to light the way if you visit the bathroom. “It trains the light away from your eye [as opposed to a nightlight, which] direct﻿s the light toward your eye,” she explains. If you prefer to use a nightlight, Zee suggests plugging it in as close to the floor if possible. You may also want to cover it with a red light filter, since studies show red or orange light is less likely than white and blue light to affect brain activity. “I’m not saying you have to sleep in total darkness, because I understand that may not be possible for some people,” Zee says. “The goal is to minimize light exposure and yet create a safe environment.” Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

It depends on what hurts — and why. ﻿ “If you can target the pain with a medication that treats the underlying cause, the pain relief will be better,” says Sunny Linnebur, a professor at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora. ﻿ Although your specific health conditions can alter the equation, here’s a general look at what’s best for what ails you. 1. Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Midol), Naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, Naprelan) What it is/What they are: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) that reduce fever and block prostaglandins, compounds that cause pain and inflammation Best for: Headaches, musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, toothaches, backaches, sunburn. These are safer choices than aspirin for those with bleeding risks. Don’t use for: Nerve pain Avoid if: You take blood thinners or have uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart failure, or a history of ulcers or liver or kidney disease. 2. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, FeverAll, Panadol) What it is/What they are: An analgesic and antifever medication that works in the brain to reduce mild to moderate pain by changing the way the body senses pain Best for: Headaches, muscle aches, sore throat, toothaches, backaches, and sprains and strains. Best painkiller for people with GI issues Don’t use for: Nerve pain or inflammatory conditions like arthritis Avoid if: You are a heavy drinker. Take no more than 4,000 mg daily to avoid liver issues. 3. Aspirin What it is/What they are: An NSAID that stops the production of prostaglandins, which cause pain and inflammation. It also reduces fever and blood clotting. Best for: Headaches, arthritis, toothaches, muscle aches, sprains, strains. It’s also the only NSAID that reduces heart attack and stroke risk, though adults 60 and older should not start an aspirin regimen to lower their risk of a first heart attack or stroke, new guidelines say. Don’t use for: Wounds or bruises (aspirin may promote bleeding) or nerve pain (it just won’t touch it) Avoid if: You take blood thinners or have uncontrolled high blood pressure, kidney disease, or ulcers or other bleeding risks. 4. Topical pain relievers What it is/What they are: Anesthetics that temporarily relieve pain at the skin’s surface. A topical NSAID called diclofenac sodium topical gel 1 percent can be effective for joint pain. Best for: Neuropathic pain, nerve pain, sunburn, joint pain and soft-tissue injuries Don’t use for: Wounds, open sores, headaches, toothaches Avoid if: You are allergic to lidocaine. If you have liver or heart issues, don’t use the medication without consulting your doctor. ﻿Don’t forget to talk to your doctor about the medications you are taking — even the over-the-counter variety. Just because they are available without a prescription doesn’t mean they are free of potentially harmful side effects and drug interactions.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/stomach-ulcer-symptoms-causes-treatments/,"5 Warning Signs of Ulcers Symptoms to look for in this common ailment that can be dangerous if left untreated nazarkru / Getty Images By Michelle Crouch, AARP En español Published March 15, 2023 Did you know that the acid and enzymes in your stomach are so powerful that studies show they can dissolve metal items such as coins and razor blades? Imagine if those fluids started eating away at your organs. That’s what happens when you have a peptic ulcer, a painful sore that develops in the lining of your stomach or small intestine. As many as 1 in 10 people worldwide will have an ulcer, according to a 2022 study published in the journal PLoS One. Normally, a special mucus membrane keeps digestive fluids away from the surface of your stomach and intestine. Ulcers form when that barrier is damaged or overwhelmed, allowing acid to leak through. Doctors used to believe that emotional stress alone could cause ulcers, but they now know that’s not the case. Though stress is associated with an increased risk of ulcers, experts say most are caused by one of two triggers: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria: Thirty to 40 percent of people in the United States have this bacterium living in their stomach, often without any obvious symptoms. H. pylori can break down the protective lining in the stomach. Scientists don’t know exactly what percentage of stomach ulcers are linked to H. pylori, but the Cleveland Clinic estimates 40 percent. Overuse of certain pain medications: The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at high doses or over a prolonged period increases your risk of ulcers. The medications can irritate and thin your stomach lining and interfere with your body’s ability to repair damage to the area. Researchers estimate half of stomach ulcers are caused by NSAID overuse, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve), ketorolac (Toradol) and oxaprozin (Daypro). Ulcer causes often overlap, experts say. Being infected with the bacteria makes it much more likely that an NSAID will degrade your stomach lining. Older adults at higher risk Anyone can get an ulcer, but your risk increases with age, experts say. That’s partly because H. pylori infections are more common in older adults, says gastroenterologist Nimish Vakil, a professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Research shows that relative to other birth cohorts, people born in the 1940s and 1950s have a higher prevalence of H. pylori, according to a Japanese study. Older people are more likely to use NSAIDs, whether it’s daily low-dose aspirin for a heart condition or ibuprofen to relieve pain from arthritis, says ﻿Ekta Gupta, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine.﻿ Peptic ulcer symptoms Gupta says early ulcer symptoms can be subtle, “so it’s important to be mindful and aware of the signs.” If left untreated, ulcers can cause complications including a hole in the stomach lining, a blockage in your intestines, stomach cancer or life-threatening internal bleeding. Worried you might have an ulcer? Here are the symptoms to look for: 1. Burning pain in the upper abdomen The classic symptom of a peptic ulcer is gnawing or burning pain above the belly button. The pain is typically worse at night or on an empty stomach, but not always. “Often, patients report it gets better if they eat something,” Gupta says. The pain usually comes and goes for several days or weeks. Taking antacids may help temporarily, but the pain will keep coming back. 2. Bloating, fullness or loss of appetite When you have an ulcer, inflammation causes the lining of your stomach to thicken, leaving less room for food, says﻿ Tinka Barnes, a family medicine staff physician at Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a result, some patients say they feel like their stomach is distended or that they fill up quickly when they eat. “You’re not able to take in as much,” Barnes says. 3. Nausea and vomiting Although less common, ulcers can make you feel sick to your stomach, especially if you haven’t eaten in a while. 4. Fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin color Left untreated, peptic ulcers can start to bleed. The slow loss of blood can cause anemia, or iron deficiency. In some cases, anemia symptoms such as fatigue, pale skin and shortness of breath with exercise can be the first signs of a bleeding ulcer. 5. Bloody or dark stool, bloody vomit Sometimes, an ulcer causes severe bleeding, and that’s a medical emergency. Signs that an ulcer is bleeding heavily include: stool that looks jet black, that seems sticky or that has dark red blood mixed in; bloody vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds; and dizziness, fainting or light-headedness. If you experience any of those symptoms, you should call 911 or head for the nearest emergency room. Diagnosis and treatment If your medical provider suspects an ulcer, he or she may conduct tests to see if you are infected with H. pylori. In many cases, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. Treatment typically includes medications to block acid production such as proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers. If H. pylori is the culprit, you may also need to take a course of antibiotics. Most ulcers can be treated and will heal after several weeks. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/junk-food-addiction/,"Are You Addicted to Junk Food? 1 in 8 older adults are hooked on ultraprocessed food. Here’s how it's affecting your brain and body By Rachel Nania, Updated May 09, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published November 03, 2023 / Updated May 09, 2024 DOUG CHAYKA Michael Prager doesn’t go near junk food. After he eats a frozen pizza, candy bar or packaged pastry, his head will throb. A sheen of sweat will appear on his face and body. Then, a craving will hit. “When my body has finally gone through it all, it starts saying, Hey, why can’t I have some more? Let’s have some more. Let’s have some more,” he says. Prager, 65, a retired journalist and author in Arlington, Massachusetts, is not alone. One in 8 adults ages 50 to 80 show signs of addiction to ultraprocessed foods, or what we call junk food — sugary sodas, salty chips and fatty fast food — according to a 2023 report from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, sponsored by AARP. Nearly half of older adults experience at least one symptom of junk food addiction, such as intense cravings, an inability to stop eating once they start, or withdrawal symptoms when they try to resist. “In the same way that taking that first sip of alcohol can prime [some people] to want more,­ we see that same thing with these foods,” says Ashley Gearhardt, a coauthor on the poll and director of the Food and Addiction Science & Treatment Lab at the University of Michigan. Addictive by design﻿ Minimally Processed Foods Ste﻿el-cut oats Salmon filet Barley Fresh fruit Potatoes Highly Processed Foods Sugary cereal Frozen fish sticks Canned ravioli Fruit juice Baked potato chips Nearly all foods go through some level of processing — beans are dried or canned; spinach is washed and bagged. But the term “ultraprocessed” refers to foods that have been altered by the addition of super-flavoring agents to create irresistible tastes; preservatives to prolong shelf life; food dyes to alter hues; and refined fats and carbohydrates that have been stripped of fiber and other nutrients to improve their texture and appearance. Sweet, salty, crunchy, creamy fare: From candy bars to chips, from cookies to pastries, these foods have been created to be hyper-palatable so that you’ll come back for more. And it’s easy to do just that, considering they’re all around us. They line checkout counters in gas stations and grocery stores, and they’re stuffed in vending machines at high schools and hospitals. “Basically, the whole environment is set up to induce craving [junk food],” says Alexandra DiFeliceantonio, a neuroscientist at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, who studies how the brain guides our food choices. And they’re cheap. “Healthy food is so much more expensive, and there are people who can’t afford it,” says addiction specialist Nora Volkow, M.D., director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Federal data shows that nearly 19 million people in the U.S. lack access to fresh, healthy foods. “If you don’t have any choices, what do you do?” Volkow says. Minimally Processed Foods Ste﻿el-cut oats Salmon filet Barley Fresh fruit Potatoes Highly Processed Foods Sugary cereal Frozen fish sticks Canned ravioli Fruit juice Baked potato chips The ultraprocessed body Today, almost 60 percent of the calories consumed by Americans comes from ultraprocessed food. That figure may help explain why the U.S. has the world’s highest obesity rate among high-income countries. A pivotal 2019 study from the National Institutes of Health found that participants who ate a diet chock full of processed foods — packaged muffins, frozen fish sticks and canned ravioli — ended up eating more food and gaining more weight in a two-week window than participants on a more natural diet — oats, fish filets and barley — even though the meals and snacks prepared contained a similar number of calories and other nutrients. And a study in 2023 found that even when people eat the same number of calories, those who eat ultraprocessed foods over high-fiber foods absorb more calories — an average of 116 additional calories per day. One reason: Our gut microbiomes, made up of the microorganisms living in our digestive tracts, consume calories too, but ultraprocessed foods are digested so quickly that their calories never make it to the large intestine, home of the microbiome. Some experts suspect that the chemical additives in ultraprocessed foods cause disruptions in the microbiome and in the hormone-creating endocrine system as well, potentially explaining the link between these foods and weight gain. Your brain on junk food 5 Signs of Junk Food Addiction Intense cravings Inability to resist certain foods Feeling sluggish or tired from overeating Signs of withdraw (headaches, irritability, etc.) when you abstain Feeling like you need more in order to get the same effect﻿ The brain is hardwired to favor high-calorie foods — it’s an evolutionary trait that helped keep humans alive long before the age of grocery stores. The smell or taste of something sweet or fatty floods the body with feel-good chemicals like dopamine, Gearhardt says. But, she adds, that system was designed to get us to eat more nutrient-dense foods, like olives and raspberries. “Our brain never evolved to handle foods like those that dominate the current food environment,” she says. That’s because refined carbs and fat found in highly processed foods — and often found in combination — trigger a release of dopamine at levels that surpass what is seen when, say, an apple is digested. In fact, several experts in the field say the response is more like what we see with nicotine and alcohol. “The speed in which a substance hits your body is really key in determining its addictive potential,” Gearhardt explains. And because many ultraprocessed foods lack protein, fiber and water, they can be devoured and digested quickly, rushing the reward. Curbing the cravings As with alcohol, cigarettes, even some drugs, not everyone who indulges in junk food becomes addicted. “We’ve learned a lot about what addiction is over the last 20 years, and it isn’t something that you either have or you don’t have. It’s more of a continuum,” says Nicole Avena, a food addiction expert and associate professor of neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. 5 Signs of Junk Food Addiction Intense cravings Inability to resist certain foods Feeling sluggish or tired from overeating Signs of withdraw (headaches, irritability, etc.) when you abstain Feeling like you need more in order to get the same effect﻿ Still, it doesn’t take a serious addiction to experience the negative health effects of junk food. “While it might not be taking over your life, it only takes about 200 or 300 extra calories a day to see risk for excessive weight gain and diet-related disease,” Gearhardt says. These foods have also been linked to numerous health issues that plague the 50-plus population, including diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. For people looking to dial back their intake, small steps can make a big impact: Urge surf. Cravings build, but they eventually peak and peter out — just like a wave, says Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist psychologist Shenelle A. Edwards-Hampton. Next time you get a craving, try waiting it out. “Over time, the height of the waves will get lower, and they’ll come fewer and farther between,” she adds. Avoid triggers. Become aware of what environments or situations trigger your food cravings, such as binge-watching TV, and if possible, avoid them. Pursue convenience. Packaged doesn’t have to mean unhealthy. Lentils come pre-steamed; brown rice can be cooked in one minute in the microwave. “You could put those together, and that’s a meal,” says Kristin Kirkpatrick, a dietician at the Cleveland Clinic. Canned beans, frozen vegetables and frozen fruit are other healthy shortcuts. Don’t skip meals. Hunger will make you more vulnerable to cravings. So will giving up foods you enjoy. Aim for three minimally processed meals a day, Gearhardt says, and make sure the foods on your plate are ones you like. “It’s about finding pleasure from your food, just not in such a jacked-up way,” she adds. While difficult, overcoming a more severe addiction to junk food is possible. Support groups like Overeaters Anonymous can benefit some, Gearhardt says. So can cognitive behavioral therapy, a type of psychotherapy that emphasizes coping skills, and nutritional counseling, which can help map out healthy alternatives to ultraprocessed foods. And then there’s abstinence. That’s what eventually worked for Prager, who, along with seeking therapy, decided to cut out refined sugar and flour. “My life without [junk food] is just so much better,” he says. “I do not feel deprived. I feel lucky that I know that there’s something that doesn't work for me, and that when I avoid it, I’m happier.” Are all ultraprocessed foods equal? There’s no doubt that limiting your intake of ultraprocessed foods can help your health. But a new observational study suggests that not all ultraprocessed foods are created equal, and some foods may be more of a hazard than others. Research published May 8 in the journal BMJ found that people who had a higher intake of processed foods had a higher risk of dying early, compared with people who ate the least amount of processed foods. And certain foods were more associated with this increased risk, including: Processed meats Dairy-based desserts Sugary cereals and other processed breakfast foods Sugary and artificially sweetened beverages Are all ultraprocessed foods equal?

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/dehydration-in-older-people/,"Extreme Heat View Series 8 Signs of Dehydration You Shouldn’t Ignore Know the signals you may have waited a bit too long to drink up — and why it matters By Michelle Crouch, Updated June 19, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published August 19, 2021 / Updated June 19, 2024 Woman drinks water at Deer Park viewpoint overlooking The Olympic Mountain Range. Getty Images Dehydration may seem like something that happens to extreme athletes or someone who has a gastrointestinal illness. But doctors say it is a very real risk for all adults over age 65. As you get older, your sense of thirst is blunted, so you may not recognize your body’s need for fluids, says Ardeshir Hashmi, M.D., section chief of the Center for Geriatric Medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “On a warm or hot day, without even sensing it, you’re losing a ton of fluid,” he says. “In older adults, the same level of dehydration that normally triggers a thirst response may not. The thirst mechanism goes down drastically, especially after age 80.” Other factors also put older adults at higher risk. The body’s ability to retain water in blood vessels decreases with age, so fluids are more easily depleted. If you suffer from diabetes or take diuretics, both can contribute to water loss. What’s more, older adults with urinary incontinence may intentionally reduce their fluid intake or take medications to try to avoid accidents. And those experiencing cognitive decline may get dehydrated simply because they forget to drink, says Hal Atkinson, M.D., a professor of geriatric medicine at the Wake Forest School of Medicine. Risks of dehydration — and how fever factors in Unchecked, dehydration can have grave consequences, doctors say. It can cause confusion and weakness or prompt your blood pressure to drop so dramatically that you get dizzy, fall and break a bone. Or you can go into hypovolemic shock, when your blood pressure gets so low that your heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body. “Water is life,” says Atkinson. “When you have too little fluid in the body, it can affect a lot of different organ systems, because your body is 60 percent fluid.” It’s especially important to be on alert for dehydration if you or a loved one is sick. While most people know that diarrhea and vomiting cause fluid loss, you may not realize that a high fever is also a risk factor. In addition, some sedating medications can lead to dehydration because they reduce your body’s drive to drink. So how can you tell if you or someone you care about is getting dehydrated? Here are the signs and symptoms to watch for: 1. Thirst If you feel thirsty, you’re probably already a bit dehydrated, especially if you are age 65 or older. “The amount of dehydration required for that sense of thirst to kick in is going to happen a lot later than when you were younger,” Hashmi explains. Even if you don’t feel thirsty, older adults should drink throughout the day, he advises. Aim for at least 48 ounces of fluid (six 8-ounce glasses) a day – and more if you’re physically active. Juices, sports drinks, noncaffeinated sodas and flavored waters or seltzers all count toward your fluid intake, Hashmi says. You can also boost your intake with foods containing a lot of water such as soups, watermelon and cucumber. 2. Dark urine The more fluid in your body, the clearer your urine will be. Your urine should be “almost the same color as tap water if you’re well hydrated,” Hashmi says. If your urine turns a dark yellow or brownish color, or if it has a stronger odor than normal, that’s likely an early sign of dehydration, and you need to drink more water. 3. Dizziness or fainting Although dizziness can be a symptom of many different conditions, it is a classic sign of dehydration, Atkinson says. When you’re dehydrated, you don’t have enough fluid in your blood vessels. You feel dizzy because “you’re not getting as much blood flow to the brain,” he explains. You’re most likely to feel dizzy when you sit up after lying down, or stand up from sitting. If the blood flow to your brain drops significantly, you may notice a darkness in front of your eyes, Hashmi says. That may be a sign you’re about to pass out from dehydration. 4. Muscle cramps or weakness Another sign of dehydration is a feeling of weakness in certain muscles or severe muscle cramps. The cramps can be caused by electrolyte imbalances and reduced blood flow to those muscles. Cramps can happen while you’re exercising, or you may wake up in the middle of the night with cramping in your calf muscles. “It can be severe enough that it won’t let you sleep,” Hashmi says. 5. Constipation or less frequent urination Water helps flush toxins out of your body and keeps your digestive system running smoothly. If you’re adequately hydrating, you should be urinating every two or three hours and having regular bowel movements, Hashmi says. “If you’re not going to the bathroom the usual number of times, that can indicate a problem,” he says. 6. Dry skin or lack of skin elasticity Dehydration causes skin to be dry and look sunken in some areas, such as under your eyes. Your skin will also have less elasticity than normal. If you are caring for someone who is frail, one way to tell if they are getting dehydrated is to gently pinch or press the skin on their arm. “When you touch their skin, it may not spring back as easily as before,” Atkinson says. “It can be very pronounced.” 7. Dry mouth Dehydration also reduces saliva production. If you suspect someone is dehydrated, pay attention to the inside of their mouth, Atkinson says. “Their tongue should have a glisten to it,” he says. “In extreme [dehydration] cases, you may notice sores in their mouth that go along with not having enough fluid.” 8. Fatigue, headache or confusion Low blood flow due to dehydration can cause a headache, tiredness and weakness. Or you may just feel a little less sharp than usual. If you’re a caregiver for someone who seems confused, don’t rule out dehydration as a cause, Hashmi says: “A lot of things can cause confusion; maybe Mom or Dad has an infection. But it could also be that they’re getting dehydrated, and their blood pressure has dropped. Sometimes when we give them fluid, it’s amazing what happens.” Editor’s note: This story, first published Aug. 19, 2021, has been updated to include new information. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/brain-fitness-test-assessment/,"Test Your Brain Fitness What a simple battery of tasks can — and cannot — tell about cognition By Martin J. Kernan, AARP Comments En español Published November 10, 2023 Kyle Ellingson Banana. Sunrise. Chair. Read these three words aloud and commit them to memory. If you can recall them by the end of this article, then you’ve passed a standard test doctors use to check brain fitness. AARP The Magazine Special Edition AARP takes a look at how aging has evolved and improved over the decades — and how it likely will change in the years ahead. Read more stories from the Age Issue While modern science has proven excellent at coming up with ways to test, measure and treat a huge range of illnesses, it continues to struggle to find a test or treatment for Alzheimer’s and other age-related brain disorders. But there’s one area of progress: We now have a series of tools that can roughly quantify just how well we’re holding up, mentally. The four brain assessment tests most commonly used don’t measure intelligence or whether you are at peak mental performance. Rather, they test the lower end of your brain function, with the goal of pointing out early signs of impaired thinking or declining mental capabilities that need further scrutiny. They test skills like memory, spatial perception, attention and the ability to plan and make decisions — known as executive function — all of which can decline with age. “If someone is concerned about their cognition or people close to them are concerned, then that person should have an evaluation,” says Soo Borson, M.D., professor of clinical family medicine at the University of Southern California. Borson created the Mini-Cog, a widely used cognitive assessment that takes under three minutes to complete and involves just two tasks: a three-word recall and a clock drawing test. Other common cognitive assessment tests are MoCA and SAGE. XpressO, a digital version of MoCA, will be released this fall. MoCA is the most rigorous of them all, and perhaps best suited for people with higher education levels. But it’s still a simple test, with just 30 questions, and it takes only about 15 minutes to complete. It is “by no means a sufficient measure of cognitive capacity for complex real-world tasks such as driving or leading a powerful nation,” says neurologist Hyun-Sik Yang, M.D., of Harvard Medical School. And none of these tests can offer a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s or other impairments. But what they can do is establish a baseline of one’s cognitive functioning, which can then be tracked over time. A change in score could mean that more extensive testing, like brain scans or blood tests, is needed. Medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies and certain illnesses can also cause poor performance on cognitive tests. More thorough examinations rule those out. Medicare covers cognitive testing as part of the annual wellness checkup for people 65 and older with Medicare Part B. But only 1 in 4 Medicare recipients typically take the test. Borson and others think these numbers will improve now that there are new drugs to treat dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. Here are seven common challenges found in these assessments. Kyle Ellingson 1. Draw a clock face. The clock drawing exercise is a standard part of many of these exams. On a blank sheet of paper, draw an analog clock with hands showing a certain time, for example, 4:03. Sounds easy, right? Take a moment to draw yours. Kyle Ellingson Having to recall and draw a clock face offers clues about a person’s ability to understand, plan, concentrate and more. The left attempt here get﻿s full credit, because all 12 numbers are placed in proper sequence and position. Plus, the hands are pointing to the correct time. The other two clocks tell a different story. These test-takers have some cognitive deficits. Perhaps they couldn’t understand the instructions or were struggling to recall the structure of a clock and the numbers on its face. Those who placed the numbers and hands in the wrong places may have trouble judging spatial relationships. Executive functioning problems would’ve made it hard to think abstractly, plan and concentrate — all of which are necessary to successfully depict this familiar timepiece. Kyle Ellingson 2. Follow the trail. In this test you connect alternating letters and numbers in ascending order; for example, you would go from A to 1 to B to 2 and so on. Putting two sets of unrelated symbols in a logical sequence engages brain circuits that regulate thoughts and action, which is part of executive functioning, says neurologist Ziad Nasreddine M.D., creator of the MoCA test. Kyle Ellingson 3. Word retrieval. The test-taker is asked to name a few things that don’t ordinarily come up in conversation. Two examples appear above. Most of us don’t run into a rhinoceros every day or bump into a harp in the hallway. So it may take a second to retrieve the word. Getting that familiar “it’s on the tip of my tongue” feeling happens to everyone from time to time. Draw a blank routinely enough, though, and a doctor may wish to examine your language and memory functions in depth. Kyle Ellingson 4. Place your right hand on your left knee. Expressing language is one thing; comprehending it is another. Responding to this simple command tests your comprehension. Kyle Ellingson 5. What’s left in your wallet? For a more analytical challenge, try a question reminiscent of elementary school math: You have $100 and you go to the store and buy a dozen apples for $3 and a tricycle for $20. How much did you spend? How much do you have left? Problems with simple calculations can signal a threat to one’s brain — and bank account. This challenge can identify people who’ve lost the higher-level thinking abilities that basic arithmetic requires. Kyle Ellingson Kyle Ellingson Kyle Ellingson Kyle Ellingson Kyle Ellingson 6. Count backward from 100 by seven. For some of us, subtraction never came easy. So struggling here wouldn’t raise a red flag. But maybe you were always a math whiz and now struggle. If so, it’s worth checking out. Kyle Ellingson 7. Recall time. Finally, what were those three words from the top of the story? (No cheating.) If those words don’t come to mind, don’t worry. Your brain may be fine. Missing a question or two doesn’t mean your cognitive powers are failing. It may just be a sign of poor sleep, stress or a multitude of other causes that are fixable and have nothing to do with age-related brain diseases. Nor does getting all the questions right or scoring perfectly on any of the assessments mean that you’re a genius. There are different tests for that. So while cognitive testing isn’t going to tell us which presidential candidates are best for the job, MoCA’s Nasreddine sees a silver lining in the media’s focus on these tests: “Cognitive screening is important for everyone—particularly if they are concerned about their cognitive performance — as we get older.” Kyle Ellingson Kyle Ellingson Martin J.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/how-much-water-should-you-drink-a-day/,"Do You Really Need 8 Glasses of Water a Day? Accumulating research shows that staying hydrated is important for older adults abu hasan ahmad / Getty Images By Kimberly Goad, AARP En español Published February 08, 2023 Ask any adult how many 8-ounce glasses of water they’re supposed to drink per day and they’ll probably deliver the one-word answer before you’ve had a chance to get the question out: eight.﻿ Not seven. Not nine. Eight. That’s the number that took hold in 1945 when the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council made its official recommendation for water intake. Though hidden within a more complex equation, the recommendation translated to roughly 64 ounces a day. And it referred to a person’s total daily water intake — not just pure water but also the amount taken in from foods and other beverages — though it was widely misinterpreted to mean that everybody, everywhere should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of plain water every day. Up for debate in the decades since: Do you really need that much? The answer isn’t so simple. “There are many factors that affect water needs and hydration status, such as body size, climate, activity and metabolic rate, etc., so water needs may differ from one individual to another and even for the same person under different circumstances,” says Paul Jacques, a senior scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center for Aging at Tufts University. Although the eight-glasses rule is an easy recommendation to remember, depending on how it’s interpreted, it might not meet the current recommendations for total water intake (meaning water contained in other beverages counts), which is 13 cups per day for men and nine cups a day for women, Jacques says. If you include water content from food, that number is even higher. The health-hydration connection Though experts may not agree on the precise amount of water we should drink to meet the total daily DRI (or dietary reference intake) for overall water consumption, this much is clear: Staying hydrated is a big deal. “You might think that since your body has so much water — more than 50 percent — it shouldn’t make a difference, even if you lose some,” says Stavros Kavouras, a professor of nutrition and director of the Hydration Science Lab at Arizona State University. “However, the data suggest that even a 1 to 2 percent water deficit is enough to lower exercise performance, impair cognitive function and worsen cardiovascular function.” That’s not all. A new study from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that adults who aren’t sufficiently hydrated may age faster, face a higher risk of chronic diseases — such as lung disease, diabetes, heart failure and stroke — and be more likely to die younger than those who stay well-hydrated. The results are based on 30 years’ worth of data collected from more than 11,000 adults in the U.S. who were 45 to 66 years old when the study began. The researchers looked at levels of sodium in the participants’ blood to determine hydration (higher concentrations are a sign that they most likely weren’t consuming enough fluids) and found that those with blood-sodium levels at the higher end of the normal range had aged faster than those at the lower end of the range. “While more research is needed, the main theory regarding the mechanism by which hydration status might affect health and aging is through elevated levels of antidiuretic hormone,” Jacques says. That’s the hormone “that helps regulate total body water by [controlling] water excretion in the kidneys and by stimulating thirst.” If you’re underhydrated, that hormone is elevated, he says. Exacerbating the problem: Research shows we tend to drink less as we age. One study published in 2019 in the journal SAGE Open Nursing suggests that up to 40 percent of older adults may be chronically underhydrated. The obvious culprits: Certain medications, such as diuretics, may negatively affect water balance, plus some older adults may intentionally reduce their water intake because of incontinence or other concerns about bladder control. What’s more, the sensation of thirst tends to decline with age. “When you’re younger, you get thirsty and you get something to drink, but older people in the same situation don’t feel thirst,” says Rosanne Leipzig, M.D., professor of medicine in the Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and author of Honest Aging. “It’s unclear why, but it has amazing repercussions.” Staying hydrated Generally speaking, eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, “even though it was not originally developed based on scientific data, is very close to what we need,” Kavouras says. Of course, lifestyle, climate and overall health play a role, he adds. “You will not have the same water needs if you train five hours a day in the middle of the summer, vers﻿us having a fairly sedentary lifestyle in the winter, but eight glasses a day is a good goal for most people.” How do you know if you’re not properly hydrated? Look for warning signs such as dry mouth, sluggishness and dizziness. Another indication: if you're going to the bathroom two to three times a day (and not every two to three hours) and producing urine that has a strong odor and looks more like apple juice than lemonade. To help remedy the situation, aim to eat more foods with high water content. For instance, cantaloupe, strawberries, watermelon, lettuce, celery, spinach and cooked squash are all at least 90 percent water; yogurt, apples, grapes, oranges, carrots, pears, pineapples and cooked broccoli are 80 to 89 percent water. “Hydration is a big deal — especially for older adults,” says Roopa Anmolsingh, M.D., with the Cleveland Clinic Center for Geriatric Medicine. “As a geriatrician, I would advise older people to discuss with their primary care providers what their individualized recommended daily water intake should be.” Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

We don't guarantee the accuracy of the tool and recommend consulting your doctor or health care provider regarding your particular situation. Your body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of your body fat that is based on your height and weight. Some doctors use BMI, along with other health indicators, to assess an person’s current health status and potential health risks. People with higher BMIs are more likely to develop chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and heart disease. To determine your own BMI, use this calculator. BMI calculator results are grouped into the broad categories: underweight, healthy weight, overweight and obesity. As you review your results, keep in mind that BMI has limitations, and should not be used to assess a child’s weight because the appropriate weight for children varies significantly by age. Learn more about how age and race might affect BMI results in our FAQ, below. If you have questions or concerns about your BMI results, talk to your doctor or health care provider. It’s important to know that many factors besides BMI — including family history, eating habits and activity levels — also affect your overall health. Learn more about losing weight naturally and healthily. Body Mass Index (BMI) FAQs Open All What is BMI? BMI, or body mass index, is a screening tool that takes into account a person’s height and weight. It slots people into four weight groups (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obesity) that may be linked to health problems. But BMI doesn’t directly measure a person’s health. The BMI should be used along with other measures, including your level of physical activity, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, to assess your risks for disease. What is a healthy BMI? The healthy weight category is defined as a BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9. A weight in this category is linked to fewer health problems than the underweight, overweight and obesity categories. What should my BMI be? The healthy weight category — defined as a BMI of between 18.5 to 24.9 — is considered ideal. But keep in mind that BMI is not a perfect measure. For example, it does not take into account how much fat you carry or where the fat is distributed, factors that can affect your metabolic health. How is BMI calculated? Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. How accurate is BMI? That depends. BMI can’t tell how much of your weight is from fat or muscle, so it misses information important to assessing your health risks. For instance, athletes can have a high BMI because of their muscle mass, even if they’re not overweight. Also, the definitions for the weight categories are based primarily on white populations, so it may be less accurate for people of other races and ethnicities. How can age or race affect BMI? BMI doesn’t differentiate between fat, bone and muscle; therefore, it may be less accurate for older people, who tend to lose muscle mass and bone density as they age. (That’s why people over 65 may benefit from a slightly higher BMI, between 25 and 27.) Research shows that the BMI definition of obesity overestimates risk in Black people and underestimates it in individuals of Asian descent, which may lead to inappropriate treatment and health disparities.

But accumulating research suggests these medications may help with a whole host of other health conditions. Ozempic, a type 2 diabetes medication, was recently approved to reduce the risk of worsening kidney problems in people who have chronic kidney disease and diabetes. Zepbound, initially approved for weight loss, gained federal approval in December for the treatment of sleep apnea in adults with obesity. And Wegovy, also approved for weight loss, can be prescribed to reduce the risk of a heart attack, stroke or other serious cardiovascular event in overweight adults with heart disease. And that’s just a quick snapshot of possible health perks: A study published Jan. 20 in the journal Nature Medicine linked these medications — known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s — to a lower risk of 42 health conditions, including dementia, clotting disorders and addiction. The recent flood of findings related to the benefits of these drugs is not shocking, says Ian Neeland, M.D., a cardiologist with University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute and director of the Center for Integrated and Novel Approaches in Vascular-Metabolic Disease. “Because all the conditions really stem from a central problem, which is excess dysfunctional adiposity,” or changes in fat tissue that can trigger insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, kidney disease and other complications. “It makes a lot of sense that if you address the central problem that's going on, you'll be able to ameliorate and improve all the different manifestations,” Neeland says. Here’s a look at some of the latest research on the benefits of GLP-1s, beyond weight loss. Effects on the heart, brain, kidneys and more Fewer cravings Some people taking a GLP-1 say many of their cravings — whether for alcohol, shopping or sugar — have subsided. “I have had patients tell me, for example, ‘I used to crave sweets all the time. Now I don’t care. I don’t need to eat a cookie every day being on these medications,’” says Chetna Bakshi, M.D., a bariatric surgeon at Northwell Health Syosset Hospital in New York. “That’s the biggest thing of how these medications work,” adds Shauna Levy, M.D., an obesity medicine physician at the Tulane University Medical Center in New Orleans and the medical director of Tulane’s Bariatric and Weight Loss Center. “They quiet the noise in your brain.” The most recent study published in Nature Medicine found that GLP-1 use was associated with a reduced risk of several substance-related disorders, including alcohol-use disorders, cannabis-use disorders, stimulant-use disorders and opioid-use disorders. Study coauthor Ziyad Al-Aly, M.D., director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and chief of the Research and Education Service at the VA St. Louis Health Care System, says additional research is underway to better understand how these medications could help treat addiction. Heart health benefits In a large clinical trial, researchers found that semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 20 percent in adults with heart disease and obesity. These results led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2024 to approve Wegovy, initially green-lit for weight loss, for a second indication: to reduce the risk of serious heart problems in adults with cardiovascular disease who are overweight or have obesity. “This patient population has a higher risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke. Providing a treatment option that is proven to lower this cardiovascular risk is a major advance for public health,” John Sharretts, M.D., director of the division of diabetes, lipid disorders and obesity in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release. Which GLP-1 medications are approved for what? Ozempic (semaglutide) Type 2 diabetes Preventing worsening kidney disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease Reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke or other heart events in adults with type 2 diabetes and heart disease Wegovy (semaglutide) Weight loss Reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in people who are overweight or have obesity and have cardiovascular disease Mounjaro (tirzepatide) Type 2 diabetes Zepbound (tirzepatide) Weight loss Sleep apnea in people who have obesity What’s more, a study published in 2024 in the journal Hypertension found that tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro (a diabetes drug) and Zepbound (approved for weight loss), significantly lowered the systolic blood pressure of nearly 500 adults who had obesity and took the medication for about eight months. The reduction in the top number in a blood pressure reading ranged from an average of 7.4 mm Hg to an average of 10.6 mm Hg, depending on the dose of medication. “While it is not known if the impact on blood pressure was due to the medication or the participants’ weight loss, the lower blood pressure measures seen with tirzepatide rivaled what is seen for many hypertension medications,” lead study author James A. de Lemos, M.D., a professor of medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said in a news release. Sleep apnea On Dec. 20, 2024, the FDA approved Zepbound for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity, making it the first medication to be approved for sleep apnea. In clinical trials, participants who took the medication saw significant improvements in their breathing while sleeping. They also lost more weight than participants assigned the placebo, and researchers say their weight loss was likely the reason for the other positive outcomes. About 30 million people in the United States have sleep apnea, according to the American Medical Association, and the condition is more likely to occur in older adults. Cutting kidney risks The FDA recently approved the diabetes drug Ozempic to reduce the risk of worsening kidney and cardiovascular issues in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The approval came after researchers leading a clinical trial of more than 3,500 participants found that a weekly dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, reduced the risk of serious kidney complications and contributed to cardiovascular benefits in participants. The study results were published in 2024 in The New England Journal of Medicine. Which GLP-1 medications are approved for what? Ozempic (semaglutide) Type 2 diabetes Preventing worsening kidney disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease Reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke or other heart events in adults with type 2 diabetes and heart disease Wegovy (semaglutide) Weight loss Reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in people who are overweight or have obesity and have cardiovascular disease Mounjaro (tirzepatide) Type 2 diabetes Zepbound (tirzepatide) Weight loss Sleep apnea in people who have obesity Protecting the brain The recently published Nature Medicine study found an association between GLP-1s and a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Al-Aly says researchers don’t fully understand why, but a reduction in inflammation and weight, known dementia risk factors, could have something to do with it. Al-Aly emphasizes that the risk reduction is modest, but in the absence of a proven effective treatment, “this is definitely welcome news and a big deal,” and one that researchers will continue to study. Results from a phase 2 study presented at the 2024 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference suggest that liraglutide, an older GLP-1 medication that’s the active ingredient in Victoza and Saxenda, may help protect the brain and slow cognitive decline. The study included 204 people with mild Alzheimer’s disease; half of the participants received liraglutide and half received a placebo. Researchers found that those who received liraglutide had a slower loss of brain volume, including in areas that control memory, learning, language and decision-making. The liraglutide group also had a slower decline in cognitive function over one year, compared with those who got the placebo. “The slower loss of brain volume suggests liraglutide protects the brain, much like statins protect the heart,” lead researcher Paul Edison, M.D., a professor of science at Imperial College London, said in a news release. “While further research is needed, liraglutide may work through various mechanisms, such as reducing inflammation in the brain, lowering insulin resistance and the toxic effects of Alzheimer’s biomarkers amyloid beta and tau, and improving how the brain’s nerve cells communicate.” Experts expect more approvals for additional health conditions While the benefits of GLP-1s continue to mount, it’s important not to ignore potential risks, doctors say. Like all medications, these drugs can cause side effects, some of which can be serious. (Read more on AARP: Side Effects of Weight Loss Drugs.) For older adults, a key concern is muscle loss, “and whether the loss of muscle is out of proportion to the amount of weight that's lost by people,” Neeland says. Older individuals are already at risk for age-related muscle loss, which can make them more prone to falls and fractures. “So it's important that the older adults who take these medications have strategies to maintain and preserve muscle, whether through resistance exercise training or protein supplementation or optimizing their nutrition,” he adds. Designing a GLP-1 that can preserve muscle mass is something scientists are actively studying, along with other ways to improve the medications, Neeland says. In the meantime, he and Al-Aly expect that researchers will uncover more health conditions that could be helped by the current suite of drugs. “It's very, very clear where this ship is heading. It's very, very clear that they have, by serendipity, a significant, broad health effect,” Al-Aly says. “And that should translate into expanded indications.” Does insurance cover weight loss drugs? That depends on what insurance you have and why the medication was prescribed. Medicare Part D will cover GLP-1 medications for diabetes treatment and some other indications, like cardiovascular disease in people who are overweight. However, the program currently will not cover medications strictly for weight loss. If you have private insurance, coverage will vary by plan. Without insurance coverage, the popular GLP-1s can cost upward of $1,300 per month. Medicare has selected Ozempic and Wegovy for its next round of price negotiations with drugmakers. Lower negotiated prices, which would take effect in 2027, are expected to lead to out-of-pocket savings for enrollees. Does insurance cover weight loss drugs?

Kernan, AARP Reviewed by Stanley Sack, M.D. Comments Published February 05, 2025 Sam Island Our stamina levels may be a little lower than they used to be. But it’s important not to assume that low energy is the norm for older adults. That can lead us down a slippery slope: When you feel tired, you may move less, get out of the house less, socialize less — all bad for your mental and physical well-being. And weariness or a lack of energy for a long period may be worth a conversation with your health care provider, since chronic fatigue can be a sign that something is wrong with your body. We talked to physicians and other health experts about the best ways for older adults to fight fatigue, and compiled a list of 25 science-based tips worth trying. 1. Hug for at least 10 seconds — consensually, please The warmth and fuzzies you feel hugging someone is actually oxytocin, often called the “love hormone,” coursing through your system. The calming effect boosts energy by reducing stress, which gives us a chance to recharge. “I don’t think we touch enough in our culture; some type of healthy, mutually consenting touch is very good for reducing stress, and therefore it’s going to help your energy,” says Shera Raisen, M.D., a physician of integrative medicine in New York City. If there’s no one nearby and willing, try hugging your pet. No pet? Studies show that self-soothing touch, like placing a hand on your heart, offers similar benefits. 2. Drink a glass of warm water Water is essential to every cell in your body. It regulates the body temperature, transports nutrients, assists in removing waste products and more. Naturally then, water has a powerful impact on how we feel. Starting the day with a tall glass is an easy way to avoid feeling sluggish later. Lukewarm water “can increase the metabolic rate, make you feel more relaxed and ready to start your day,” says Jaya Sanghavi, M.D., a physician at the Medical Nutrition Therapy Clinic in Maryland. “It can promote the body’s natural detoxification process, improve circulation throughout the body, stimulate digestion and can prevent constipation, promoting regular bowel movements.” 3. Try a cold shower or ice bath The shock of cold-water immersion can take your breath away, but it can also be invigorating. ﻿Cold-water exposure increases norepinephrine — an energizing brain chemical that increases alertness, arousal and attention, according to a 2022 research review. Cold water also causes blood vessels to constrict and blood to move to the core organs, where it becomes oxygen- and nutrient-rich. As the body warms up, that oxygen-rich blood flows back to the rest of the body, helping to reduce inflammation. However, if you have a heart condition, this one isn’t for you. ﻿4. Kick-start your metabolism with breakfast While a hearty breakfast won’t provide the same jolt as an icy plunge, this first and “most important meal of the day” kick-starts your metabolism. It becomes even more important for maintaining energy levels as we age, Sanghavi says. “Starting the day with a nutritious breakfast helps regulate appetite and reduce hunger later in the day, which can prevent overeating. It can help regulate blood sugar, provide overall energy and improve cognitive function,” she says. Try to get some of these important calories from protein. Refaat Hegazi, M.D., a nutrition specialist at Abbott Laboratories in Ohio, says protein needs can double with age, and research from Abbott and The Ohio State University revealed that more than one in three Americans over 50 aren’t getting enough. An easy rule of thumb for older adults is to aim for 25 to 30 grams of protein per meal, Hegazi says. “Try to include protein-rich foods like poultry, fish, dairy, soy foods, nuts and legumes at all eating occasions.” Basking in morning rays can boost your mood. Sam Island 5. Soak up the morning sun Basking in direct sunlight for 20 to 30 minutes first thing in the morning tells the brain to wake up and sets our internal clock. Morning rays can also boost mood by giving you a big dose of vitamin D, which helps the body make serotonin, also known as the “happy hormone.” For people living in places without a lot of sunlight, a light box is an excellent alternative, Raisen says. “Sit with it in front of you, pretty close, while you’re … reading or doing a meditation or just doodling or looking at your to-do list.” 6. Eat fiber-rich foods Foods rich in fiber are slow-burning fuel sources that sustain energy over long periods. New York-based gastroenterologist Divya Mallam, M.D., recommends 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber — about six to eight﻿ servings of fruits, vegetables and whole grains (brown rice, oatmeal, etc.) daily. And try to avoid “processed foods such as cereals, dessert and cakes, which are digested quickly and can cause blood sugar levels to spike and then quickly fall, leading to lower energy levels, or what is known as ‘food coma,’” she says. ﻿﻿7. Have a coffee, or two Without the dopamine-driven good mood and feeling of alertness provided by a morning cup of joe, many of us would struggle to get going. So, enjoy the burst of energy it provides. But caffeine affects people differently, so if you get a bit jittery after that third cup, for example, it could be a sign you’re over-caffeinated. The solution: Set a limit on the number of caffeinated beverages you drink in a day. Daily intake of more than 400 milligrams of caffeine — about four cups of coffee — is probably too much. Bonus tip: While some see energy drinks as an option for a quick boost of caffeine, with all the sugar and stimulants they contain, they’re probably not the best choice for a pick-me-up. Basking in morning rays can boost your mood. Sam Island ﻿8. Get moving — any way you can The many benefits of working out are widely known. It elevates mood and relieves stress. More oxygen flows to muscles and the brain. It’s good for cardiovascular health; good for bone and muscle health; and good for mental health. But one of the most remarkable ways exercising boosts our energy is by increasing the number of mitochondria within muscle cells. With more of these powerhouse organelles at work, the body can produce energy more efficiently. With all the different forms of exercise out there, from aqua-jogging to Zumba and everything in between, there is likely one for you. “Even if you are in a wheelchair or compromised due to health issues, I always tell my patients to make sure to move. You can ‘fidget’ with your upper body or your legs while sitting. Anything to get the body moving,” says Reed Berger, M.D., medical director of Obesity Programs at the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Medicine. “The great thing about exercise is that the benefit comes right away, almost when you start doing it, and it doesn’t have to be a lot, it doesn’t have to be running or anything too intense. Whatever exercise you’ll do is the best exercise,” says Harold Fain, M.D., an occupational health and family medicine physician at the Acclaim health group in Fort Worth, Texas. ﻿9. Go for a helper’s high Acts of kindness make us feel good, but why? Apparently, many (if not most) of us are hard-wired for empathy. Even a little bit of selflessness can activate the pleasure and reward centers in the brain, leading to feelings of satisfaction and well-being and giving you a “helper’s high” that can increase your overall energy and boost your mood. Even as our bodies age, we can keep our minds young by practicing kindness, says Kaushal Nanavati, M.D. assistant dean of wellness at State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. He recommends doing the simple things, such as “acknowledging somebody’s presence, appreciating something that somebody does for you, offering something without an expectation of getting something back — like a smile. It’s not about doing more, it’s about being present, and when we are, not only does our mindset shift, but what happens is we also start to shift the biochemistry within our body.” Being in nature awakens our body and mind, rewarding us with hits of dopamine and serotonin. Sam Island 10. Hug that tree Being in nature, whether it’s for a 10-mile hike or a stroll in the park, does something extraordinary to many of us. Almost immediately, our senses come alive with the sights, sounds and scents of the natural world. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol drop, and in as little as 20 minutes, calm sets in. Blood pressure settles down. Muscle tensions ease. Our body and awakened mind reward us with hits of dopamine and serotonin as an incentive to do it again soon. 11. Just say 'no' Saying “no” can be a form of kindness — to yourself. It’s an act of self﻿-care that will free you to focus on what really matters, rather than being overloaded with stressful, energy-draining obligations. By setting limits, you protect and conserve your mental energy. “Don’t be afraid to be true to yourself and say no when you feel overwhelmed in life. This goes for work, home, social obligations,” Berger says. 12. Take a whiff of peppermint oil Inhale it, apply it to the skin as oil or drink it as a tea. Chewing a minty stick of gum may work, too. Smelling this powerful herb may stimulate brain areas responsible for alertness and focus. Peppermint’s active ingredient, menthol, is a natural stimulant that can make us feel more awake and energized. A few small studies suggest that peppermint’s refreshing effect enhances physical and cognitive performance, including memory and problem-solving abilities. 13. Be a friend Feeling loved, supported and connected to others can improve mood, reduce stress and give you a sense of belonging, ultimately leading to increased energy levels and motivation. “The only way to have a friend is to be one,” Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote. Sage advice from an esteemed poet and philosopher, though exactly how one is supposed to go about forging social connections isn’t always obvious. Fain has a few suggestions: “If you lean toward the spiritual, get into a faith-based organization.” If not, what do you like to do? Do you like to knit? Do you like to listen to music? Join an organization. There are walking clubs, biking clubs, all kinds of organizations. “Or you can invite your neighbors over for pie or coffee. Just sit there and do nothing except talk for an hour.” 14. Get (a bit) fired up Research by psychologist Jennifer Lerner at the Harvard Kennedy School explores the energizing effect of a little anger. “When anger is moderate and directed at the right source, then you can capitalize on that energy-boosting exhilarating feeling when you think about the future and how to address an injustice,” she says. Using a technique called cognitive appraisal, people can harness their discontent to do something about a problem after they’ve identified its external source. By way of example, “let’s say you lose a pet, and that pet never had great health, because the pet was malnourished before it made its way into a shelter. Then, you found your injustice, and you turn that into your cause. You’re going to do something to redress the bad thing that happened.” Get in the habit of taking short naps — about 20 minutes — to feel refreshed. Sam Island 1﻿5. Power up with a power nap A midday nap, particularly a short “power nap” of around 20 minutes, boosts your energy by allowing your brain to briefly enter a lighter sleep stage. Any longer and you’ll enter deeper sleep, which may leave you waking up feeling groggy. “Shorter naps are better, because they don’t screw up your circadian rhythm,” Raisen says. Her father was a serial napper. For many years as a research chemist, he would close his office door after lunch, put his head on the desk and snooze. He’s 9﻿6 now and still living in his own home. She attributes much of his current mental acuity to napping. “As a culture, we underrate the value of naps for the pre-retirement and retirement age groups,” she says. ﻿ 16. Rest with yoga nidra or meditation Mindfulness practices are becoming more mainstream, and for good reason. They help us manage anxiety-provoking thoughts that sap energy and distract focus. Techniques such as non-sleep deep rest, meditation and yoga nidra use controlled breathing and focused attention to reduce stress and lower heart rate. The deeper mind-body connection that results gives people a feeling of relaxation and mental rejuvenation, Raisen says. Basically, these practices give your brain a mini-rest. When she has an exhausting day and can’t return home and go to sleep, Raisen lies down on a yoga mat and does a 10-, 15- or 30-minute guided yoga nidra. “I wake up so refreshed,” she says. “It’s so powerful.” Being in nature awakens our body and mind, rewarding us with hits of dopamine and serotonin. Sam Island Get in the habit of taking short naps — about 20 minutes — to feel refreshed. Sam Island 17. Embrace the good stress Pay attention to what excites you, because it can be a source of immense energy. The big sales presentation, a first date, your club’s tennis tournament — the intense feelings that can come with such events are examples of good stress, also called eustress, which triggers the body’s “fight or flight” response. Your heart races. Hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge. Blood pressure and glucose levels elevate. You are focused, alert and ready for action. Good stress inspires and motivates you, and even enhances immunity and cell repair, Nanavati says. “Eustress is like a controlled flame versus a raging fire. You can do a lot of good with the right amount of heat, but if it’s out of control, then things burn up.” 18. Enjoy the power of sexual intimacy Sex can release a trifecta of “feel-good” hormones in the brain: endorphins (natural pain relievers with mood-boosting effects), oxytocin (associated with bonding and relaxation) and dopamine (lights up the brain’s reward centers). Arousal can also trigger a small adrenaline rush, contributing to feelings of excitement and energy. In the body, muscles and tendons stretch, and joints flex. Respiration, heart rate and blood pressure increase, which in a healthy person can be energizing. ﻿ 19. Eat the rainbow Even though energy levels are felt in the brain, they often begin in the belly. Bacteria help break down the food we eat, so it’s good to have a lot of different kinds living in our gut. We encourage a diverse microbiome, as it’s called, by eating the rainbow, which means consuming a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. A wide range of nutrients and fiber helps healthy digestion by improving the body’s ability to absorb essential vitamins and minerals from food. When our diets fall short of nutritional excellence, or certain ailments cause nutrient deficiencies, fatigue and weakness can set in. The B vitamins help cells produce energy. Iron, magnesium and vitamin D also directly impact energy production. Your health﻿ care provider can help determine if you need a vitamin or mineral supplement. Put your phone and tablet away before bed and grab a book instead. Sam Island 20. Before bed, curl up with a book and ditch your devices Limiting screen time in the hours before bed allows your body to naturally produce melatonin, the sleep hormone. The blue light emitted from a cellphone, tablet or laptop screen suppresses this hormone, sabotaging your sleep. It’s recommended that you put your devices away at least an hour before bed. 2﻿1. Take a passeggiata The Mediterranean diet isn’t the only health-promoting thing to come out of Italy. In the after-dinner hours, couples, friends and whole families take to the piazzas and streets for a leisurely stroll together known as a passeggiata. Eustachio D’Angelo, 82, grew up in Tocco da Casauria, a small town in central Italy where, he says, “people have always enjoyed going out for a walk in the evening. I don’t think they do it because it’s a healthy thing. They like to see each other.” Still, the health benefits are numerous. This nightly ritual burns calories, improves blood sugar regulation, enhances fat metabolism, improves digestion, reduces bloating, improves circulation and lowers blood pressure. All that, plus, if you’re lucky, someone might treat you to gelato. 2﻿2. Avoid alcohol, especially before bed At dinner, maybe go easy on the vino if you really want to maximize your energy levels. ﻿ One big way avoiding alcohol boosts energy is by improving sleep quality. That super-relaxing nightcap (or two) disrupts sleep cycles, particularly the restorative REM sleep. Without adequate REM sleep, people feel less rested and more fatigued when they wake up. Alcohol also dehydrates the body, suppressing energy levels the next day. And older adults don’t process alcohol as well as they may have at younger ages. Better to find other ways to relax into the evening. For example… 23. Get a good night’s sleep Though it’s much easier said than done, sound, restorative sleep is hands down the most effective yet elusive tool for generating the energy we need to carry us through the day. In deep-sleep stages, the body repairs tissues and refills energy stores, essentially rebooting the body and brain so that you wake up feeling renewed. This process is particularly important for replenishing glycogen, the brain’s primary energy source, which is drawn down when we’re awake. Sun exposure early in the day, eating right and exercising, plus avoiding caffeine or alcohol in the hours before bedtime, will keep your body’s internal clock, the circadian rhythm and sleep schedule in sync. Bonus tip to avoid restless nights: make sure the room is dark, quiet and cool. 24. Shed a few pounds Avoiding refined carbohydrates, sugars and artificial sweeteners — plus getting exercise and good sleep — may provide the added benefit of losing a little weight. Any extra pounds you may be carrying around can be tiring and strain your heart. A lighter you will use less energy and probably go about the day experiencing fewer aches and pains. Overweight people are at higher risk for sleep apnea, a condition that makes it hard to breathe and compromises your sleep quality. Berger says older adults who lose weight in a healthy way “will notice increased energy due to less joint pain and overall improvements in exercise tolerance. They’re often able to do more with their friends and family as well, so it helps with their mental well-being, too.” 25. Talk to your doctor If lifestyle changes don’t fix your fatigue, maybe the problem isn’t something you’re doing, or not doing. Some medications can cause drowsiness or fatigue as a side effect. The common culprits are antidepressants, antihistamines, beta-blockers, muscle relaxants, opioids, benzodiazepines and some blood pressure medications, all of which can impact your central nervous system and make you tired. There’s also the possibility that an underlying medical condition might be causing low energy, such as anemia, thyroid issues and sleep disorders. Your doctor should also be able to provide further guidance on lifestyle changes like diet, exercise and stress management. Put your phone and tablet away before bed and grab a book instead.

Declining trends, however, shouldn’t be mistaken for lax precautions. Doctors and virus experts say it’s just about time for older adults to roll up their sleeves for another dose of the coronavirus vaccine. In October 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a recommendation that people ages 65 and older get a spring shot of the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine to boost their immune systems and restore protection that has waned since the fall, when the updated vaccines became available. Immunocompromised individuals — those who have cancer or take certain medications to treat an autoimmune disorder, for example — are also advised to get another COVID vaccine. “Those two groups are the ones that are now consistently making up the population that’s suffering from severe COVID-19, meaning emergency room visits or hospitalizations,” says Andrew Pekosz, a professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. In early January, the COVID hospitalization rate for adults younger than 50 was 1.0 per 100,000 people; for those 65-plus, it was 18.3 per 100,000. And during last year’s respiratory illness season, adults 65 and older accounted for 70 percent of all COVID-related hospitalizations. Why do older adults need a boost? A big reason has to do with age-related changes that make it more difficult for older adults to fight off an infection, explains Rachel M. Presti, M.D., a professor of medicine and medical director of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Unit at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. This is not unique to COVID-19. Older adults are more susceptible to severe illness from other bugs, such as influenza, which is why a high-dose version of the flu shot is recommended for people 65-plus. Additionally, the COVID vaccines “provide really pretty good protection in the short term, but by the time you get to month four, five and six, that protection begins to wane,” William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told AARP. And, unlike flu, which typically strikes during the fall and winter, COVID-19 is active year-round, which is why it has surged in the summer months. “So this six-month boost is meant to sort of kick that [immunity] back up to high levels of protection until the following fall,” Pekosz says, when people are typically vaccinated for flu and COVID-19. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. When should you get the COVID-19 vaccine? The recommendation from the CDC is for people age 65-plus to get the COVID-19 vaccine six months after their last dose. So, if you were vaccinated in September or October, you’re just about due for another. If you waited on the vaccine in the fall and got it more recently, however, you can still get another dose this spring. While the CDC advises a six-month stretch between the two shots, the agency says the minimum time is two months apart, “which allows flexibility to get the second dose prior to typical COVID-19 surges, travel, life events and health care visits.” Three different COVID-19 vaccines are available at pharmacies and health clinics, including an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech and a protein-based vaccine from Novavax. Less than a quarter of U.S. adults (about 23 percent) received the latest COVID-19 vaccine as of Feb. 22, federal data shows; an estimated 25 percent of adults 65 and older had received the shot as of November 2024, according to Medicare data. How effective is the COVID vaccine? The strains of coronavirus currently circulating have drifted from the variant the vaccines target. “But there have been a number of studies that show that the vaccine still does induce what we call cross-reactive antibodies and that it will recognize the currently circulating variants,” Pekosz says. “So it looks like it’s still effective,” Presti adds. Getting the vaccine this spring doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t catch COVID-19, but it does reduce the risk that you’ll experience severe illness if you get infected. “Thousands of people died of COVID-19 [in the past year], and the vast majority of them either haven’t been vaccinated or haven’t been vaccinated recently. So there certainly still is data that says that the vaccine is a safe and effective way to minimize severe disease,” Pekosz says. The COVID-19 vaccine can also help prevent the spread of the illness, Presti points out. “And that’s part of why vaccines are so effective,” she says. “It’s not just to protect you; it’s really to protect everyone around you as well because then, even if you get infected, you won’t transmit as much to other people, because you won’t be producing as much virus because your immune system will be able to clear it.” Heading into spring, it’s “still useful” to think of other ways to lower your chances of getting COVID-19, Presti adds. Wash your hands often, she says, and consider keeping a mask handy in case you’re out in public and people around you are coughing or sneezing. “It’s still a very legitimate way to protect yourself, in addition to getting the vaccine,” she says.

Medications help with some symptoms, and new options may slow early stages of this form of dementia By Hallie Levine Updated April 29, 2025 Reviewed by Jason Karlawish, M.D. Comments En español Published January 17, 2024 / Updated April 29, 2025 Ildar Imashev / Getty Images In the modern medical world, when someone is diagnosed with a disease, the usual first step is to be prescribed a well-proven medicine (or two) as a remedy. ﻿For dementia and one of its most common cause﻿s, Alzheimer’s disease, therapies that stop the disease have been elusive. But the outlook may be changing, at least for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in its early stages. Recent Food and Drug Administration approvals of two medications that slow the disease in some patients bring tempered excitement, says James Leverenz, M.D., director of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health at the Cleveland Clinic. ﻿“Perhaps we are on the road to being able to modify the disease, slow progression.”﻿ Dementia describes cognitive decline that interfere﻿s with a person’s ability to perform daily tasks, such as managing money. Our lack of a full picture of the causes of dementia has made it frustratingly difficult to develop medicines that stop the disease, let alone reverse its progress. Drugs that have been around for decades ﻿“are designed for the treatment of symptoms, and their effects are modest,” Leverenz says. Among the various types of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease has been the focus of most of the drug development work. More than 7 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s disease. The past two years have been encouraging, as two drugs have shown effectiveness in clinical testing in people at the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, specifically mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. These stages are not to be confused with early onset Alzheimer’s, which occurs before age 65. The two recently approved drugs appear to slow the progression of disease, but each comes with drawbacks. As research moves new drug options to the forefront, studies also point to lifestyle changes, some of them intensive, that can help prolong everyday function and improve behavioral and psychological symptoms of the disease. Below is a look at the medications available and what’s on the horizon.﻿ FDA-approved medications to slow Alzheimer’s Two drugs have full FDA approval to treat people with early stage Alzheimer’s. Both drugs target one of the abnormal proteins that build up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, and ﻿both approvals came with caution. The drugs are named Leqembi (lecanemab) and Kisunla (donamemab). A third drug, Aduhelm (aducanumab), got conditional FDA approval in 2021 but was discontinued by its maker, Biogen, in early 2024. ﻿ Leqembi and Kisunla are monoclonal antibodies that help remove amyloid plaques that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. These plaques appear to damage parts of the brain that are important for memory, thinking, learning and behavior. Leqembi received full FDA approval in July 2023. ​​The drug is given as an IV infusion once every two weeks at a medical office. In a phase 3 study comparing the drug with placebos, Leqembi’s makers, Eisai and Biogen, showed that Leqembi reduced the level of amyloid plaques while slowing the rate of cognitive decline by 27 percent over 18 months in patients in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. “It doesn’t stop the disease, and it doesn’t make people get better, but it slows down the rate where people get worse,” says Ronald Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Kisunla, made by Lilly and approved by the FDA in July 2024, slowed the loss of thinking and memory skills in a phase 3 study comparing the drug with placebos in patients with early stage Alzheimer’s disease. This drug “seems to get rid of the amyloid at the core of the plaques,” Leverenz says. “There’s a feeling that this amyloid is what drives the development and progression of the disease early on.” In an 18-month study giving Kisunla infusions every four weeks compared with placebos, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 38 percent, researchers reported in July in JAMA. Once amyloid levels dropped below a certain level, the drug was stopped. There are important limitations on the use of Leqembi and Kisunla. The FDA says the drug﻿s are only for those with mild cognitive impairment or mild-stage dementia. A person with MCI functions independently but with some inefficiency in daily activities. A person with mild dementia may have memory loss and confusion and trouble handling finances, problems that interfere with independence. The drug﻿s have a risk﻿, called ARIA, which stands for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. ARIA usually shows as bleeding of the brain that may be accompanied by swelling. In the large Leqembi study, about 13 percent of patients experienced brain swelling. In the Kisunla study, 25 percent of patients taking the drug experienced brain swelling. Most of these side effects disappeared within four months. Because people with two copies of the APOE e4 gene variant, which raises risk ﻿for Alzheimer’s disease, are more likely to experience ARIA, patients considered for Leqembi or Kisunla should be tested for APOE e4. Patients taking blood thinners are also at greater risk of brain bleeds while taking these drugs. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits A review of 31 studies of 31 studies of drugs that clear amyloid plaques, published in March 2023 in the journal Neurology, pointed out some brain shrinkage with these drugs. But what shrinks away are the amyloid plaques, says Nick Fox, M.D., professor of neurology and director of the Dementia Research Centre at University College London. “The brain volume shrinkage is related to amyloid removal; amyloid plaques occupy a significant volume in the cortex of the brain in Alzheimer’s disease,” he wrote in an email. “Studies show these plaques can be extensively removed by the immunotherapies thereby leading to a reduction in brain volume.” His paper supporting this conclusion is scheduled for September publication in Lancet Neurology. What might future treatments look like? ​Amyloid-clearing drugs may need to be paired with other types of drugs designed to remove a protein called tau from the brain. In Alzheimer’s disease, tangles of abnormal tau form inside nerve cells, causing problems in communication between nerve cells. Several tau-removing drugs are being tested in people with Alzheimer’s, including Biogen’s BIIB080, which reduced tau levels by more than 5﻿﻿﻿﻿0 percent in a very early clinical trial of 46 patients with early disease. Researchers, including those supported by AARP and others through the Dementia Discovery Fund, are developing and testing several other approaches to treat Alzheimer's and other dementias. Drugs to ease behaviors and other symptoms Several medications are available to treat certain Alzheimer’s symptoms, and some are used for other forms of dementia as well. These treatments do not slow progression of disease. They include: Cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs prevent the breakdown of a brain chemical called acetylcholine that’s important for memory and thinking, says Gary Small, M.D., at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey. Three examples are Aricept (donepezil), Exelon (rivastigmine) and Razadyne (galantamine), all approved for Alzheimer’s. Exelon is also approved to treat dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease.Namenda (memantine). This drug inhibits the activity of a brain chemical called glutamate, which sends messages between nerve cells. In Alzheimer’s disease, nerve cells make too much glutamate, which causes damage and cell death. Namenda is approved for people with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. The drug can be used on its own or with a cholinesterase inhibitor, Small says.Belsomra (suvorexant). The drug inhibits a brain chemical called orexin, which can keep a person awake. Belsomra is approved to treat insomnia in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Doctors may prescribe the drugs below to help treat symptoms that may appear in later stages of the disease: Antidepressants such as Zoloft (sertraline) to improve mood and irritability, although studies have questioned their effectiveness.Antipsychotic medications such as Risperdal (risperidone) or Haldol (haloperidol) for hallucinations, delusions, aggression or agitation. These drugs may not be appropriate for people with Lewy body dementia or Parkinson’s disease dementia, Petersen cautions, as they may worsen behavioral symptoms. The first anti-agitation drug to receive FDA approval, which occurred in May 2023. Rexulti (brexpiprazole) is prescribed for Alzheimer’s-related agitation, from pacing and restlessness to verbal and physical aggression. The drug comes with a black box warning, the FDA’s strongest, of an increased risk for death in older people with dementia. Although there are medications to treat other forms of dementia, they are usually geared to a specific condition, Petersen says. The treatment for vascular dementia, for example, is often aimed at improving blood vessel health, which means getting control of risk factors such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and being overweight.

I was enjoying a stroll around my neighborhood with my dog, Gunther, when I tripped over a crack in the sidewalk. As I fell, I thrust my right hand forward, and when I hit the ground, the pain and swelling in my wrist were immediate. After five decades, I had broken my first bone. ​ That incident gave me a crash course in bone health. First, I was sent for a bone density test, which revealed that my bones had thinned to the point of osteopenia (think of that as a precursor to osteoporosis, not unlike prediabetes is to diabetes). Then a blood test showed that my vitamin D levels were extremely low, which doctors told me was making it hard for my bones to access the calcium they so desperately needed. Suddenly, without a prior clue, I discovered I was on the express train to osteoporosis. Illustration by Fiona McDonnell; Getty Images; Stocksy Osteoporosis is often called a silent disease because people who have it may not know until a bone breaks. But it’s not entirely silent, says Andrea Singer, M.D.,﻿ director of bone densitometry at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and chief medical ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿officer of the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF)﻿. These are some of the most common — and surprising — signs that might mean you need a bone check: You’re getting shorter. Losing height is one of the most common signs that your spine might be shrinking. Measure yourself annually so you can spot this early.Unexplained back and neck pain. Back pain could have many causes, including a compression fracture or collapsed vertebra in your spine.Poor posture. If you feel uncomfortable when standing straight or notice a hunch in your upper back, it could be a sign of spinal bone loss or fracture.Shortness of breath. If your spine is starting to compress because of bone loss or fracture, your lung capacity may be reduced. Shortness of breath can be a symptom of several other serious issues too; always get it checked.Brittle fingernails. Nails that break easily might indicate you don’t have enough collagen in your diet. If your nails have vertical ridges, this could mean you’re not getting enough calcium from what you eat or drink, or your body may not be properly absorbing calcium.GI issues. Bone loss is connected to several gastrointestinal conditions, such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, both of which can inhibit nutrition absorption. In addition, some GI issues require treatment with steroids, which also lower bone density.Dental Issues. Tooth loss can be a sign of bone loss in the jaw area, and may additionally indicate bone loss and decreased bone density in other areas of the body. Pay close attention to this sign if you’re losing teeth too easily.Weaker grip strength. Having low grip strength is associated with a decrease in muscle strength, an increase in frailty and a heightened risk of falling and fracturing bones. Grip strength can be easily measured in a doctor’s office or at home with a simple tool called a hand dynamometer.Weight loss. Being a serial dieter, or losing significant weight or having rapid weight loss, increases your risk for bone loss.Broken bones. The most obvious signal of all: Fracturing a bone is a pretty clear sign that your bones are getting weaker. Know the risks Paying attention to these early warning signs of bone decline is important; so is knowing your risk of developing the bone-weakening disease. Certain factors can increase the likelihood of developing osteopenia and osteoporosis. Some of them are within your control. Others are not, but you need to be aware of them, too. 1. Age. As you age, your body tends to lose some bone density. But osteoporosis is not inevitable, and it can be slowed or halted with lifestyle changes — exercise and a bone-healthy diet, for example — and medications. 2. Gender. Women are four times as likely to develop osteoporosis as men are, and about half of women and one quarter of men over age 50 will break a bone because of osteopenia or osteoporosis. Illustration by Fiona McDonnell; Getty Images; Stocksy 3. Smoking. Yet another reason to try to kick the habit: Studies have shown a direct relationship between tobacco use and decreased bone density, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 4. Heavy drinking. Excessive alcohol consumption interferes with the balance of calcium, according to the NIH. Heavy drinking can also cause hormone deficiencies that can lead to weaker bones. 5. Menopause. This is when bone loss sets in with a vengeance. And women lose the most bone — up to 20 percent or more — during the first 10 years after menopause, notes Margaret Nachtigall, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist and clinical associate professor at NYU Langone Health and a founding member of the North American Menopause Society (NAMS). She says it may be appropriate for women at an increased risk for osteoporosis to consider hormone therapy (HT) during menopause. “Hormone treatment can help activate bone growth cells and therefore help restore bone or prevent bone loss,” she explains. But, although she said HT may be beneficial for some women, she cautioned that it isn’t for everyone; discuss your situation with your health care provider. 6. Poor dietary habits. Getting insufficient amounts of calcium, vitamin D and protein can increase the risk of osteoporosis. 7. Breast cancer. Fragile bones and fractures are more common in women who have been treated for breast cancer, partly because breast cancer treatment may trigger early menopause, says nurse practitioner Eva E. Meyers, of the National Breast Cancer Foundation Medical Advisory Council. 8. Physical inactivity. Just like exercise builds stronger muscles, it also builds stronger bones. 9. Family history. While research is ongoing, many studies have indicated that a family history of osteoporosis suggests that you’re also at higher risk for the disease, especially if a parent has had a hip fracture. A look at literature focusing on twins and families shows that between 25 and 85 percent of the variation in bone mass and other skeletal traits is inherited, but the why behind this continues to be studied. 10. Body type. The thinner you are, the thinner your bones, and the higher your risk for fracture is. While a healthy body mass index (BMI) is often better at lowering risk for certain health issues such as type 2 diabetes, it seems that a higher BMI protects both men and women against osteoporosis. According to Nachtigall, having more weight to carry around helps keep bones dense, and having a very low BMI is considered a risk for bone loss. It's also important to note that long-term use of certain medications may increase your risk for developing osteoporosis, the NIH says, including glucocorticoids (a class of steroid hormones); antiepileptic medicines; proton pump inhibitors (used to lower stomach acid); thiazolidinediones (which treat type 2 diabetes); and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), used treat depression and anxiety. Medications that affect hormone production to ﻿﻿﻿treat breast and prostate cancer are also on the list. Test your bones When I took my tumble, I had several risk factors for bone disease: I’m a woman; I was over 50; I wasn’t exercising; I wasn’t paying attention to my vitamin or mineral intake; I had gone through menopause and wasn’t taking any form of hormone therapy, so my estrogen levels were low, low, low. And despite all of those risk factors, until I experienced my fracture, no doctor had ever recommended a bone density test. Bone density, the concentration of minerals in your bones, is easy to check with a special X-ray called a DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan. BHOF recommends DEXA testing for anyone age 50 and older who has broken a bone or has risk factors for osteoporosis, and for women age 65 and older and men age 70 and older regardless of risk factors. If that’s you, talk with your doctor about getting a bone scan as part of your next overall checkup. There are also a few new testing options that, when used with DEXA, can capture a more complete picture of bone health. All can be done while getting your bone density test, and they are usually covered by Medicare and insurance. Trabecular Bone Score (TBS): The most promising is TBS, a new technology that works with the DEXA and looks at the microarchitecture of the bone, offering a better fracture risk assessment than measuring bone mineral density alone. According to E. Michael Lewiecki, M.D., director of the New Mexico Clinical Research & Osteoporosis Center, including TBS with FRAX (see below) could change treatment decisions. TBS is an add-on computerized analysis of the same DEXA scan, so there’s no additional time or X-ray exposure.The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®): This tool is a fracture risk calculator that is included in the software of most DEXA tests. According to Singer, it was developed to calculate 10-year probabilities of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture. You can do a self-test, as well. Access the test here.Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA): VFA is a sideways image of the spine with DEXA that may detect previously undiagnosed vertebral fractures (VFs), which are the most common type of osteoporotic fractures. Lewiecki says the VFA is a very useful tool because discovering a VF can change the assessment of fracture risk and influence treatment decisions.​​ The Calcium Connection For optimum bone health, the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that women over age 50 and men over 70 get 1,200 milligrams (mg) of calcium daily, while women age 50 and younger and men ﻿age 70 and younger should get 1,000 mg. But they strongly recommend that you aim to get your calcium from food first and supplement with pills only if necessary.​​ “Studies have shown that diets low in calcium are low in other essential nutrients, such as phosphorus, magnesium, iron, protein and zinc,” says Joan M. Lappe, a professor of medicine and professor of nursing at the Osteoporosis Research Center at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/immune-system-health/,"How Your Immune System Works After You Turn 50 Understanding your body's defenses against coronavirus, flu and the common cold Grace Cary/Getty Images By Clint Carter, AARP En español Published September 09, 2020 It's nearly impossible to find the good in a global pandemic, but COVID-19 did deliver one important lesson each of us should acknowledge: Our immune systems are in trouble. They're not “weaker” than those of generations ago. But they are more “dysregulated” — the medical term for a biological process or function that isn't working the way it should. Your immune system is less able to tell a deadly invader from a harmless one, for example, and more likely than in the past to attack your body's own healthy tissue by mistake. Plus, it's constantly turned on and working in counterproductive ways that were once much less common. Each of these is an indicator of disturbed immune function, and together they use up resources that should be going elsewhere. “We absolutely have more dysregulation in our population today,” says Mark Ansel, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of California, San Francisco. “And it's related to the changing way that we interact with our environment — everything from what we eat to what we do.” That's disturbing news for all of us as we head into the teeth of this winter's perfect storm: a potentially resurgent novel coronavirus that's still wreaking havoc across the nation, and the opening months of our annual flu season. But we're not helpless — not by a long shot — and here's what you need to know. How the immune system misfires There are many ways in which our bodies manifest immune problems, but three of them stand out, and the prevalence of each is increasing throughout our population. Chronic inflammation. Among those who were hospitalized with COVID-19, 34 percent had diabetes, 42 percent were obese and 57 percent had high blood pressure, according to a study published in JAMA in April. A common factor for all three conditions is chronic inflammation. It causes your immune system to pump out white blood cells and chemical messengers that keep your defenses actively engaged 24/7. ""It's almost like you're using all the immune system's resources just to keep this fire smoldering,” says Helen Messier, a California-based immunologist and director at Altum Medical. “When a viral infection happens during chronic inflammation, the immune system may either not be able to mount an appropriate immune response or, in the case of COVID-19, it doesn't have a good response initially but then tries to overcome it; the underlying inflammation can lead to an overpowering response, or ‘cytokine storm.’ "" Autoimmune diseases. Researchers have identified more than 80 distinct autoimmune disorders. While a few are widely known — such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), lupus and type 1 diabetes — many defy classification. But all share the common underlying issue of the body's immune system attacking itself. More than 24 million Americans have an autoimmune disease, and that number is climbing. When researchers in North Carolina examined 14,000 Americans between 1991 and 2012, they discovered that the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies, an early marker of autoimmunity, had increased by 45 percent. Another study — this one spanning three decades — found that autoimmune diseases of the joints, glands and digestive system are rising at a steady 3.7 to 7.1 percent each year. Smoking and being overweight are two risk factors within your control that are associated with greater risk of RA, one of the most common autoimmune disorders, which affects the lining of your joints. Food allergies. This is an immune system overreaction that can occur immediately after eating something as seemingly benign as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Food allergies now afflict more than 1 in 10 adults, according to a Northwestern University study of 40,000 people. Rates are particularly high for shellfish, milk and nut allergies, and the number of people who have them has been climbing steadily since the 1980s. “We're now more susceptible to responses against harmless stuff that shouldn't be a big problem for our immune system,” Ansel says. “But instead we generate these big and often destructive responses.” So what's causing the confusion in the immune system? To a large extent, it's our changing environment. ""Our bodies deal with thousands of chemicals that were not in the environment 50 years ago — and some not even 20 years ago,” says Aristo Vojdani, a clinical immunologist and adjunct associate professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Loma Linda University. Heavy metals and industrial pollutants are among the top offenders, but pesticides, preservatives and compounds in food can also alter immune function. All told, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) counts more than 300 environmental chemicals that reach measurable levels in our bodies. ""Exposure to different environmental insults can add up and alter how the immune system functions,” says David Shepherd, a professor of environmental immunology at the University of Montana. “In some cases, [the chemicals] are immune-activating,” meaning they cause inflammation, “and in others, they're immunosuppressive,” which makes you susceptible to attack. Add to that a general decrease in physical exercise, ever-increasing levels of stress and, yes, our increasing age. All these many factors have laid siege to our immune system like never before. We have the power The older we get, the more dysregulation our immune systems experience. Eight out of 10 COVID-19-related deaths reported in the United States have occurred among adults 65 and older, according to the CDC. And during the 2018–2019 season, influenza was linked to nearly 280,000 hospitalizations and more than 25,000 deaths in that same age group. But hidden in these figures is a bit of good news: The number of candles on your cake is just one factor in your immune system's biological age. “Only a small percentage — let's say 10 percent — of the decline in immunity is caused by aging itself,” Vojdani says. Genetics plays a role as well, but much less than you'd think. A few years ago, an international team of researchers collected blood from 210 sets of twins ranging in age from 8 to 82, and surveyed the samples for white blood cells and other markers of immune strength. The researchers concluded that 58 percent of the immune system is almost completely determined by nongenetic factors — factors that you can influence every day, and that can not only reduce your COVID-19 risk but also relieve you of the burden of so many other immune system–related diseases. ""There are many older people who have stronger immune systems than some younger people,” Vojdani says. “The answer is really lifestyle.” And those lifestyle choices are easy stuff, too. Start by eating unprocessed foods as much as possible — lean meats, fruits and vegetables, and whole grains that aren't prepackaged with preservatives, Vojdani says. It's equally important to avoid smoking and secondhand smoke, overconsumption of alcohol, fried foods and added sugars — and to ensure we're getting proper amounts of essential nutrients. We can also take time each day to exercise and find ways to reduce our stress levels. According to a JAMA study, people who suffer from stress-related disorders are 36 percent more likely to develop an autoimmune disorder. And, not surprisingly, this past year has been particularly stressful. A survey by the American Psychological Association suggests that our stress levels have jumped 10 percent. Andrew Brookes/Getty Images Get to know your immune system When bacteria and viruses enter your body, these natural defenders spring into action Macrophage This gargantuan white blood cell lies in wait within healthy tissue. Sometimes years pass without action, but when a pathogen emerges, macrophages release a blast of proteins called cytokines, which calls the immune system into battle. From there, the macrophage joins the cleanup crew by gobbling up dead and crippled pathogens. Natural Killer Cell Some infected cells can be rendered “invisible” to the immune system, which allows the pathogen to continue to spread unabated. That’s when natural killer cells provide an extra layer of defense. A natural killer cell has the ability to identify abnormal cellular appearance — as is often the case with cells infected by a virus. The killer cell studies its mark, and if the suspect cell appears to be infected, it releases proteins near the suspected pathogen. The pathogen then eats the protein — a fatal, final meal. Neutrophil At the first sign of trouble, neutrophils swarm like killer bees with multiple stingers. Neutrophils can capture their enemy, set traps, inject poison and amplify signals that pull in more immune-system warriors. Neutrophils only live for about a day, but as long as the battle continues, fresh cells keep showing up to fight. Unfortunately, in their frenzy, they can often mistake healthy cells for the enemy. When that happens, and the neutrophils attack healthy tissue, the result is inflammation, and inflammatory diseases, throughout the body. B Cell Although B cells don’t kill invaders directly, they help to slow down pathogens by covering them with sticky Y-shaped proteins, robbing them of their strength and making them easy targets for cells like macrophages, which eat them in clumps. The B cell is an adaptive immune cell, meaning it is highly effective against diseases it has battled before but struggles to recognize new pathogens. When a novel coronavirus arrives, it takes time to ramp up production of antibodies. T Cell The T cell is one of the special-ops white blood cells called upon to “recognize” a foreign invader and know exactly how to fight it off. With new enemies like COVID-19, however, the process can take weeks. Once the T cell learns the code — essentially mapping the molecular structure on a pathogen’s surface — it quickly trains an army of T cells to begin opening infected cells and pumping them full of toxins. Doctors call this process immunity, although with COVID-19, we still aren’t certain how long it lasts. Clint Carter reports on wellness for Men's Health and other national magazines.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/new-covid-vaccines-cdc-guidelines.html,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by 7 Things to Know About the New COVID Vaccines FDA approves updated coronavirus shots for 2024-2025 By Rachel Nania, Updated October 24, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published August 22, 2024 / Updated October 24, 2024 AARP (Getty Images (2)) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed off on updated versions of coronavirus vaccine that target a more recent variant of the virus that was behind this summer’s surge in COVID-19 cases. The new shots — one from Moderna﻿, another from Pfizer/BioNTech and a third from Novavax — are available at pharmacies and doctors’ offices across the country﻿, and infectious disease experts hope the reformulated vaccines will help to keep cases from swelling this fall and winter. Here are seven things you need to know about the updated COVID-19 vaccines. 1. The mRNA vaccines target a FLiRT variant During the summer, the FDA recommended that vaccine manufacturers target the KP.2 coronavirus strain in the 2024-2025 COVID vaccines. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. At the time, KP.2, a member of the FLiRT variant family and a descendant of omicron, was behind a large share of increasing infections in the U.S. Though this particular strain is no longer among the top circulating variants, its close relatives are, and health experts expect that the updated vaccines will provide strong protection against them as well. The FLiRT variants all came from the same parent strain, explains Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. “And there are very, very minimal mutational changes between all of them.” 2. Another shot can restore waning immunity It’s not just about making sure we have a vaccine that targets the most recent versions of the virus, Guest says. It’s also about restoring faded immunity. Paying for a COVID vaccine ﻿ Most people with Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance can get an updated COVID vaccine at no cost through their health plans, the CDC says. Health officials urge individuals without insurance to contact their state or local health department for information about free vaccines, now that the national Bridge Access Program has ended. You can find a directory of state and local health departments on the CDC’s website. “We know that immunity from this vaccine diminishes over time,” she says, so the vaccine you received last year isn’t providing you with optimal protection now. Though the summer surge has receded, around 1,000 Americans are still dying from the disease each week, the latest data from the week of Sept. 21 shows. “I think the population would like to put the pandemic in the rearview mirror and not really think about it anymore. But the virus is still very much with us and still continues to cause problems,” says Mark Rupp, M.D., a professor and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The vast majority of COVID hospitalizations that occurred from October 2023 to March 2024 were among individuals who were not vaccinated or not up to date on their vaccinations, according to data presented at a meeting of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory committee.

According to recent findings from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, 45 percent of adults age 50-plus plan to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall. A few other findings: 59 percent of adults age 75 and older plan to get the vaccine. 51 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 plan to get the vaccine. 37 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 plan to get the vaccine. Beyond restoring protection from a short-term illness, the CDC says, the vaccines can reduce the likelihood “of suffering the effects of long COVID,” which has impacted an estimated 17 million U.S. adults, according to a report from the health policy nonprofit KFF. Long COVID — marked by symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, headaches and joint and muscle pain — can creep in after a coronavirus infection clears and last for months, even years. Symptoms can be so severe for some people that they can result in a disability, the CDC says. “That risk of long COVID is there and it’s real, and it can be minimized by getting vaccinated,” Rupp says. 4. Virtually everyone should get new vaccine The CDC recommended that everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID vaccination once it’s available. “It’s really important that everyone get this vaccine; it is even more important than anyone 60 and older get it,” Guest says. “And we just can't stress enough that the majority of the severe complications from COVID-19, and unfortunately the fact that we still have deaths … they’re more likely to be among people who are older than 60. And so getting this is really important to protect them from consequences like that.” If you’re 65 and older, plan to go back in the spring for a second shot. On Oct. 23, the CDC issued a recommendation for people 65-plus and those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised to receive a second dose of 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine six months after their first dose. Who will get the COVID vaccine? According to recent findings from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, 45 percent of adults age 50-plus plan to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall. A few other findings: 59 percent of adults age 75 and older plan to get the vaccine. 51 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 plan to get the vaccine. 37 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 plan to get the vaccine. “For the past several years at least, we've had two increases of COVID a year. There's a summer increase, and then it abates, and then we have another, and usually larger, winter increase,” says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. “And we know that the COVID vaccines provide good protection in the short-term, but by the time you get to month four, five and six, that protection begins to wane.” The idea is a second shot in the spring can protect older adults through the summer surge, until an updated vaccine is released in the fall, he explains. 5. The (mostly mild) side effects remain the same Not everyone experiences side effects after vaccination, but some people do, and the FDA says for those individuals, there are no surprises with the updated vaccines. Common side effects can include: Pain, swelling and redness at the injection site FatigueHeadacheMuscle painChillsNauseaFever Side effects tend to be mild and generally go away in a few days, the CDC says. “These updated vaccines meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality,” Peter Marks, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. 6. You can get your COVID and flu shots at the same time If you’re looking to save time and an extra trip to the clinic, you can get your COVID vaccine and flu shot — even the RSV vaccine, too — at the same time. The optimal time to get the flu shot is September and October, the CDC says. Where you live may influence your decision on whether to pair up flu and COVID vaccines. “The northern half of the country tends to see the flu season start close to a month earlier than the southern part of the country,” Guest says. “And so in the northern states, I would not even consider waiting. I would go ahead and get both if they were available. If they are not available for some reason, and only COVID is, I would get the COVID [vaccine now] and then go back [for your flu shot].” 7. An updated vaccine from Novavax is authorized Novavax’s vaccine — which uses a more traditional (protein-based) technology from the mRNA vaccines — was authorized by the FDA on Aug. 30 for individuals 12 and older. Instead of targeting the KP.2 variant, Novavax’s 2024-2025 vaccine targets JN.1, which the company describes as “the ‘parent strain’ of currently circulating variants.” It’s expected to provide strong protection from the variants that are spreading, Rupp says.

The main findings are that the updated vaccines target recent variants of the virus, can restore waning immunity, and reduce the risk of long COVID. Notably, the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated, with a second dose recommended for those 65 and older six months after the first dose, highlighting the importance of vaccination for older adults.",63
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/flu-covid-rsv-norovirus-quademic/,"How Older Adults Can Survive the ‘Quad-emic’ Lower your risk of getting sick from the winter surge in COVID, flu, norovirus and RSV By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published January 24, 2025 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (3)) A trio of respiratory illnesses — flu, COVID-19 and RSV — is sweeping the U.S. and leaving a trail of coughing and aching victims in its wake. But this winter, there’s a fourth bug that’s also bringing misery to the masses: Outbreaks of norovirus, a gastrointestinal affliction, are surging too, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. The convergence of all four has spawned the nickname the “quad-emic.” An uptick in any of these viral illnesses is not unexpected this time of year, health experts say. Cases of flu, COVID and RSV (short for respiratory syncytial virus) tend to start climbing in the fall and peak in the winter months. Currently, emergency room visits for flu and RSV are high and continue to increase, the latest CDC data shows. Norovirus cases also tend to creep up in the cold-weather months, even though you can catch the nasty stomach bug any time of year, says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. However this year, “we appear to be having, across the country, a more substantial winter increase of norovirus,” Schaffner says. According to the CDC, reported norovirus outbreaks for the 2024-2025 season are the highest they have been in 12 years. Edward Liu, M.D., chief of infectious diseases at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, says we don’t have a clear understanding as to why norovirus cases are especially high this year. It could be that more people are clustering together this winter, he says. (Norovirus is highly contagious and can spread quickly and easily from person to person.) A new strain of the virus could also be to blame, since “newer strains generally circulate more widely until things tamp down,” Schaffner adds. Video: CDC Director Explains Why Older Adults Should Protect Against RSV Quad-emic is a threat to older adults Age-related changes that impact the immune system — plus underlying chronic health issues that become more common with age — put older adults at higher risk for serious complications from respiratory illnesses such as COVID, flu and RSV, the CDC says. Warning signs of severe illness with these infections can include trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, and dizziness or confusion, among others. Similarly, older adults are among those at higher risk for complications from a norovirus infection. The virus causes around 900 deaths in the U.S. each year, and most are among adults aged 65 and older, the CDC says. The concern with norovirus, which brings on vomiting and diarrhea, is dehydration, Schaffner says. “Deaths associated with norovirus usually are a consequence of dehydration and also loss of control of chronic underlying illnesses,” he says. Older adults are more vulnerable to dehydration, research shows, since the amount of water in our bodies decreases with age. Decreased kidney function can also affect fluid levels in older bodies, the Cleveland Clinic says. Signs of dehydration can include decreased urination, dry mouth and throat, fatigue, and feeling dizzy when standing up, according to the CDC. What’s more, weakness caused by days of nausea and vomiting with a norovirus infection can put older adults at higher risk for falls, Liu says. And falls are the leading cause of injury among adults 65-plus. Video: CDC Director Explains Why Older Adults Should Protect Against RSV Staying healthy during a quad-emic Just because there’s a lot of illness swirling about this winter, doesn’t mean you’re destined to spend the season sick. There are vaccines that can protect against severe illness for COVID, flu and RSV, and health officials recommend that older adults get them. (No, it's not too late to get the shots if you skipped them this fall, doctors say.) Masks can also help thwart an infection from influenza, COVID and RSV, Schaffner says, since they are spread mainly by way of respiratory droplets that are made when people exhale, cough, talk or sneeze. When it comes to norovirus, hand washing is key, Liu says, since the virus spreads through contaminated food, water or surfaces, where it can survive for days, even weeks. And it’s best to skip the hand sanitizer and stick to soap and water, since sanitizers are not very effective against norovirus, Schaffner says. Folks who are more susceptible to severe illness from any of these bugs may also want to consider social distancing during the current outbreak. “Stream the movie rather than going to the movie,” Schaffner says. And watch yourself around the grandkids if they have been sick, since “it's very easy to pass [these illnesses] from the grandkids to grandparents,” Liu says. The good news: Just like spikes in virus activity are expected in the winter, lulls are expected in the spring. “Generally, we see less of it once it starts to warm up,” Liu says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eye-health-conditions-symptoms-treatments/,"Common Eye Conditions in Older Adults: Causes, Treatments and Symptoms These common symptoms may be signs of an eye disease By Aaron Kassraie, AARP Comments Published December 18, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (6)) Choose Your Next Age-Related Eye Condition Story: What to know about cataracts What causes blurry vision in one eye Sudden blurry vision in both eyes What to do about peripheral vision loss Flashes and flickering in the eyes Could you have light sensitivity? What is diabetic retinopathy When are dry irritated eyes a sign of thyroid disease? Eye floaters, causes, symptoms and treatment As we age, we can develop a wide range of issues that affect our eyes. In fact, adults aged 60 and older account for the majority of blindness cases worldwide. The top culprits? Age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. The good news is that you can stay ahead of these issues by being aware of the warning signs of age-related eye problems and scheduling regular eye exams, as recommended by the American Optometric Association. In this guide, we’ll break down common eye health problems, their symptoms and how to treat them. You’ll also find tips to keep your vision sharp and protect your eyesight as you age. Recognizing symptoms of eye disease As we age, our vision naturally begins to weaken. According to the Cleveland Clinic, changes can start as early as your 40s, with decreased tear production being one of the first signs. Over time, proteins in the eye's lens may break down, leading to cataracts, while the vitreous — a gel-like substance in the center of the eye — can shrink, resulting in floaters or even a more serious condition called retinal detachment. Eye conditions can also pose safety risks, such as an increased likelihood of falls or accidents. Additionally, eye exams can sometimes reveal other underlying health conditions. These include issues like aneurysms, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, multiple sclerosis, vitamin A deficiency, strokes and tumors. Causes of eye conditions A lot of factors can lead to vision problems, and some are more obvious than others. For example, a lack of nutritious foods in your diet, smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and skipping sunglasses on sunny days can all take a toll on your vision. But it’s not just about lifestyle. Genetics play a big role too — your DNA shapes how your eyes develop and work, and changes in your genes can lead to conditions like color blindness. Sometimes, differences in how your eyes formed as a fetus or during childhood can also set the stage for problems later in life. Environmental factors matter as well. Too much exposure to UV light, dust, or even the wrong humidity and temperature can contribute to eye issues. Then there are infections. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites can either attack your eyes directly or spread from other parts of your body. Other chronic conditions, like Type 2 diabetes or thyroid disease, can also make your eyes more vulnerable. Past injuries might leave lasting effects, increasing your risk for future problems. And sometimes, the cause is simply unknown — what scientists call “idiopathic.” No matter the reason, understanding these factors can help you stay ahead of potential issues and protect your vision. Symptoms of age-related eye diseases Many people with age-related eye diseases don’t notice symptoms in the early stages. But when symptoms do show up, they can look different depending on the condition. Common ones include: Cloudy or blurry visionDiscomfort or burningToo many or too few tearsSeeing spots or flashes of lightSensitivity to lightDifficulty distinguishing colorsTunnel vision Choose Your Next Age-Related Eye Condition Story: What to know about cataracts What causes blurry vision in one eye Sudden blurry vision in both eyes What to do about peripheral vision loss Flashes and flickering in the eyes Could you have light sensitivity? What is diabetic retinopathy When are dry irritated eyes a sign of thyroid disease? Eye floaters, causes, symptoms and treatment These symptoms can make everyday tasks harder. You might struggle to read small print, get frequent headaches, misjudge distances or have trouble focusing on things up close or far away. Night vision can also worsen, leaving you squinting in the dark, and your eyes might feel more tired than usual. Eye conditions and symptoms to look out for Cataracts Cataracts are one of the most common age-related eye issues. Over time, proteins in your eye’s lens start breaking down, making your vision blurry or cloudy. This usually begins after age 40 and becomes more noticeable as you hit 60. While aging is the main cause, factors such as too much sun exposure, smoking or chronic illnesses can speed things up. You might notice trouble seeing at night, sensitivity to glare, or colors looking duller than usual. The good news? Early cataracts can often be managed with better lighting or glasses, but surgery is the ultimate fix. Cataract surgery is typically a quick outpatient procedure that replaces the cloudy lens with a clear, artificial one. To help delay cataracts, wear sunglasses, eat a healthy diet and skip the smokes. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for cataracts. Blurred vision in one eye If one eye suddenly gets blurry, it can be a sign of something serious. Causes range from strokes or brain tumors to retinal detachment and closed-angle glaucoma. Even dehydration can cause blurry vision by drying out your eyes or lowering blood pressure. Keep an eye out for symptoms like flashing lights, floaters, or rapid vision changes — they’re all red flags. If anything seems off, get to an eye doctor as soon as possible. Treatment depends on the cause, whether that’s an urgent fix for a detached retina or long-term care for conditions like cataracts. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for blurred vision in one eye. Blurred vision in both eyes Blurriness in both eyes might not be as urgent as a sudden change in one eye, but it still deserves attention. It could point to common issues like dry eyes, cataracts, or even more serious conditions like a stroke or diabetes complications. If your vision suddenly takes a turn for the worse, especially if combined with other symptoms like dizziness or confusion, don’t wait — see a doctor. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for blurred vision in both eyes. Light sensitivity (photophobia) If bright lights make you squint, wince, or even feel pain, you might have photophobia. It’s often linked to migraines, dry eyes or certain medications. You might also notice eye pain or headaches triggered by bright light. Addressing the root cause — like treating dry eyes or managing migraines—is key. Lifestyle tweaks can help too, like wearing UV-blocking sunglasses or using tinted lenses to reduce blue light exposure. Devices which emits soothing green light, might also offer relief. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for light sensitivity in your eyes. Diabetic retinopathy For people with diabetes, diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision loss. In the early stages, high blood sugar can damage blood vessels in the retina, causing blurry vision or swelling (nonproliferative retinopathy). Advanced stages (proliferative retinopathy) can lead to bleeding, scarring, or retinal detachment. The best way to protect your vision is to manage your diabetes carefully. Keep blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol in check, and get regular eye exams. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for diabetic retinopathy. Graves’ disease Graves’ disease also known as Thyroid Eye Disease (TED), is an autoimmune disorder that can also affect your eyes. It’s linked to an overactive thyroid and can cause dry, swollen, or irritated eyes, as well as blurry or double vision. Some people might even notice bulging eyes or increased sensitivity to light. Treatment focuses on controlling thyroid function and addressing eye symptoms with medications or, in severe cases, surgery. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for Graves’ disease. Flashing lights behind eyes Seeing flashes of light or flickers in your vision can feel alarming — and for good reason. It could be caused by something as harmless as retinal migraines or as serious as a retinal tear or detachment. These often happen as the gel in your eye changes with age and tugs on the retina. If you notice these symptoms, especially alongside floaters or rapid vision changes, see an eye doctor right away. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for flashing lights behind your eyes. Floaters Floaters can appear as rings, squiggles, strands, or even cobweb-like shapes. They’re easiest to see when you’re looking at a bright background, like a clear sky or a white wall. Most of the time, floaters are just the result of age-related changes in the vitreous, the gel-like substance inside your eye. But they can also show up after an eye injury, an infection, or as a symptom of conditions like uveitis (inflammation inside the eye) or diabetes. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for eye floaters. Tunnel vision Peripheral vision loss, also called tunnel vision, can happen gradually or suddenly, and it’s linked to several eye conditions and overall health issues. This condition makes it harder to see from the outer field of vision, which can make simple tasks like walking through crowded areas or driving at night feel tricky. While some narrowing of peripheral vision is normal as we age, a significant or sudden loss isn’t. If that happens, it’s important to see a doctor. Several health issues can lead to peripheral vision loss, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, stroke and retinal detachment. The changes can be subtle at first, and peripheral vision loss often sneaks up on you. Many people don’t notice it until it begins to interfere with daily activities. Learn more about the cause, symptoms and treatments for tunnel vision.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/pneumonia-symptoms-treatments/,"What Is Pneumonia? 5 Warning Signs to Watch For Whether caused by viruses, fungi or bacteria, this lung infection can turn serious — especially in older adults By Michelle Crouch, Updated February 18, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 02, 2021 / Updated February 18, 2025 Getty Images It’s pretty common to develop a cough or an upper respiratory infection in the winter. Most of the time you get over it quickly. But sometimes a winter illness can develop into pneumonia, a lung infection that is particularly dangerous for older adults. In a typical year, about 1.4 million Americans go to the emergency room with pneumonia and more than 41,000 people die of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pneumonia can cause severe illness in people of any age, but children under age 5 and older adults are the most vulnerable. A 2022 National Health Statistics report found about 5 percent of patients aged 18 to 44 died while hospitalized for pneumonia; that share jumped to 11 percent among patients 65 and older. People who smoke, have weak immune systems or suffer from chronic conditions such as lung disease or heart disease are at higher risk for complications from the illness. Pneumonia causes and diagnosis Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses, including the ones that cause the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19. The vast majority of people with pneumonia have bacterial infections, but recent data suggests that viruses cause more cases than doctors previously realized. Bacterial pneumonias tend to be more severe than those caused by viruses. It’s not unusual to develop bacterial pneumonia while your body is fighting a viral infection, says Todd Rice, M.D., professor of medicine and director of the medical intensive care unit at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Pneumonia is diagnosed with a chest X-ray or CT scan. Your doctor may also send your blood and a mucus sample to a lab for a culture to try to determine what type of bacteria or virus is the culprit. 5 pneumonia warning signs and symptoms Pneumonia symptoms can be mild or severe. They tend to be similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer and may get worse over time. Here are some common symptoms. Productive cough. You will be “coughing up lots of nasty stuff,” says Charles Bregier, M.D., an emergency medicine physician and medical director at Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. The sputum often has a yellow, green or gray look. Fever. Fever and chills are signs that your body is fighting the infection. But the absence of a fever doesn’t necessarily rule out pneumonia, especially in those age 65 and older. (See sidebar.) Shortness of breath. You may have trouble catching your breath when walking or talking, or feel like you’re breathing faster than normal. Chest pain. You may experience sharp or stabbing chest pain that hurts more when you take a deep breath or cough.Dizziness or delirium. Some older adults with pneumonia may experience a change in cognition or awareness, says Sarina Sahetya, M.D., a pulmonologist and intensivist at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “If someone comes into the hospital and says their loved one is confused,” she says, “that’s a red flag for us to start looking for infection.” When to call a doctor What to know about pneumonia and body temperature A fever is often associated with pneumonia because the body is fighting an infection, but that’s not always the case in older adults, says Sahetya. Sometimes older adults with pneumonia actually develop a low body temperature — below 97 degrees Fahrenheit, she notes. “It has to do with how your immune system is responding to infection,” she says. “In people who are older, who tend to have weaker immune systems or who are immunosuppressed, instead of getting the immune system revved up, the infection actually can cause low temperatures.” It’s important to reach out to your doctor right away if you suspect pneumonia, especially if the patient is in a higher-risk group. Because dangerous complications can occur, starting treatment early can be critical. If at any time you are experiencing shortness of breath or persistent chest pain, you should seek immediate care by going to the emergency room, Rice says. How to prevent pneumonia How can you protect yourself and your loved ones from pneumonia? Start by taking the same steps you use to protect yourself against other illnesses: wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your nose and mouth, and stay away from those who are coughing and sneezing. To keep your immune system strong, make sure you get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. Getting the influenza, RSV and COVID-19 vaccines will help protect you from pneumonia caused by those viruses. There’s also a vaccine that helps protect against pneumococcal disease, which can lead to pneumococcal pneumonia, the most common type of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. The pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults 50 and older and others with certain health conditions that increase their risk for serious illness.

Spotting its signs could dramatically improve a person’s chances of recovery By Ingrid Wickelgren Reviewed by Selma C. Kunitz, Ph.D. Comments En español Published January 30, 2024 FG Trade / Getty Images Video: How to Spot Symptoms of a Stroke ﻿Yael Shvetz, 53, was sick in bed in her Hillsborough, New Jersey, home in April 2022. The mother of four had a piercing headache, and her migraine medicine wasn’t helping. Worse, she’d been throwing up for hours. She’d had migraines before, but never with this kind of vomiting. She thought she’d eaten some bad chocolate pudding﻿. When Shvetz tried to get out of bed, she fell to the floor with a thud. Her children quickly called 911. By the time the paramedics arrived, Shvetz was barely functional. “My brain was foggy,” she says. “I was mumbling and going in and out of remembering and knowing what I was doing and saying.” No one knew it then, but Shvetz had had a stroke. A blood vessel in her brain had burst. Deprived of oxygen, brain cells﻿﻿ were dying rapidly. “You lose roughly 2 million brain cells every minute a stroke is happening,” says William “BJ” Hicks, M.D., a vascular neurologist and codirector of Riverside Methodist Hospital Comprehensive Stroke Center in Columbus, Ohio. Given this fast rate of damage, the sooner a person gets treatment, the more likely they are to avoid severe brain damage or death. “Stroke is the number one cause of disability in adults in the United States … especially if the patient is not getting to the hospital quickly,” Hicks says. Detecting the symptoms The challenge is that some symptoms of a stroke can easily be misinterpreted. Headaches and vomiting, for example, are shared with other, often less deadly conditions. In Shvetz’s situation, “the paramedics thought I was dehydrated, so they took their good ol’ time,” she says. Numbness, dizziness or disorientation can also come on suddenly, then disappear. This may be a sign of a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, a short-lived stroke that still needs immediate attention, as it can be a warning sign that a more serious stroke is on the horizon. A brain bleed like Shvetz’s is called a hemorrhagic stroke. “People will tell you, ‘It’s the worst headache of my life,’ and they will often get nauseated and throw up,” says David Miller, M.D., an interventional radiologist and codirector of the stroke center at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Hicks likens it to a pipe bursting inside the skull. Pressure builds, causing pain. The pain Shvetz experienced is not typical of the more common ischemic stroke, in which a clot stops blood from reaching brain tissue, Miller says. Ischemic strokes make up 87 percent of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Video: How to Spot Symptoms of a Stroke Still, Shvetz had some of the telltale signs of both types of stroke. Doctors use the acronym B.E.F.A.S.T. for these common signs. Encounter one or more, and you should take quick action: ​B – balance loss​ E – eyesight change F – face drooping​ A – arm weakness S – speech difficulty​ T – time to call 911 AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits ​Here’s how doctors describe what you might see:​ B – balance loss: A person may suddenly fall like Shvetz did, unable to get up, Miller says. This was what alarmed Shvetz’s 17-year-old daughter, who found her mom on the floor and had to get her older brother to lift their mom back into bed. If it’s a stroke, the loss of coordination is likely to be on one side of the body. For instance, a hand or arm on the same side may be clumsy. If a person is holding something in that hand, they may drop it and be unable to pick it up, Miller says. Shvetz’s stroke was in her right brain, which controls the left side of her body. But that wasn’t apparent from her fall. E – eyesight change: A person may suddenly lose peripheral vision, or their eyes may drift over to one side rather than aiming straight ahead. F – face drooping: One side of the person’s face may sag noticeably. Ask the person to smile. If one side of the face smiles but the other side does not, you should suspect a stroke. A – arm weakness: To check for weakness, ask the person to hold up their arms in front of them, to the side or above the head. If they can’t lift one arm or an arm starts to drift down, they may be having a stroke. Same goes for the legs. The person may have trouble lifting one leg while sitting in a chair or lying on the ground. S – speech difficulty: A person’s speech may be slurred or slow. “If you have them try to speak or repeat or name things and they can’t get the words out quickly, as quickly as they normally can, those symptoms are classic for a stroke,” Hicks says. If the stroke hits the language areas of the brain, the person’s speech may stop making sense or they will not be able to talk at all, Miller says. They should be able to understand simple commands, such as “show two fingers on your right hand,” or “smile,” Miller says. “If they can’t do that, that’s a very quick and early sign that they’ve got a big problem, and it may well be a stroke.” The T is especially important — time to call 911: “It’s not time to dial my office. It’s not time to dial your neighbor. It’s not time to dial a relative. It’s time to dial 911,” Hicks says. Getting to a stroke team at a hospital quickly can limit the loss of brain tissue and expand options for treatments. Some of those treatments must be given within a few hours. “Timing is very, very important,” Hicks says. The biggest mistake people make is not calling for help immediately, Hicks says. “If it bothers you enough to think, Something’s not right with this person, then you should call 911,” Miller says. “I would rather go down [to the emergency department] 10 times to find out it’s nothing … than have somebody come in the next day with a stroke I can’t fix.” Though Shvetz’s children called 911, she says no one suspected a stroke until after she arrived at the hospital. Shvetz had to be moved to a second hospital that was better equipped to handle her stroke. That meant lost time.​​ Still, she was lucky. After brain surgery to stop the bleeding, followed by an induced 10-day coma, she gradually recovered over the following months, learning to speak, write and walk again. Today, she says her only remaining problem is some hearing loss resulting from the brain surgery. “I’m driving. I went back to work.” She walked a 5K in June. “Other than my hearing on my right side, I’m back to me.” Ingrid Wickelgren is a science journalist and author specializing in biology and medicine.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/heart-health-foods/#comments_widget_id,"12 Superfoods for Heart Health Add these to your grocery list to lower blood pressure, fight inflammation and slash stroke risk By Alison Gwinn, Updated February 20, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published June 07, 2023 / Updated February 20, 2025 Getty Images ﻿When it comes to heart health, you probably know what the American Heart Association (AHA) offers as its top diet advice: Eat a good balance of fresh, fiber-rich fruits and veggies; whole grains; and healthy proteins, such as nuts, skinless fish and poultry. But recent studies have also named specific cardiovascular all-stars that are worth adding to your rotation. Here are a few standouts to add to your grocery list. 1. Beets﻿ Why: Beets deserve a badge of honor in the veggie family. That’s due to their high doses of nitrates, which help keep blood vessels dilated﻿ and lower blood pressure. Plus they are packed with heart-healthy antioxidants, says Kate Patton, outpatient dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. .A 2018 review of a decade’s worth of studies identified beet juice consumption as an effective way to control blood pressure in both healthy and hypertensive adults. Also know: When it comes to heart health, it pays to see red — or orange or yellow. ﻿ ﻿ “I tell patients to get a variety of different colored foods,” says Patton. Try these other blushing nutrient-rich veggies and fruits: carrots, sweet potatoes, acorn squash, oranges, cantaloupe and papaya. 2. Pumpkin seeds and walnuts Why: A study presented in 2019 at the AHA’s Hypertension Scientific Sessions found that eating pumpkin seeds may help lower blood pressure. According to the AHA, pumpkin seeds are rich in fiber and a variety of nutrients, particularly heart-healthy magnesium (a quarter cup contains 42 percent of the mineral’s RDA). As for walnuts, a 2022 research review found that consuming foods like walnuts that are rich in alpha-linolenic acid was linked to a 10 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease. And 2021 research published in the American Heart Association’s journal Circulation found that eating a half-cup of walnuts a day for two years modestly lowered the subjects’ LDL cholesterol. “Walnuts are good sources of monounsaturated fats,” Patton says. “For people who don’t eat fish, they are a good way to get in those omega-3 fats.” Also know: “Any nuts are good sources of monounsaturated fats,” says Kate Patton, lead outpatient dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic. “For people who don’t eat fish, they are a good way to get in those omega-3 fats.” A 2019 study presented at the European Society of Cardiology showed that eating nuts two or more times a week was associated with a 17 percent lower risk of death from heart disease. But remember one word: moderation. These are calorie-dense foods, so keep portions modest and avoid added salt, sugars and oils. Penny Kris-Etherton, Pugh university professor of nutritional sciences emeritus at Pennsylvania State University advises limiting yourself each day to “an amount that will fit in the palm of your hand.” 3. Tofu ﻿ Why: “This plant-based soy protein contributes isoflavones and is a substitute for animal proteins to help support flood lipid levels,” says Linda Van Horn, chief of the nutrition division in the department of preventive medicine at Northeastern University. Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital reported in 2020 that a study of more than 200,000 people found a link between consuming isoflavone-rich tofu more than once a week and an 18 percent lower risk of heart disease. Beyond that, tofu is a great source of plant protein, so it’s a smart substitute for red meat or pork. “It also has phytosterols — plant cholesterols that actually improve the cholesterol in our own bodies,” Brenes-Salazar says.﻿ Beyond that, tofu is a great source of phytosterols — plant cholesterols that can block the absorption of cholesterol, says Patton. Also know: A 2021 Chinese study found that eating soy four or more days of the week was associated with a significantly lower risk of death from heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends one to two servings (or 5.5 ounces) f protein — from lean meat, chicken, eggs, fish, nuts or soy products — a day. Protein is especially important for aging bodies: “On average, most Americans consume enough protein, but older adults may have lower appetites and are at greater risk of muscle loss,” says Patton. 4. Olives and olive oils Why: If you’ve heard of the Mediterranean diet (and who hasn’t?), then you know all about olive oil. It not only boosts good, heart-protective cholesterol but also staves off diabetes and strokes. Recent research confirms its salubrious effects: A 2020 European study found that patients who had had heart attacks and subsequently followed a Mediterranean diet high in olive oil had better repair of the arterial linings; a 2022 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology﻿ found that consuming more than a half tablespoon of olive oil a day — or replacing about 10 grams a day of margarine, butter, mayonnaise or dairy fat with olive oil — is linked to a lower risk of death by heart disease. Try to follow the USDA guidelines of 27 grams (about two tablespoons) a day. “Remember,” Kris-Etherton says, “olive oil is calorically dense.” As for olives, make sure to buy the low-sodium variety, available at many big-box stores. ﻿ Also know: Other healthy oils for cooking: avocado, sunflower and canola oils, which have mostly healthy fats, says Patton. Getty Images 5. Garbanzo beans Why: First, they’re full of fiber, which can help lower your bad LDL cholesterol and are naturally low in sodium. Second, “beans are an underappreciated source of good-quality protein,” Brenes-Salazar notes. Adds Patton: “All members of the legume family are super healthy because they are full of plant-based protein and the kind of fiber that lowers cholesterol and helps to stabilize your blood sugar levels.” Also know: other heart-healthy legumes — pinto beans, red beans, kidney beans and black beans. And research indicates that eating about ¾ cup a day may even help you lose a little weight. But remember, canned beans can be high in salt, so either rinse them thoroughly in water or use dried beans. Getty Images 6. Avocados Why: “Despite avocados’ high fat content, the fat is heart healthy and monounsaturated,” says Christine Rosenbloom, a registered dietitian and coauthor of Food & Fitness After 50. “Avocado is also rich in fiber, potassium and magnesium, all nutrients associated with heart health. Avocados are sodium-free ... a plus for those with high blood pressure, and avocado oil has a high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it good for pan-searing foods.” A 2022 study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, of almost 70,000 women and more than 40,000 men — all free of coronary heart disease — linked a higher avocado intake with a lower risk of heart disease. Also know: Another study from Pennsylvania State University found that eating one avocado a day led to a slight decrease in unhealthy cholesterol. 7. Oatmeal Why: Touted for its healthy properties for a half-century, fiber-rich oatmeal cuts down on cholesterol absorption and contributes to gut health. “Oatmeal is a good source of healthy fiber, healthy fats and protein,” Patton explains. “Soluble fiber is really important for our digestive tract and keeping blood sugar levels stable.” A meta-analysis published in 2022 in the European Journal of Nutrition found that adding oats to the diet was linked to lower cholesterol levels. Also know: know: Because steel-cut oats, or Irish oatmeal, are less processed than other varieties, they have the most fiber — but remember they take longer to cook. ﻿ Oatmeal can be the foundation of a heart-healthy meal: “It provides an excellent platform for incorporating berries, chopped nuts, yogurt or other additions,” says Van Horn. 8. Whole-grain rices and quinoa﻿ Why: “The more a grain is kept intact, the more nutritional value it has,” says Patton. An analysis by the World Health Organization of about 40 years of studies on the health benefits of dietary fiber found it provided a 15 to 20 percent decrease in cardiovascular-related mortality, including heart disease, stroke, and type-2 diabetes. And whole grains can be good for weight, too: A 2021 Tufts University study found that middle- to older-age adults who ate at least three servings of whole grains daily saw smaller increases in waist size, as well as blood pressure and blood sugar. Also know: Whole-grain bread and cereal are also beneficial. But be wise when shopping. Look at the nutrition label and make sure “whole-grain” is the first ingredient — and watch for added sodium and sugars. “Typically, good whole-grain products have at least two and a half grams of fiber per serving, and less than 140 milligrams of sodium,” says Patton. ﻿9. Salmon Why: The AHA has long recommended eating fish — especially salmon and other oily fishes high in omega-3 fatty acids — twice a week to help stave off the risk of heart failure, stroke and other coronary disease. And a study published in 2022 in the AHA’s journal recommended eating three grams a day of omega-3 fatty acids like those found in salmon. It may not be just the omega-3s that are good for you; a 2018 study found that an ingredient in fish and other seafood called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) may also reduce hypertension-related symptoms. Also know The AHA recommends lake trout, herring, albacore tuna, sardines and mackerel. Should You Bother With Fish Oil?​ We've heard for years that fish oil supplements (and their omega-3 fatty acids) are magic pills against heart disease — in fact, at least 10 percent of Americans take them. However, recent research has cast doubt on their efficacy, including a study presented in November 2020 at the AHA's scientific meeting. It found that for 13,078 people who had heart disease (or were at high risk of it), fish oil pills did not reduce their risk of cardiac events compared with those on a placebo. Not only that, but atrial fibrillation, a potentially dangerous abnormal heart rhythm, occurred more often in those taking the supplement. The bottom line: Although eating fish regularly is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, supplements don't demonstrate the same effect as eating whole fish. ​​​​​ ﻿1﻿0. Blueberries Why: ﻿They’re the epitome of heart-healthy fruits, high in soluble fiber and polyphenols (those antioxidants that absorb free radicals) and vitamin C. A 2019 study out of London found that eating 200 grams of blueberries (about 1 1/4 cup, depending on the size) a day for a month led to lower blood pressure, and a second UK study found that eating 150 grams (about a cup) of blueberries a day lowered the risk of cardiovascular disease by 15 percent. Also know: All berries — strawberries, raspberries, blackberries — have heart-healthy credentials for their fiber as well as their flavonoids and antioxidants. Hate berries? Consider red grapes, which are high in resveratrol, a heart-healthy antioxidant. Getty Images 1﻿1. Broccoli and brussels sprouts Why: Though most veggies are great for cardiovascular health, broccoli and brussels sprouts are ace players. A 2020 Australian study found that these and other cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, are linked to a decline in blood vessel disease. They’re high in disease-fighting flavonoids and carotenoids as well as cholesterol-lowering fiber. Plus, like all veggies, their low caloric density means you can eat a lot without tipping the calorie scale. “You want to aim for such foods as part of a balanced diet because they're going to help with satiety,” Brenes-Salazar says. Also try: spinach, kale, baby greens, Swiss chard and collard greens. “The consensus is that three servings a day of dark-green leafy vegetables will reduce your total risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes,” Patton says. A 2021 study out of Edith Cowan University found that eating around two cup﻿s of nitrate-abundant leafy greens per day can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease by 12 to 26 percent. 1﻿2. Chili peppers Why: These hot little guys are high in a substance called capsaicin. It’s what sets your mouth on fire — but it also has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and blood-glucose-regulating effects. That’s good news for your heart: A 2020 study of 570,000 people found that those who ate chili peppers had a whopping 26 percent lower relative risk of cardiovascular mortality than those who rarely or never ate the peppers. Also know: What’s more, though not nearly as rich in capsaicin as the super-hot variety, sweet green and red peppers are also a good source of the mighty C. Should You Bother With Fish Oil?​ We've heard for years that fish oil supplements (and their omega-3 fatty acids) are magic pills against heart disease — in fact, at least 10 percent of Americans take them. However, recent research has cast doubt on their efficacy, including a study presented in November 2020 at the AHA's scientific meeting.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/difference-between-dementia-alzheimers/,"Prepare to Care View Series Dementia vs. Alzheimer’s: Which Is It? How to understand the difference — and why it matters By Kathleen Fifield, Updated May 09, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published June 15, 2020 / Updated May 09, 2023 Getty Images The terms “dementia” and “Alzheimer’s” have been around for more than a century, which means people have likely been mixing them up for that long, too. But knowing the difference is important. In the simplest terms, one is broader than the other. If the two were nesting dolls, Alzheimer’s would fit inside dementia, but not the other way around. While Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia (accounting for an estimated 60 to 80 percent of cases), there are several other types. The second most common form is vascular dementia, which is caused by decreased blood flow to the brain. Other types of dementia include Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia. In addition, certain medical conditions can cause serious memory problems that resemble dementia. A correct diagnosis means the right medicines, remedies and support. It could also impact clinical trial eligibility and participation. What it is Dementia In the simplest terms, dementia is a decline in mental function — thinking, remembering and reasoning — that is usually irreversible. It’s a syndrome, not a disease, notes neurologist Ron Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging in Rochester, Minnesota. The catchall phrase encompasses several disorders that cause chronic memory loss, personality changes or impaired reasoning, Alzheimer’s disease being just one of them, says Dan G. Blazer, M.D., a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at Duke University School of Medicine. To be called dementia, the disorder must be severe enough to interfere with your daily life, says psychiatrist Constantine George Lyketsos, M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer’s Treatment Center in Baltimore. What it’s not? Typical mild forgetfulness that sometimes accompanies aging — say, having trouble remembering the name of an acquaintance who comes up to you on the street. In fact, the earliest stage of dementia, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is considered “forgetfulness beyond what is expected from aging,” Petersen says. With MCI, a person is still functioning normally — paying her bills, driving well enough, doing his taxes — though performing some of those tasks may take longer than they used to. When someone starts to need regular assistance to do such daily activities, “that gets into the dementia range,” Petersen says. Alzheimer’s Alzheimer’s is a specific brain disease that progressively and irreversibly destroys memory and thinking skills. Age is the biggest risk factor for the disease. Eventually, Alzheimer’s disease takes away the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. To help determine whether patients have this particular brain disease, doctors talk to the patients and their close family members about any recent challenges or changes in behavior or memory. They also administer a mental status exam in an office setting, and possibly do a short neuro-psych evaluation. While a cure for Alzheimer’s remains elusive, researchers have made some progress when it comes to finding treatments that may be able to slow the progression of the disease. So far, two drugs have received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration. How it’s diagnosed Dementia A doctor must find that you have two cognitive or behavioral areas in decline to diagnose dementia. These areas are disorientation, disorganization, language impairment, mood change, personality change and memory loss. To make an evaluation, a doctor (often a specialist such as a psychiatrist, neurologist or geriatric medicine physician) typically takes a patient history and administers several mental-skill challenges. Thanks to growing medical consensus that irritability, depression and anxiety often flag dementia before memory issues do (and official changes to the diagnostic criteria to reflect this), doctors also ask more about changes in mood or personality, Lyketsos notes. To check for cognitive decline, a doctor will ask whether a patient is experiencing just forgetfulness or, potentially more indicative of dementia, also having trouble figuring out calculations such as a restaurant tip, Petersen says. A physical exam can be important for flagging something like specific types of dementia caused by vascular disease (strokes) or Parkinson’s disease. Next, a standard and fairly brief round of memory and thinking tests is given in the same office visit. In the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, for example, you try to memorize and then recall a list of 12 words — and a few similar words may be thrown in to challenge you. Another test — also used to evaluate driving skills — has you draw lines to connect a series of numbers and letters in a complicated sequence. Video: How I Discovered I Had Early-Onset Alzheimer's Alzheimer’s Doctors use several different methods to determine if an individual has Alzheimer’s disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. Physical and mental evaluations are often part of this process. Memory and problem-solving tests are also used. With Alzheimer’s in particular, the progression and timing of symptoms is important. To identify this degenerative brain disease, doctors are looking for “a gradual, insidious onset that is slowly getting worse,” Petersen says. Until fairly recently (before the early 2000s), a conclusive diagnosis was not possible until an autopsy was performed and the brain examined for the physical hallmarks of the disease — beta-amyloid and tau, proteins that look like plaques and tangles in the brain. Now, a patient can get a PET scan or cerebrospinal fluid sampling that can show, with high accuracy, whether such plaques or tangles are present. But a high percentage of patients never get such a test, doctors say. For one, these tests are invasive. They’re also expensive and typically are not covered by insurance, though this could change in the future as more Alzheimer’s treatments become available. Researchers are hopeful that faster, less-expensive tests will be available soon, like a blood test to diagnose the disease in the doctor’s office, or even to identify someone at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s. Editor’s Note: This story, last edited on June 15, 2020, has been updated to include new information pertaining to Alzheimer’s treatments.

It Could Be Norovirus What to do if you catch the highly contagious virus — and tips for avoiding it during outbreaks RealPeopleGroup / Getty Images By Rachel Nania, Updated January 02, 2025 AARP En español Published March 23, 2023 / Updated January 02, 2025 You’re fine one minute, and the next, it hits you: stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. You’ve got a stomach bug. And while a few different germs could be to blame, chances are it’s the dreaded norovirus, the most common cause of these symptoms. Each year, norovirus sickens about 20 million Americans and causes around 900 deaths, mostly among adults 65 and older. If it seems like you’re seeing more of it now, you’re not wrong. Cases surged in November and December of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And while norovirus outbreaks are most common between the months of November and April, the number of outbreaks recorded during the first week of December, the latest data available, was well above previous years. Common Symptoms of Norovirus Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain The very nature of norovirus makes it hard to dodge. For starters, the intestine-inflaming virus spreads quickly and easily among people; you can also pick it up from contaminated foods and surfaces. Plus, it’s what University of Maryland infectious disease physician Wilbur Chen describes as a “hearty” virus. It can survive on surfaces for long periods — we’re talking hours, even days. And it only takes a few virus particles to make you sick. Meanwhile, infected individuals can shed billions. Preventing norovirus Still, experts say there are a few steps you can take to help prevent a bout with the bug. And the most important is the most basic. “When talking about norovirus, and really any other virus, the best way to prevent yourself from getting sick is not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth unless you’ve washed your hands first,” says Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic. There’s a cringe factor to how norovirus is transmitted: by tiny particles of feces (poop) or vomit from an infected person. If someone has norovirus and doesn’t wash their hands after using the restroom and then goes to touch a doorknob, others can pick it up if they touch the doorknob and then touch their mouth. The same goes if that infected person shakes another individual’s hand or handles food. (Food like fruits and vegetables can also get contaminated when washed or grown with contaminated water.) Common Settings of Norovirus Outbreaks Health care facilities, including nursing homes Restaurants/catered events Schools and child care centers Cruise ships Source: CDC And an important note on cleaning your hands: “Alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't work so well against norovirus, so washing your hands well with soap and water is critical and important,” says Sabrina Assoumou, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of medicine at Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine. Soap and water — a vigorous scrub for about 20 seconds — can break up the virus’ structure much better than alcohol-based gels and sprays. If someone in your house comes down with norovirus, limit the amount of sharing that happens with food and utensils, Assoumou advises. And clean surfaces frequently and thoroughly. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a list of cleaning products that are effective against norovirus. You can also use a solution of 5 to 25 tablespoons of household bleach per gallon of water (2 percent to 10 percent), the CDC says. Finally, because norovirus is the leading cause of illness from contaminated food in the U.S., it’s important to wash fruits and vegetables and to cook oysters and other shellfish thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Common Symptoms of Norovirus Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain Common Settings of Norovirus Outbreaks Health care facilities, including nursing homes Restaurants/catered events Schools and child care centers Cruise ships Source: CDC What to do if you get it Unfortunately, if you do come down with norovirus, there’s no medicine to treat it. “The big thing is hydration,” Binnicker says. “That’s what’s going to put most people in the hospital with norovirus, is getting dehydrated.” About 465,000 people head to the emergency room each year with norovirus, and more than 100,000 are hospitalized with it. Water, sports drinks and over-the-counter rehydration drinks can help to replace fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhea, the CDC says. Just steer clear of anything with alcohol or caffeine. And pay attention to your symptoms — this is especially important for older adults, who are more susceptible to dehydration. If you start to feel dizzy or lightheaded or notice you haven’t urinated in a while, that could be a sign of severe dehydration, which requires medical attention. Another reason to see a doctor is if your symptoms don’t let up after a few days. The good news is, most of the time norovirus leaves as quickly as it comes on; people start to feel better within one to three days. That said, you can still spread the virus to others even a few days after you’re feeling fine, Binnicker says. “So, it’s really important, even after you get better, after you’ve stopped having symptoms, to continue to really be diligent about washing hands, especially if you’re in a household with other people,” he adds. More reason the keep up the hand hygiene: Immunity to norovirus is short-lived. Plus, there are different types of noroviruses, and infection with one will not protect you from another.

Did you know the condition can also be a serious risk to your health? Untreated sleep apnea has been linked to a number of health issues, including cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, dementia, type 2 diabetes and more. But despite these life-threatening risks, many aren’t aware that they’re vulnerable. The American Medical Association estimates that about 30 million people in the U.S. have sleep apnea, but only 6 million are diagnosed with the condition. Know the warning signs of sleep apnea Sleep apnea is often overlooked because its symptoms can be subtle. “The most obvious signs are snoring and waking up gasping for air — or being told by your partner that you do this — but there are other signs to be aware of, such as not waking up feeling rested, a morning headache that dissipates after you start moving around, difficulty concentrating or just not feeling as sharp as you used to,” says Eric Olson, M.D., a sleep specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. If you’re having trouble getting your blood pressure under control, even if you’re on multiple medications, that’s also a warning sign, he adds. Age is a big risk factor for the condition. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, fatty tissue can build up in your neck and the tongue as you age, increasing your risk of sleep apnea. “When people think of sleep apnea, they picture an obese male who snores, but this stereotype falls apart with age,” says Reena Mehra, M.D., a sleep specialist and the director of Sleep Disorders Research at the Cleveland Clinic. “Postmenopausal women, for example, have an increased likelihood when compared to premenopausal women.” Getting tested for sleep apnea If any of the above signs sound familiar, ask your primary care physician to refer you to a specialist so you can be evaluated. Most of the time, a sleep test is conducted overnight at a sleep center. As you get ready for bed, a technician places sensors on your scalp, temples, chest and legs, as well as a small clip on your finger or ear. These are all hooked up to a computer so that the lab can monitor your brain waves, eye movements, heart rate, breathing patterns and blood oxygen levels as you doze. If you’re wary of spending the night in a strange bed and being hooked up to an array of equipment (although some centers do them at hotels now, where you can snooze in luxury), then you can ask your doctor about doing a home test. In this case, you’ll simply pick up a small portable monitor at your local sleep center and then put it on at home. (This usually involves placing a belt around your chest, attaching a clip to your finger and putting an airflow sensor in your nose.) When you return the device, the technician analyzes the results. But keep in mind that such an at-home test will pick up sleep apnea only in the most severe cases. “If you’re a 65-year-old overweight man who snores, and your wife reports you sometimes stop breathing and gasp for air at night, then you have a high likelihood of having obstructive sleep apnea. And it’ll show up on a home test,” Mehra says. “But if you’re a 55-year-old thin woman, it may be less clear, and a home test may be inconclusive.” In that case, you’re better off going to a sleep center for the test. Treating sleep apnea If you’ve got sleep apnea, lifestyle changes such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol before bedtime and quitting smoking can help. But the gold standard of treatment is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), in which a mask connected to a pump blows air into your throat to keep the airway open. CPAP machine Getty Images If you wear one, a lot of the risks associated with sleep apnea can be dramatically reduced: A 2014 study published in the medical journal Sleep found that people who used a CPAP machine for just three months experienced a significant reduction in blood pressure. Other notable benefits include lower risk for heart attack and stroke, improved sleep quality and reduced daytime sleepiness, and possible improved sugar management for people with diabetes, according to the Cleveland Clinic. A 2016 review of studies published in the Journal of Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery, however, found that more than a third of all people prescribed a CPAP machine don’t stick with using one. “They can be uncomfortable to wear because they can cause symptoms like a stuffy nose or dry mouth,” Mehra says. “But if one mask doesn’t work for you, there are definitely other options.” CPAP machine Getty Images If you’re a mouth breather, for example, you may do better with a full-face mask that covers your mouth and nose. You can also opt for a CPAP-heated humidifier, which attaches to the air pressure machine to keep air moist, so you don’t wake up with a dry mouth. If you tend to get claustrophobic, look for a mask with a nasal pillow that fits under your nose so that it covers less of your face. “Like buying shoes, it can take a while to figure out the brand, size and style that you like,” Olson says. If you’ve tried several different masks and are still miserable, talk to your physician or provider about other options, such as a mouthpiece if you have mild sleep apnea, or even surgery if your apnea is severe. Help for snoring More than 37 million Americans snore regularly — meaning there’s an excellent chance that you or your partner keep one another up with awful buzz saw-like sounds. “As you get older, increased weight and/or decreased throat muscle tone can cause your throat to narrow during sleep and trigger snoring,” Olson says. Here’s how to find relief: Lose weight. Fat around your neck compresses your upper airway, triggering snoring, Olson says. Even shedding 5 to 10 pounds can help.Sleep on your side. When you lie on your back, your tongue falls backward, blocking your airways. To keep from rolling back onto your back when you snooze, place a T-shirt stuffed with tennis balls or old balled-up socks alongside you.Elevate your head. Propping up the head of your bed by four or more inches can take pressure off your airway so that it’s easier to breathe while you sleep.Try an OTC nasal strip. If your honking is caused by a stuffed-up nose, nasal irrigation with saline before bed may help. Then apply over-the-counter nasal strips to help keep nasal passages open, Olson advises. You may want to consider adding a humidifier to your bedroom in order to keep the air moist. You can also try an OTC prescription steroid spray if you have chronic congestion due to allergies.Don’t nod off with a nightcap. Alcohol relaxes throat muscles, which can trigger snoring. If you want to enjoy an evening cocktail, be sure to close down the bar at least three to four hours before bedtime. If your snoring doesn’t ease off despite these efforts and/or your snoring is accompanied by excessive daytime sleepiness (so you frequently find yourself nodding off, for example, when you sit down or even when driving a car), see your doctor to get evaluated for sleep apnea.

According to a new study, it can make you age faster too.﻿ The study, published recently in the journal Science Advances, shows that ongoing exposure to heat over 80 degrees accelerates biological aging, which is how your body ages on the inside at the cellular level, regardless of how many birthdays you’ve had. This might mean, for example, that instead of getting a specific health condition at a certain older age, it happens earlier, says Deborah Carr, director of the Center of Innovation in Social Science at Boston University, who studies heat and aging. “[It] means you [have] more years of suffering, more years of demands on your caregiver,” Carr explains. It also means you may not have Medicare in place to properly care for any premature health problems that arise, she notes. Heat’s impact on the aging process If you’re living in an area with extreme heat for half the year, you could be even more prone to faster aging, the study found. In fact, for people living in hot climates, biological aging sped up nearly three years in some cases. For the study, a team of researchers at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California used different biological clock models to measure markers of aging in blood samples from 3,686 American adults, ages 56 and older. The researchers then compared each individual’s aging outcomes, measured by slight changes in their DNA, with their geographical heat index, considering heat and humidity. Researchers categorized hot days as those that were 80 to 90 degrees, 90 to 103 degrees, and 103 to 124 degrees. They found that people who lived in areas that experienced more days of extreme heat were more likely to see greater increases in their biological age compared with people who experienced fewer hot days. “Participants living in areas where heat days, as defined as Extreme Caution or higher levels [90 degrees and up], occur half the year, such as Phoenix, Arizona, experienced up to 14 months of additional biological aging compared to those living in areas with fewer than 10 heat days per year,” study coauthor Eunyoung Choi said in a statement. “Even after controlling for several factors, we found this association. Just because you live in an area with more heat days, you’re aging faster biologically.” How heat affects your health Biological age varies for everyone because it’s based on how your cells age. Chronological age, meanwhile, refers to how long you’ve been alive. One of the ways s﻿﻿cientists measure biological age is based on methylation — a process that changes DNA. “When you have extreme heat or when you’re exposed to it, it causes stress to your body. That stress can manifest, particularly in your cells, by changes in your DNA,” explains Arnab Ghosh, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine who studies the effects of extreme heat on older adults. It’s not just heat that can affect a person’s biological age, Ghosh says. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking or having a condition like diabetes, can change it too. Some evidence suggests that accelerated biological aging could raise the risk of dementia; it has been linked with other health issues, too, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. Heat can also raise the risk of heart attack and stroke, according to research. Ghosh notes that heat can be harder on some older individuals, including people who take certain medications or have other chronic conditions. Women may also be more susceptible to complications from heat, according to a study published in 2024, which found that women ages 40 to 64 were as vulnerable to the effects of heat as men ages 65-plus. “Whether that [heat-related stress] leads [directly] to problems or aging or advanced aging is still an open question,” Ghosh says. And researchers aren’t sure if heat stress effects are permanent, he adds. Your personal heat baseline Being in 90-plus-degree weather isn’t a standard cutoff for when heat stress begins. Everyone has a different threshold, meaning you can still experience heat stress at 80 degrees, for example. People who live in warmer climates year-round may partly adapt to the heat naturally, but it can be harder during a heat wave. If you live in Arizona, for example, you may have a different baseline than someone who lives in Montana — a phenomenon known as acclimatization, Ghosh says. Everything from your behavior and age to chronic conditions and what you wear can influence your risk for heat stress, Ghosh says, and scientists don’t know the threshold for each person. A 2021 study showed that being in 75.2 degrees continuously without proper cooling can affect your body. “That can really have a significant wear and tear on the body, especially at night,” says Carr. A certain temperature can feel different in various places — it may be cooler near a beach but feel warmer in a city with little breeze, Carr says. Knowing your threshold can get complicated if you spend part of your year in a hotter area and the rest in a cooler climate, she adds. Plus, structures in areas that are warmer year-round likely have air conditioning, but that’s not the case in cooler areas, especially where older homes are common, Carr points out. 5 ways to ward off heat’s harmful health effects You can’t stop the temps from climbing, but there are a few ways to stay safe in the heat — and perhaps ease the heat stress that could make you age faster. 1. Stay alert. Watch the news or stay up to date on advisory warnings so you can adapt what you do, how you hydrate or what you wear, Ghosh says. “As temperatures warm up, people have to be more aware of the environment around them and adjust accordingly,” Ghosh adds. The first heat wave of the season can be the worst on health, he says. 2. Avoid extreme temps. The hottest time of the day is during midday hours— a good time to stay indoors in air conditioning, especially during a heat wave, Ghosh says. If you know you don’t do well in high heat, don’t run errands at the hottest times of the day. As you get older, you may not be able to do things at midday that you could do just a few years ago, Carr explains. “People really need to be mindful about altering their behaviors [when it’s hot],” Carr adds. 3. Watch your meds. Certain medications, such as those for high blood pressure or heart disease, may raise your risk for fainting in high heat. Know if any drugs or supplements you take could make you less tolerant to the heat, Ghosh says. Keep your medications out of the heat too, Carr adds, since exposure to varying temperatures can alter them chemically. 4. Keep cool at night. Sleep in a lower temperature to avoid heat stress — especially if you already have trouble sleeping, Carr says. 5. Plan for the heat. “Have a climate plan just the way you might have a will,” Carr advises. Know where you can go if you need to leave your home or what to do if you don’t have power due to high heat. “That can be really helpful, especially for older people,” Carr says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/age-and-alcohol/,"7 Reasons Why Age and Alcohol Don’t Mix Why your body doesn’t tolerate alcohol like it used to. Plus, a look at the latest health warnings By Sonya Collins, AARP Comments En español Published January 03, 2025 Getty Images As you add more candles to your birthday cakes, you may notice that your organs don’t work as efficiently as they once did. Your balance might not be as good, and your response time may not be as quick. Perhaps you have more aches and pains than you did last year. Just like your body inevitably changes with age, your drinking habits most likely need adjustments, too. That’s because with increasing age, “our bodies become more sensitive to the effects of alcohol,” says Kenneth Koncilja, M.D., an internal medicine physician at Cleveland Clinic. Plus, accumulating research finds that drinking alcohol comes with some serious health risks, particularly for older adults. Here are seven reasons why doctors and public health experts say age and alcohol don’t mix. 1. It takes less to get drunk Your liver processes alcohol, and like the rest of your body, this organ isn’t getting any younger. That’s a big reason an aging body becomes more sensitive to alcohol. “We also have changes in our body composition as we age,” says Lauren Kelly, M.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “We’re made up of less water and more fat.” That reduction in the body’s natural water content, in part because water-retaining muscle tissue shrinks, makes older people more prone to dehydration and more likely to feel drunker, quicker. “As you age, you get a higher blood alcohol concentration — what they measure on a breathalyzer — than a younger person who drank the same amount,” Koncilja says. And that means you can get hit with all the side effects in fewer sips. “That can include cognitive effects, sedative effects — like how you get sleepy with alcohol — effects on balance and coordination, raising your risk for falls﻿,”﻿ Koncilja adds. It can also include effects on attention and driving skills,﻿ he says. 2. Drinking can increase your risk of disease and death That drunk or tipsy feeling should clear up by the next day, maybe leaving you with a hangover. But the consequences of consuming alcohol can extend beyond that. A new advisory from United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, M.D., warns about the direct link between alcohol consumption and cancer. Alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the U.S., the advisory says, and drinking it increases a person's risk for seven types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, esophageal, liver, mouth, throat and larynx. When it comes to breast cancer, Murthy notes that more than 16 percent of cases in the U.S. are attributable to alcohol consumption. “Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States — greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the U.S. — yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,” Murthy said in a news release. In the advisory, he outlines recommendations to increase awareness of the health risks, including a call for warning labels on beverages that contain alcohol. In addition to this latest advisory, a recent study of more than 135,000 older adults, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that even as little as one drink a day raises the risk of death by any cause for older adults with pre-existing conditions or low socioeconomic status. And no one, regardless of health or socioeconomic status, was immune to the effects of more than one drink a day. In the study, those who had more than one drink a day had higher odds of death for any reason. Moderate drinkers (about 1.5 to 2.75 drinks a day for men and .75 to 1.5 drinks a day for women) also had a higher risk of cancer death. Heavy drinkers faced greater odds of both cancer- and heart-related death. It’s important to remember, Koncilja says, what “one drink” really is﻿: “It’s so easy to fall into that trap of thinking you’re only drinking one glass of wine. I don’t know how much people pour, but I don’t pour just five ounces."" The definition of one drink is: Beer and wine coolers: 12 ouncesWine: 5 ouncesLiquor: 1.5 ounces 3. Alcohol can worsen other chronic diseases If you already have a chronic health condition, drinking won’t do you any favors there either. “Older adults have higher rates of chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and combining that with alcohol increases risk for different problems related to those conditions,” Kelly says. Maintaining a healthy weight is key to preventing most of the chronic diseases that become more common as you age. This, of course, becomes more challenging after age 50 as your metabolism starts to slow down. Most booze is high in calories and carbs — the perfect formula to derail any weight management plan. “If you’re talking about having a healthy glycemic index and a low-carb lifestyle, alcohol doesn’t fit in,” Koncilja says. Given its high calorie and carbohydrate content, alcohol and diabetes don’t mix either. Whether you are living with diabetes or trying to prevent it, heavy drinking — more than three drinks a day or seven a week — will throw you off course. Drinking too much can raise your blood pressure, too, making it especially risky for people who already have hypertension. Once blood pressure goes up, so does the risk for heart attack and stroke. In fact, heavy drinking both raises risk for heart attack and stroke on its own and also indirectly by raising blood pressure. 4. Booze is bad for your bones Alcohol can wreak havoc on your bones, too. Your risk for osteoporosis — thinning, brittle, porous bones that break easily — increases with age. Calcium helps keep them strong, but too much drinking prevents your bones from absorbing this essential mineral. And there’s more. The older you get, the more likely you are to fall, which can be catastrophic if you’ve got brittle bones. Even sober, older adults are more prone to falls, so knocking back a few drinks can get extra dangerous. What might have been a tipsy stumble when you were younger, could become a hip-breaking disaster. 5. Alcohol can make you more susceptible to pain As you get older, you’re more likely to live with chronic pain and you may be more susceptible to depression. While either one of these conditions may make you want to pour yourself a drink, think twice before you do. “Alcohol is a facilitator of chronic pain,” Kelly says. “It can make people more sensitive to pain.” Alcohol plays a similar game of tug of war with depression and anxiety. “A lot of adults 50 and up are caring for their children and their parents,” Koncilija says. “Alcohol is an easy way to cope with the pressure, but it’s not a healthy way.” Heavy drinkers are more likely to have anxiety and depression than people who drink less. For some, it may be that depression and anxiety drive them to drink. For others, drinking too much may lead to depression and anxiety. 6. Drinking can disrupt your sleep When you throw sleep troubles into the mix, you get a really tangled web. Falling asleep and staying asleep become more challenging with age. Sure, a nightcap may help you relax and drift off, but as soon as the booze is through your system, you’re likely to wake up and struggle to get back to sleep. “Drinking decreases REM sleep,” Kelly says, “which is that deep, restorative sleep.” Poor sleep can exacerbate or raise your risk for a number of health conditions, including obesity, chronic pain, depression and dementia. What’s more, many of those conditions can keep you up at night, too. Alcohol only makes matters worse. 7. Alcohol can mess with your meds ﻿ Since we tend to accumulate more diagnoses as we get older, we often accumulate more prescriptions as we age. A report from the Lown Institute found that nearly half of older adults take five or more prescription drugs — and a lot of them may not go well with alcohol. With some medications, even a sip of alcohol is a no-no. With others, taking the medication too soon before or after a drink could put too much stress on your liver or cause sedation. The interactions that alcohol can have with medications vary greatly from one drug to the next and may also depend on your individual health. It’s crucial you ask your doctor or pharmacist whether there are any risks to drinking while taking your specific medications. If you want to cut back If you’re clocking more than seven drinks a week or more than three on any given day, doctors and health experts recommend changing your habits. Even if you haven’t hit that upper limit, you could benefit from drinking less as you get older. According to the World Health Organization, no level of alcohol consumption is considered safe. If you want to limit your drinking and you don’t know how, tell a friend or family member. “The more you talk about it, the more likely you are to hold yourself accountable to habit changes,” Koncilja says. And if you find it too difficult to stop drinking on your own, your doctor is there to help. “When people are struggling with their alcohol use, there are really helpful medications that doctors can prescribe,” Kelly says. “I encourage them to talk to their doctor.” If you want to cut back If you’re clocking more than seven drinks a week or more than three on any given day, doctors and health experts recommend changing your habits.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/health-and-weight-loss-70s/,"What Your Weight in Your 70s (and Beyond) Means for Your Health Here are some surprising truths about our changing bodies, and what those changes really mean to our health and longevity By Jessica Migala with Sari Harrar, Ginny Graves, Nicole Pajer and Beth Howard, AARP Comments En español Published May 17, 2023 ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHRISTINE RÖSCH When we were younger, staying lean was a common goal. But as we move into our 70s and beyond, we need to reassess the way we think about weight. Of course, obesity remains a major risk factor at any age, increasing our chances of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, joint problems and cancer. But how we think about our weight — and the steps we take to control it — needs to be a bit more nuanced. “Losing weight” isn’t always a smart goal. “Once you’re over 70, we worry about rapid weight loss, being underweight and sarcopenia [age-related muscle loss],” says Kristen DeCarlo, M.D., a geriatrician who practices in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at UI Health in Chicago. If you notice that you’re starting to drop pounds unintentionally, be aware that this downtrend may indicate muscle loss. Some research indicates that having a bit of extra weight on you as you age may, in fact, be protective. Doctors use the BMI (body mass index) scale as one measure of body fat to determine whether you’re underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese. (The easiest way to find your BMI: Go to aarp.org/bmi.) In a 2022 study, researchers found that the best BMI for health in those over 65 is 31 to 32 for women and 27 to 28 for men — higher than what’s recommended for people under 65. This is referred to as the obesity paradox, and exactly why it exists isn’t fully understood, says DeCarlo. Some studies show that people with higher BMIs in their 60s, 70s and older even had a lower dementia risk than people who were of normal weight or underweight, although why is a matter of debate. Since weight loss is a common characteristic of dementia, being thinner may simply be an indicator of the disease’s onset. That doesn’t mean ignoring your weight is OK. Quite the opposite: Paying attention to changes to your weight and body shape, as well as making a concerted effort to hold on to as much muscle as possible, can help you stay in a healthy range — so you can live well for years to come. 5 things happening to your body in your 70s It’s not just the scale that spins differently as we get older. Other changes to our physique are taking place, says Gitanjali Srivastava, M.D., medical director of Vanderbilt Obesity Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. 1. Muscle loss is accelerating. “As we get older, we may become frailer,” says Srivastava. “Not doing any weight training in your 50s or 60s leads to a lot of muscle mass loss that may be more noticeable now.” By the time you reach your eighth or ninth decade, half of your muscle mass may have vanished. Nearly one-third of adults over age 70 struggle with walking, getting out of a chair or climbing stairs, according to the National Institute on Aging. Resistance training, especially exercises aimed at the larger muscle groups in the body such as the butt and thighs, can help a great deal. Try air squats: Stand with your back to a sturdy chair, with your feet shoulder-width apart and your back straight. Now bend your knees and lower your butt as if to sit on the chair. But as soon as your butt touches the seat, immediately push up using your butt and thighs to return to a standing position. (Do one set of 35 repetitions, then eventually work up to four sets of 35.) Try to do this exercise three days per week; research shows that this regimen improves lower body function in older adults. 2. You may be losing weight but gaining fat “For reasonably healthy adults, there’s a natural increase in body fat until your 80s,” says DeCarlo. Muscle loss, plus hormonal changes and medication side effects, can contribute to you carrying around more fat than you did in your younger years. It’s generally believed that every pound lost is about 75 percent fat and 25 percent muscle, DeCarlo says. That’s why, rather than losing weight, “preventing weight gain should be the goal,” says cardiologist Carl J. Lavie, M.D., medical director of cardiac rehabilitation and prevention at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans. “There are some risks with losing weight, especially in elderly people, in their upper 70s and 80s. You want to keep good muscle strength as you get older. Physical activity and fitness are even more important than weight now.” “We see a lot of octogenarians who have obesity, are struggling to lose weight, but are also very frail and have multiple medical problems,” says Srivastava. Having more muscle mass — even if your weight puts you in the obese category — is protective; your doctor can assess you for sarcopenia and then make a recommendation from there. 3. Weight loss can happen unexpectedly Up to one in five older adults loses weight unintentionally, which is defined as losing 5 percent of one’s body weight within six to 12 months without a known cause (such as dieting, exercise or a medication side effect). This loss may be due to depression, anxiety, medications or even some cancers. No matter what your starting weight, if your clothes are suddenly mysteriously baggy, flag it for your doctor. 4. Your metabolism is slowing Since your 60s, your metabolism — the rate your body burns calories — has been sputtering. Your body requires fewer calories to keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing; having less muscle — metabolically active tissue that burns more calories than fat — also contributes to a more sluggish engine. In fact, in your 90s, you may burn only 75 percent as many calories as your middle-aged self. 5. Your face and your butt have become thinner Over the past few decades, some of the fat beneath your skin (subcutaneous fat) relocated to your abdomen, where it became visceral fat, says Srivastava. Visceral fat is the type that lives deep within your belly and hugs your stomach, liver and intestines. As a result, your butt, legs and arms may appear thinner and your face less full. “Patients talk about their skin feeling like paper; they report barely bumping themselves and getting a scrape,” says DeCarlo. Some of this, she explains, is a decrease in collagen and elastin, your skin’s support structures. Your weight and your risk of chronic disease Three out of four people in their 70s and even more in their 80s have some degree of cardiovascular disease, and older adults account for 80 percent of heart disease deaths. For many, it’s the result of years of high cholesterol, high blood pressure and/or high blood sugar. For others, it’s new damage, as aging stiffens arteries and heart valves, boosts blood pressure, and weakens your ticker’s ability to pump strong and keep a steady beat. A lifetime of carrying extra weight also takes a toll. “Excess body weight puts a strain on your heart that increases the risk for heart failure and atrial fibrillation [offbeat heart rhythms that boost stroke risk],” Lavie says. That said, where you carry the weight may matter more than how much you carry. While some fat under the skin may be protective, visceral fat can be toxic. “Visceral fat releases fatty molecules into the blood. And it’s invaded with immune cells called macrophages that create low levels of chronic inflammation in the body,” explains Jean-Pierre Després, a professor at Université Laval in Quebec City, Quebec, and a leading body fat and health researcher. Visceral fat can wrap around your heart and kidneys and infiltrate your liver, boosting risk for diabetes by interfering with your body’s ability to absorb blood sugar, says cardiologist Ian J. Neeland, M.D., codirector of the Center for Integrated and Novel Approaches in Vascular-Metabolic Disease at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. “It’s a big driver for cardiovascular disease.” Meanwhile, our immune system becomes more sluggish as we age, a problem compounded by excess fat. “Obesity is the silent killer of the immune system,” says David Bartlett, adjunct assistant professor of medicine at Duke University. Our immune system gradually declines from our 40s into our 70s, and then begins a precipitous drop in our 80s, leading to a decline in the production of effective antibodies that can neutralize viruses, says Laura Haynes, a professor of immunology at the UConn Center on Aging in Farmington, Connecticut. “The other thing that happens with age is an increase in systemic inflammation, which may be driven by increased body fat. The more fat you have, the more inflammation.” Inflammation disrupts the immune system as well as your hormonal system. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity is linked to at least 13 types of cancer. A combination of aerobic and strength training is the answer, says Bartlett. “A fair amount of observational data shows that if you’re physically active, you can improve your immune system, even if you start later in life,” he says. “Exercise moves cells around the body and into the blood, including dysfunctional T cells, which end up being cleared out of the body. In older athletes, we see a T cell profile similar to someone who is much younger.” How we think about weight As we reach age 70-plus, many of us are finding freedom at last from old body-shame stigmas. Surveys by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researchers found that women in their 70s were the least dissatisfied with their bodies and the least likely to say they thought about their weight every day — or several times a day. That said, disordered eating remains an issue for older people, says psychologist and body image researcher Lisa Kilpela, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Binge eating was a problem for up to 26 percent of women ages 60 to 83 in a recent study by Kilpela and others. “For the longest time, people didn’t think older women had eating disorders,” Kilpela says. “Older women who come to our lab say things like, ‘Thank you for thinking of us. We thought we’d be the forgotten ones because of our age.’ ” While there’s little research on body image in men over age 70, all of the participants in one University of British Columbia study of 28 men ages 65 to 83 said they felt grateful for what their bodies could do. Yet at the same time, most had frustrations about age-related changes, including muscle loss and extra pounds. At any age, though, your mental health can suffer if you struggle with body dissatisfaction. Paired with weight stigma, body dissatisfaction is associated with a higher risk for depression. In a 2021 study of 181 women ages 50 to 86, Kilpela also found that women with a negative body image got poorer sleep and had less social support. A negative body image is also associated with eating a less-healthy diet and getting less physical activity, says psychiatrist Debra Safer, M.D., the codirector of the Stanford Adult Eating and Weight Disorders Program at Stanford University in California. Regardless of how you look, or how you feel about how you look, discussing your weight with a health care provider is a smart idea. Our diet culture caters to young people; too few of us know about the positives, and negatives, of weight loss and weight gain after age 70, and what it all means for your unique shape. CHRISTINE RÖSCH 4 Healthy Weight Steps to Take Today Maintaining a healthy weight as we age — not too heavy, not too lean — is crucial to maintaining our independence. Here are some simple strategies that will keep you in shape while making sure you get the nutrition you need. 1. Start your day with protein Studies show that “protein timing” — eating 25 to 30 grams of protein in the morning and the same amount at lunch and dinner — helps people at midlife and beyond maintain muscle mass, which in turn reduces fat gain. 2. Choose farm foods over factory foods That means fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, seafood, olive and avocado oils, low-fat dairy and lean meat throughout the day. The fewer processed foods, the better. Foods in their natural form are the basis of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which are consistently rated as the best programs for weight management, heart health and longevity. 3. Move at least 30 minutes a day Daily active living beats having a few weekly gym sessions and sitting around the rest of the time. Aim for a total of at least 150 minutes of movement per week — walking swimming, biking, gardening — for cardiovascular fitness, and at least two days a week of resistance training for muscular strength. 4. Cut down on simple carbs, especially sugar Simple carbs like cookies and chips not only fill you up with calories while providing minimal nutrition, but a higher carbohydrate intake leads to water retention, making you look, feel and weigh heavier.

The article explores the complex relationship between weight and health in people over 70, challenging the conventional wisdom that being lean is always the healthiest goal. Research suggests that having a slightly higher body mass index (BMI) may be protective against certain health risks, such as dementia, in older adults. Key recommendations include maintaining muscle mass through resistance training, eating a balanced diet with adequate protein, and being mindful of changes in weight and body composition. A nuanced approach to weight management is necessary, as unintentional weight loss can be a sign of underlying health issues, and excess visceral fat can increase the risk of chronic diseases.",74

Health officials announce changes that will likely curb access to shots for some people under age 65 By Rachel Nania, Updated May 30, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published May 21, 2025 / Updated May 30, 2025 Getty Images U.S. health officials are proposing changes to recommendations for the coronavirus vaccine just months ahead of the fall vaccine season. The developments are raising new questions and creating some confusion about who could — and should — get the shot. Earlier this month, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, M.D., and FDA commissioner Martin Makary, M.D., published in article in the New England Journal of Medicine saying that rather than making the shots available to all individuals 6 months and older, like they have been for several years, the agency plans to limit COVID vaccine eligibility to adults 65 and older and individuals with at least one underlying health condition that increases their risk of severe illness from a coronavirus infection. Such conditions include asthma, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer and physical inactivity, among many others. The authors said that for people between the ages of 6 months and 64 years who don’t have any risk factors for severe COVID, “the FDA anticipates the need for randomized, controlled trial data” to evaluate the benefit of the vaccines before licensing them for younger populations. It’s important to note that the COVID-19 vaccine remains on the child immunization schedule for individuals ages 6 months to 17 years, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that children and their parents can receive the vaccine in consultation with their doctor — a process known as shared decision-making. Days after the journal article was published, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., said on social media that the vaccine would also no longer be recommended for healthy pregnant women, despite pregnancy being a risk factor for severe illness. Doctors familiar with the framework say it’s unclear how changes in the vaccine policy would affect insurance coverage for individuals under the age of 65 who have no risk factors. Typically, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel of independent experts that advises the CDC, recommends how federally approved vaccines should be used. Insurers are required to cover certain vaccines recommended by ACIP and adopted by the CDC. Changes raise questions for adults under 65 Federal data highlights the heightened risks of the coronavirus for adults 65 and older. Since the start of the pandemic, about 77 percent of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in adults 65 and older, data from the CDC shows, and hospitalization rates for this age group are much higher than those for younger populations. Still, roughly 17 percent of COVID deaths have occurred in adults ages 50 to 64, and about 5.5 percent in people ages 30 to 49. Robert H. Hopkins Jr., M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, says the changes could “raise, potentially, additional concerns in the health care professional community about the value of vaccinating people at all who are under 65, if they don't have major health conditions.” What’s more, Hopkins adds, the framework excludes people who want to get the vaccine to reduce their risk of long COVID, which affects more than 20 million Americans. According to the CDC, research shows that COVID vaccination is the best way to prevent long COVID, including in children. “There’s an implication that [the vaccine] is not effective, and we know it’s effective,” says Rebecca Wurtz, M.D., an infectious disease physician and a professor in health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. According to a CDC study, the vaccines averted approximately 68,000 hospitalizations during the 2023–2024 respiratory virus season. Wurtz says the shift could also put more responsibility on patients under 65 to familiarize themselves with all the conditions that can increase their risk of severe illness and communicate those conditions to their doctor, especially since it’s unlikely clinical trial data will be available in time for the fall vaccine season. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “The risk factors [outlined by the CDC] are conditions that many people ages 50 to 65 share,” Wurtz says, pointing to obesity as one and trouble hearing as another. Federal research shows that 28 percent of adults 50 and older are physically inactive — another key risk factor for severe COVID-19. Another concern among some doctors: The change proposed in the New England Journal of Medicine article ignores young children, who are not immune to the effects of COVID-19. According to an analysis of data from the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 234,000 children under age 18 were hospitalized with COVID-19 from the fall of 2020 to the spring of 2024. And children ages 0-4 accounted for 58 percent of the confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions from January 2022 to April 2024, the same analysis found. “We’re not talking about and thinking about that relationship between, you know, teachers and health care providers and grandparents getting COVID and transmitting it to their non-immune grandchildren or patients or students,” Wurtz says. CDC data shows that about 13 percent of U.S. children under the age of 18 got the COVID-19 vaccine in the 2024-2025 respiratory illness season. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Reducing your COVID risk It’s unclear when any outlined changes will take effect. In the meantime, Wurtz says, adults 65 and older who are concerned about getting sick from the virus this summer can get a spring booster, as recommended by the CDC. Individuals who are moderately or severely immunocompromised are also eligible for a spring shot. “We know that immunity wanes over the space of four to six months. And we also know that COVID is a year-round condition, not an influenza-patterned condition,” Wurtz says. “[The vaccine] is safe, it’s effective, it’s covered by insurance, and it’s available at drugstores. And I think people [65 and older] should be reminded to get that booster.” For people under 65 who are not eligible for a spring shot, washing hands often and cleaning frequently touched surfaces can help reduce the risk of getting sick. Opting for outdoor activities over indoor ones and wearing a high-quality mask in public indoor areas can also help. “We have to recognize that COVID-19 is still here with us,” Hopkins says. “It’s still causing thousands of deaths a year. It’s causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations a year. Those numbers are less each year as we come through the pandemic, but as long as the virus continues to circulate, we’re still going to generate new variants.” Editor's note: This story, first published May 21, 2025, has been updated to reflect new information.

Pickleball, a mash-up of ping-pong, tennis and badminton, is the fastest-growing sport in the country, with 8.9 million players volleying and “dinking” at courts across the nation, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. The association says participation in the sport increased by a whopping 15﻿9 percent over three years. The sport’s name, legend has it, stems either from a cocker spaniel owned by one of the founders or the pickle boat of crew races. It’s played on a small court — one tennis court can be subdivided into four pickleball courts — with two teams of two people per team. Pickleball players, fondly referred to as picklers, have taken to the courts with a fierce zeal. The sport’s instantaneous appeal can be chalked up to its preternaturally low barrier to entry. The time between learning the game and having a blast with it can be as brief as an hour. You can even play if you are in a wheelchair (with slightly different rules). Strains and sprains rising The benefits to pickleball are numerous, from exercise and mental acuity to social connection and purpose. In the shadows of its meteoric rise, however, lies a wake of pickleball-related injuries. Pickleball is categorized as a low-impact and mild-intensity sport, but pickleball injuries are growing. One analysis published in 2021 in Injury Epidemiology estimated that there were nearly 29,000 pickleball injuries from 2010 to 2019. About 60 percent were strains, sprains and fractures, according to the study, and 85 percent of those visiting emergency rooms because of a pickleball injury were over age 60. Wrist and lower leg injuries were most common, the study found, followed by head, lower trunk, ankle, knee and shoulder. Injuries were mainly due to slips, trips, falls and dives. Although injuries are becoming more commonplace, they are still a mere fraction relative to the legions of players who remain unscathed. “Pickleball overall is a very safe sport. Compared to other sports, the injury rate per minute is much lower, ” says Bruce Moseley, an orthopedic surgeon at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. But as with any sport, the more people play, the more injuries will occur. Compared to tennis, says Moseley, “pickleball is more stepping and moving than jumping and running. This is great for your joints and muscles. People can tolerate it better.” The rackets are smaller, lighter and less cumbersome than tennis rackets, and the whiffle-type ball made from plastic is easier to hit. “By far the most effective way to protect against these injuries is to stretch and warm up beforehand,” Moseley says. Many of these injuries could be prevented by stretching the fronts and backs of the leg, the trunk and the lower back, he adds. So there’s no need to retire your racket — just add a brief warm-up to your pickleball playbook, and chances are you will be all set. Let’s Play Pickleball! Become a part of the country’s fastest growing sport. Learn the rules, tips for playing and ways to win. Plus, how to warm up, what to wear and where to play. Read more about the joy of pickleball Exercises to prevent pickleball injuries AARP asked Lee Whitwell, reigning MVP of Major League Pickleball (MLP), to design our pickleball dynamic stretching routine. Whitwell grew up playing tennis, became a Division II national champion and went on to play professionally. She picked up a pickleball paddle for the first time in 2017 and soon after participated in her inaugural pickleball tournament — and won. She competes professionally and is a huge advocate of the game, which she sees as offering not just a great workout but a third space, similar to the one that church occupies, beyond work and home. “It’s so inclusive and so accepting,” she says. ﻿“Nobody cares whether you are Black, white, male, female, old, young, Democrat, Republican, able-bodied, not able-bodied. It doesn’t matter. They just want to go out there and have fun﻿.” But to keep having fun and play for prolonged periods for days on end, players need to consider how to prepare the body for pickleball. To that end, Whitwell created a roughly five-minute dynamic workout she wants you to do before your first game, and after any break in the action longer than an hour. Try this dynamic warm-up designed to prep your body for pickleball and prevent injuries. Lee Whitwell’s 5-minute dynamic stretching routine 1. March in place This is done to get the body moving and the blood flowing. It gets your heart rate up without straining the joints and prepares the body for more strenuous tasks. Stand straight with your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle and your feet hip-width apart.Bring you left knee up and right elbow forward at the same time.Repeat on the opposite side and keep marching in place for one minute. Lee Whitwell recommends players do a dynamic stretching workout before each game to help prevent pickleball injuries. Christopher Gregory-Rivera 2. Squats Body-weight squats help warm up the glutes and hip flexor muscles, the quadriceps, abs, calves and hamstrings. Being loose in these areas is key for pickleball, which demands quick footwork and a ready position (knees slightly bent and body weight on the balls of your feet). Keep your feet shoulder-width apart.Keep the weight over the balls of your feet (avoid raising the toes or the heels).Keep your knees in line with the toes as you lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Keep the torso lifted and the top of your head reaching upward, as if you were going to sit on a chair. Maintain a neutral spine throughout the squat.Press through your feet to extend your legs and return to standing.Do 10-15 squats. 3. Reverse lunges The lunge requires strength, balance and a stable core. It conditions your hips, knees and ankles, preparing your body for the lunges in various directions pickleball requires. With feet hip-width apart, stand as if you were on railroad tracks.Maintain good posture with your back straight, chest lifted and eyes straight ahead.Shift your weight into your left foot as you step your right foot backward, planting your weight in the ball of your foot. Make sure your front and back feet line up with your hips.Lower your body straight down by bending both knees to about 90 degrees, or as far down as you can comfortably go. Your back knee should not touch the floor. Make sure your front knee does not extend over your front foot.Reset your feet back together and lunge your other leg behind you, alternating so you do five lunges on each leg. Lee Whitwell recommends players do a dynamic stretching workout before each game to help prevent pickleball injuries. Christopher Gregory-Rivera 4. Kickers Kicks improve the flexibility of the hamstrings. Hamstring injuries, often caused by sudden movements, are common in pickleball. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your arms by your sides.Lift one leg straight in front of you while reaching for it with your opposite hand.Maintain an upright posture, avoiding leaning forward or back.Lower your lifted leg and repeat with the opposite leg and arm. Continue alternating sides, doing five kicks on each side.

The organization’s sponsorship includes free clinics at each tour stop for members to learn pickleball from APP pros, instructional videos about the sport and inspirational stories about how pickleball has transformed people’s lives. 5. Trunk rotations Because they increase the flexibility of your spine, trunk rotations can ward off lower back strain, often associated with the forward bending that striking the ball entails. Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and facing forward.Slowly start to twist your upper body to the right, gently swinging your arms, which are bent at the elbows rather than fully extended. Keep your head, chest and torso in one vertical line as you move.Hold the rotation for a moment once you’ve moved as far right as you can safely go. Then, begin to slowly rotate to the left.Repeat the motion on the left side, then return to the right in one continuous movement, doing five reps on each side. 6. Chest openers This exercise lengthens and stretches the muscles of the chest, torso and front of the shoulders. Stand up tall.Cross your arms over each other in the front of your chest, squeezing your should blades apart.Then draw your arms out and back. Repeat 10 times.Add a variation. Instead of keeping your arms level, move your arms out diagonally, each time reversing the diagonal. Do this five times on each side. 7. Swim strokes The most common pickleball injury, says Mosely, is a rotator cuff tear. This causes shoulder pain, especially with movement and use. Warming up the range of motion of your shoulders can help prevent this painful injury. Hinge slightly at the hips, knees bent.Pretend you are doing a crawl stroke, like you are swimming forward in imaginary water.Then move your arms backward, circling your arms like you are doing a backstroke.

https://www.aarp.org/health/brain-health/alzheimers-diagnosis-before-symptoms/#comments_widget_id,"Is It Too Soon to Diagnose Alzheimer’s in People With No Symptoms? Some say new criteria could spark worry before life-saving therapies are available By Esther Landhuis, AARP Reviewed by Jason Karlawish, M.D. Comments En español Published March 05, 2025 Getty Images Would you want to know you have Alzheimer’s disease years before symptoms of memory loss and confusion set in? An expert committee says that’s now possible. According to their new criteria, published last June, a doctor can diagnose the disease purely from the results of a brain scan, a spinal tap or a simple blood test. Like cancer, diabetes and other illnesses that are routinely detected by biological markers in people with no symptoms, Alzheimer’s can be traced to an abnormal buildup of two proteins — amyloid and tau — well in advance of any changes in memory, personality or behavior that might emerge years later. But just because it’s possible to detect those markers of Alzheimer’s, does it make sense to do so? And what does this label mean for a person who may or may not ever experience symptoms at a time when few treatment options exist? Earlier diagnosis doesn’t guarantee better outcomes First, some context: The new diagnostic criteria are not surprising. They come on the heels of two milestones — the availability of new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration as disease-slowing treatments, and research showing that new blood tests are reliable, which expands the options for diagnosing the disease. Blood tests are much cheaper and easier to administer than brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and can detect disease biology about as well. In fact, blood tests can identify people with early-stage Alzheimer’s more accurately than standard evaluations by primary care physicians and even dementia specialists. A leading blood test measures both Alzheimer’s biomarkers — a modified form of the protein tau, called p-tau217, and several versions of amyloid (amyloid-β 42 and amyloid-β 40). Amyloid accumulates very early in the disease; p-tau217 shows up later, at a stage of disease when neurons are dying. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits So the question of whether doctors can diagnose Alzheimer’s just from biological markers is “an undisputed yes,” says Andrew Budson, M.D., professor of neurology at Boston University and director of the Center for Translational Cognitive Neuroscience at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System. “You can, in the same way that you can diagnose cancer with a mammogram or colonoscopy.” But can does not mean should. To be clear, even the authors of the new diagnostic criteria, the Alzheimer’s Association Workgroup, say they don’t recommend blood tests for people who show no signs of cognitive impairment, although that nuance is somewhat buried in the report. That’s in large part because the medications that reduce levels of amyloid in the brain — Leqembi (lecanemab) and Kisunla (donanemab) — have only shown benefits in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild-stage dementia, and their potential side effects can be serious. To date, “we have zero evidence … that treating people with just amyloid in their brain leads to any positive outcome,” says Eric Widera, M.D., professor of medicine and clinician-educator in geriatric medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Those studies, called AHEAD and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, described below, are happening now. Widera is a member of the International Working Group, or IWG, researchers from 17 countries who published a 2024 paper in JAMA Neurology cautioning against diagnosing people with Alzheimer’s disease based solely on biology without signs of dementia. The IWG and others warn that the availability of blood tests can cause undue worry for people who test positive without getting appropriate counseling on how to interpret the results. “They’ll be confused because they’ll know they don’t have Alzheimer’s dementia … but they’ll start to notice every problem with their memory,” says Deborah Blacker, M.D., geriatric psychiatrist and epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. In reality, not every memory blip is cause for concern; some are due to inattentiveness (you lost your keys because you were distracted when you walked in the door), or lack of sleep or even certain medications. Importantly, most people with amyloid in their brain make it through life free of dementia. Having tau in the brain increases risk, but not to 100 percent. In a 2018 computer modeling study that estimated probabilities of disease progression based on amyloid status and other factors such as age and national death rates, fewer than 1 in 4 cognitively normal 75-year-old women who test positive for amyloid go on to develop Alzheimer’s dementia during their lifetime. For men at the same age, that figure is 1 in 5. It’s been known for decades that many who die with normal cognition have “a head full of amyloid,” Blacker says. For a 75-year-old woman with both amyloid and tau in her brain, the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s dementia is closer to 1 in 3. “There’s a lot that needs to go wrong for something as important as cognition to fail,” adds Fanny Elahi, M.D., a neurologist-scientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “We actually are very resilient.” Test results may cause unnecessary alarm When people hear “Alzheimer’s disease,” most imagine the dreadful condition that robs a person’s memory and thinking skills — not an abnormal test result. A blood test measures biology, Elahi says. “It doesn’t equate to dementia. It doesn’t mean [those testing positive] are ‘doomed.’ ” Still, the psychological impact of biomarker tests on people with no apparent impairment is murky. Some worry that disclosing test results may invite possible discrimination in employment, housing and insurance. But since “we know there is biology that contributes to Alzheimer’s-related dementia,” she adds, a test tells someone they are at higher risk for dementia. What the test cannot measure is when someone might develop a life-altering disease — or whether they will at all. While a positive test doesn’t signify Alzheimer’s-related dementia, “a negative test doesn’t mean you won’t develop a different neurodegenerative disorder,” Daniel Press, a cognitive neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote in an email. “I guess my main advice would be to talk it through with an expert before getting [a test].” Some scientists liken the Alzheimer’s blood test to a PSA test, which detects a protein whose high levels could signal prostate cancer, yet often isn’t cause for alarm. Since many prostate tumors grow slowly, “more people die with prostate cancer than from it,” Blacker says. Similarly, Elahi perceives the buildup of amyloid — as well as tau — as a lifelong continuum. “Everyone who lives is on that continuum,” she says. The big unknown is how long it will take these proteins to reach a tipping point and trigger dementia. For one person it could happen when they’re 50 years old, for another at age 90, and for another never, Elahi says. A major benefit of identifying people at early stages of disease is that this is when they’re most likely to respond to treatments being tested in clinical research studies — and while there’s still time to make lifestyle changes. There is accumulating research suggesting that everyday actions — such as ongoing exercise, healthy eating and managing stress — can reduce a person’s risk of dementia. If a test result will move a person to change their lifestyle, there’s benefit, Elahi says. But if it causes someone to become depressed and lose hope, that’s not helpful. The psychological impacts are important. As is how the test results are used. “This, I think, is true for every diagnostic test that has ever become available. Interpretation … and communication of what that result means is everything,” she says. The AHEAD study aims to address the question of whether the disease-slowing drug Leqembi might work for people with no symptoms. The National Institutes of Health and Eisai, one of the drug’s developers, are funding the research. Enrollment closed in September 2024, with more than 1,600 people ages 55 to 80, who are amyloid-positive but show no signs of cognitive decline, randomly assigned to receive infusions of either Leqembi or a placebo once every two to four weeks for four years. Results are expected by late 2028 or early 2029. A similar study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, is testing Kisunla in people with “preclinical Alzheimer’s,” described as no cognitive decline but signs of amyloid and tau in their brain. ​Esther Landhuis is a science and health journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area who formerly covered Alzheimer’s and other degenerative diseases for Alzforum.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/age-related-eye-issues/,"Top 11 Age-Related Eye Problems Early detection of the most common eye diseases in older adults can keep you seeing clearly By Barbara Stepko and Jessica Migala, Updated September 12, 2024 AARP Reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published September 02, 2020 / Updated September 12, 2024 Getty Images While some eye problems common with age are mere annoyances, others are diseases that can lead to permanent vision loss if left untreated. The key to prevention is early detection. Make time for regular eye exams, and look out for these 11 age-related eye problems. More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health 1. Dry eye After the age of 40, tear production tends to decline. As a result, 1 in 8 people over 65 have dry eye disease. Symptoms include: Eye discomfort.Irritation.Blurry vision. A dilated eye exam can help to diagnose dry eye. Your doctor may ask about symptoms and do further testing to confirm the diagnosis, including the Schirmer test, in which the doctor places a small piece of filter paper in your eye to measure tear production. Over-the-counter eye drops and lifestyle changes (such as taking breaks from screen time) can be helpful for mild dry eye. Low humidity can make dry eye worse, so adding a humidifier to your home in the winter may help. You may want to ask your doctor if any medications you take contribute to dry eye. 2. Floaters More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health Those tiny specks, strings and squiggles are usually harmless, caused by normal age-related changes in the vitreous, a gel-like fluid that fills the back of our eyes. If floater changes are minor or gradual, there is less cause for concern. But if you notice an increase in the number of floaters — or a sudden onset — see your eye doctor pronto. It could be a warning sign of something more serious, such as a detached retina. 3. Cataracts Cataracts are among the most prevalent eye conditions in older people. More than half of Americans 80 and older either have cataracts or had surgery to correct them. The result of proteins in the lens breaking down as we age, cataracts can cause blurred or cloudy vision. You’re at higher risk if you: Are white (by age 80, 70 percent of white people have cataracts, compared with 53 percent of Black people, according to the National Institutes of Health).Have diabetes.Spent lots of time in the sun over the years.Use certain medications, such as corticosteroids. If cataracts interfere with common activities, such as nighttime driving, your eye doctor may recommend surgery, trading the clouded lens for an artificial one. 4. Trichiasis Fuse/Getty Images Trichiasis is a condition in which the eyelid skin loses elasticity and the eyelashes grow inward, toward the eye. The lashes can rub against the cornea or the conjunctiva (the thin inner surface of the lids), leading to irritation, redness, tearing, light sensitivity and corneal abrasion. Trichiasis can develop because of an eye infection or trauma to the eye. 5. Eyestrain When your eyes get fatigued from overuse, they can feel dry, itchy, achy and tired — they may also sting. Driving long distances, uncorrected vision or struggling to see in dim light could be culprits, but perhaps the most common cause of eyestrain is extended use of digital devices. Recent data suggests that two-thirds of people experience digital eyestrain from using their phones, computers or other devices for nearly 10 hours per day. (Working from home seems to make you more prone to eyestrain.) Discomfort usually eases once you rest your eyes. Other remedies include: Blinking more often.Following the 20-20-20 rule (for every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds).Using lubricating eye drops. 6. Blepharitis This strange-sounding name is for a very common condition in which the rims of the eyelids become inflamed. Blepharitis is believed to be associated with bacteria on the eyelid or dandruff, and it’s more frequent among people with skin conditions such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and rosacea. Although people of any age can have blepharitis, being over 50 puts you at a higher risk. Getty Images One of the major causes of blepharitis in the older population is the presence of demodex, microscopic mites that hang out in the follicles of the eyelashes. In a study of older adults, 70 percent had these mites, along with dryness, itching, irritation and pain. In many cases, blepharitis can be controlled with: Daily washing near the lash line.Warm compresses.Addressing an underlying skin condition. 7. Watery eyes The official medical name for watery eyes is epiphora. Changes associated with age, including eyelid drooping and blocked tear ducts, can make watery eyes more likely. Ironically, dry eye is also a frequent cause of watery eyes (the dryness prompts glands to produce more tears). In research on adults, more than half of people visiting a clinic with watery eyes were over age 60. What are the more serious age-related eye problems? Getty 8. Glaucoma One of the leading causes of blindness in people over 60, glaucoma usually is the result of fluid not draining properly, leading to a buildup of pressure that can damage the optic nerve. Painless and stealthy — it’s referred to as the “silent thief of sight” — the condition affects 3 million Americans, but only half know they have it. Glaucoma often affects both eyes — though usually not at the same time — and can cause loss of peripheral vision and, with no intervention, total blindness. 9. Age-related macular degeneration Getty Images Another leading cause of vision loss, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects almost 20 million Americans. This disease damages the macula, at the center of the retina, responsible for our straight-ahead vision and most of our color vision. As the disease progresses, it can cause blurred or wavy vision and eventually central vision loss. There are two kinds of AMD: dry and wet. Most people have dry AMD, in which parts of the macula become thin and small clumps of protein called drusen grow, clouding central vision. At late stages, this can turn into wet AMD, in which abnormal blood vessels grow beneath the macula and lead to fluid and blood leakage. There is no known cure, but there are ways to lower your risk and, possibly, slow the disease’s progression, including maintaining a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking and protecting your eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays. Eye doctors look for AMD during a comprehensive vision exam. An eye scan showing macular degeneration. Peter Dazeley/Getty Images 10. Diabetic retinopathy A condition found in people with type 1 or 2 diabetes, diabetic retinopathy occurs when excess glucose damages blood vessels in the retina. One recent study estimated that nearly 10 million people in the U.S. have diabetic retinopathy, which amounts to 1 in 4 people with diabetes having the disease. The damaged blood vessels can swell and leak blood and other fluids into the retina, causing cloudy vision and sometimes floaters or blurriness. As symptoms increase in severity, you may experience dark spots or empty areas in your vision, or even vision loss. If you are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, get a dilated eye exam within five years; for those with type 2, make an appointment with your ophthalmologist or optometrist right away. Keeping your diabetes under control and monitoring your eye health through regular exams is the best way to preserve your sight. 11. Detached retina This condition occurs when the retina separates from its underlying support at the back of the eye. As we get older, the vitreous (a gel-like fluid in our eye) undergoes a change in texture and shrinks; sometimes this leads to the retina becoming detached. Research shows that this becomes more common in our 50s and 60s. You may be more at risk for retinal detachment if you have: Diabetic retinopathy.A history of cataract surgery.An eye injury. Getty Images Retinal detachment isn’t painful, but the longer it goes untreated, the greater the risk of permanent vision loss. Retinal detachment is considered a medical emergency. If you notice warning signs — the sudden appearance of many floaters and flashes, diminished vision or the sensation of a shadowy curtain lowered over your eyes — contact an ophthalmologist right away. Your doctor can verify this via an eye exam. Fuse/Getty Images Getty Images Getty Getty Images An eye scan showing macular degeneration.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2017/bmi_calculator.html,"BMI Calculator Your BMI — a ratio of your weight to your height — helps to determine if you are at a healthy weight Beth Howard, Updated December 23, 2024 AARP En español Published April 20, 2023 / Updated December 23, 2024 This information is for educational purposes only — it’s not intended to provide specific health advice. We don't guarantee the accuracy of the tool and recommend consulting your doctor or health care provider regarding your particular situation. Your body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of your body fat that is based on your height and weight. Some doctors use BMI, along with other health indicators, to assess an person’s current health status and potential health risks. People with higher BMIs are more likely to develop chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and heart disease. To determine your own BMI, use this calculator. BMI calculator results are grouped into the broad categories: underweight, healthy weight, overweight and obesity. As you review your results, keep in mind that BMI has limitations, and should not be used to assess a child’s weight because the appropriate weight for children varies significantly by age. Learn more about how age and race might affect BMI results in our FAQ, below. If you have questions or concerns about your BMI results, talk to your doctor or health care provider. It’s important to know that many factors besides BMI — including family history, eating habits and activity levels — also affect your overall health. Learn more about losing weight naturally and healthily. Body Mass Index (BMI) FAQs Open All What is BMI? BMI, or body mass index, is a screening tool that takes into account a person’s height and weight. It slots people into four weight groups (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obesity) that may be linked to health problems. But BMI doesn’t directly measure a person’s health. The BMI should be used along with other measures, including your level of physical activity, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, to assess your risks for disease. What is a healthy BMI? The healthy weight category is defined as a BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9. A weight in this category is linked to fewer health problems than the underweight, overweight and obesity categories. What should my BMI be? The healthy weight category — defined as a BMI of between 18.5 to 24.9 — is considered ideal. But keep in mind that BMI is not a perfect measure. For example, it does not take into account how much fat you carry or where the fat is distributed, factors that can affect your metabolic health. How is BMI calculated? Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. How accurate is BMI? That depends. BMI can’t tell how much of your weight is from fat or muscle, so it misses information important to assessing your health risks. For instance, athletes can have a high BMI because of their muscle mass, even if they’re not overweight. Also, the definitions for the weight categories are based primarily on white populations, so it may be less accurate for people of other races and ethnicities. How can age or race affect BMI? BMI doesn’t differentiate between fat, bone and muscle; therefore, it may be less accurate for older people, who tend to lose muscle mass and bone density as they age. (That’s why people over 65 may benefit from a slightly higher BMI, between 25 and 27.) Research shows that the BMI definition of obesity overestimates risk in Black people and underestimates it in individuals of Asian descent, which may lead to inappropriate treatment and health disparities.

However, while it’s generally safe for drinking, tap water is not sterile, and there are a few situations in which using water straight from the faucet could endanger your health, according to experts and a CDC report published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. 5 uses where tap water can be risky Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machinesNasal irrigation devices including neti pots, bulb syringes, squeeze bottles and battery-operated pulsed water devicesPortable humidifiersContact lens cleaning/rinsingCleaning/rinsing an open wound The risk is higher for older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Using water straight from the tap for those activities is a bad idea whether you have municipal water or get your water from a well because you could introduce a harmful pathogen into your body, says Rachel Noble, a microbiologist and professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. It’s best to use distilled water or boiled tap water for those purposes, the CDC says. What makes tap water risky in those instances? Most tap water naturally contains low levels of microorganisms such as bacteria and amoebae, says Shanna Miko, an epidemic intelligence service officer with the waterborne disease prevention branch of the CDC. The water is safe to drink because those pathogens typically get killed by stomach acid, she says. But the pathogens can multiply if they’re inhaled or introduced to more vulnerable parts of your body such as your eyes or nasal passages, potentially causing serious or deadly infections. “Those are dark, moist places that don’t have the benefit of stomach acid to help neutralize these bugs,” Miko says. Pathogens found in tap water such as ﻿Pseudomonas, nontuberculous mycobacteria and ﻿Legionella account for a significant percentage of the 120,000 hospitalizations and 7,000 deaths due to waterborne diseases annually, according to the CDC. For contact lens wearers, a dangerous amoeba called ﻿Acanthamoeba that lurks in tap water can cause a severe type of eye infection that is difficult to treat and can even lead to blindness, the CDC says. Saline solution made for contact lenses is best to use for rinsing. In addition, a small number of cases of brain-eating amoeba have been linked to nasal rinsing, neti pots or similar devices, according to the CDC. Survey: Many Americans not aware of the risk About a third of Americans don’t realize that tap water can contain bacteria or other living organisms, according to an August 2021 CDC survey conducted by Miko and her colleagues. Perhaps more concerning, many of those surveyed reported using tap water in risky ways: About 1 in 4 said they filled humidifiers or CPAP machines with tap water, 13 percent reported using tap water for nasal rinsing, and 9 percent said they use tap water for rinsing contact lenses. Adults age 55 and older were somewhat less likely to use tap water for those activities compared to younger people, the survey found. However, a significant percentage — 22 percent — still reported filling respiratory devices with tap water, potentially endangering their health. How to make tap water safe for medical uses Miko says you can either boil tap water to sterilize it or buy distilled water for those medical uses. She notes that not all bottled or filtered water is sterile. Look for “distilled” or “sterile” on the label, she says. To sterilize tap water yourself, boil the water for at least one minute (three minutes at elevations above 6,500 feet) and then let it cool before you use it. “It’s just a simple extra step,” Miko says. More advice on how to stay safe and prevent infections Use boiled water quickly. When water sits in a container for a prolonged time, any bacteria that were already in the container will start to multiply, Noble says. “Even if it’s just a few bacteria, they can grow quickly and form a biofilm,” she says. The FDA recommends storing boiled water in a clean, sealed container and using it within 24 hours. Always wash and dry your hands well. Whether you’re putting in contact lenses or filling a humidifier, if your hands aren’t clean, you could inadvertently contaminate the process, Noble says. Clean your equipment properly and frequently. It’s important to follow the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions for your specific device, Miko says. For example, most CPAP manufacturers recommend using soapy water to clean the tube, mask and humidifier reservoir every day and fully disinfecting the device at least once a week.

A big reason: Experts worry the flu season could be worse than normal this year, based on trends in the Southern Hemisphere. “We always look to the Southern Hemisphere because they have winter during our summer, and Australia had a very substantial influenza season,” says William Schaffner, M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. “There is not always a 1-to-1 correlation, but I’m concerned.” And while anyone can have a bad bout of flu, certain groups are more likely to experience dangerous complications, ranging from pneumonia and dehydration to heart failure and death. Here are seven common factors that put you at risk for a severe case of flu, and what you can do — beyond getting that all-important flu shot — to blunt, or eliminate, flu’s worst effects. ﻿1. Risk factor: You’re age 65 or older Older adults are the demographic most affected by both flu and COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 70 to 85 percent of flu-related deaths and up to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur in people 65 and older. About half of adults age 65-plus also have a second risk factor that makes them vulnerable, according to National Foundation for Infectious Diseases estimates. But even healthy older adults are at risk, because “your immune system simply is not as robust as it was when you were 25 years old,” Schaffner says. In addition, typical flu symptoms don’t always show up in older adults, causing a delay in diagnosis and treatment. “The most important symptom that may not be present in older people is fever,” Schaffner says. “People can develop a cough, feel weak, and they may even get confused, but they don’t have a fever, so family members don’t think they have the flu.” 2. Risk factor: You have heart disease or a history of stroke Researchers in recent years have uncovered a concerning link between the flu and heart complications. A CDC study published in 2020, for instance, found that 1 out of 8 older patients hospitalized with flu had a serious cardiac event (and the study looked at a big group of patients — 80,000 overall). Another study, published in 2018, found that you are six times as likely to have a heart attack during the week after being diagnosed with influenza as at other times. In both studies, a history of heart disease and stroke boosted the likelihood of a sudden heart complication. Doctors think the flu triggers an inflammatory response in your body, which in turn can create dangerous clotting in your blood vessels. “It’s like collateral damage in a war,” Schaffner says. “For up to a month after you recover from the flu, your body’s inflammatory response is still ginned up and having an effect on your body, putting you at increased risk for heart attack and stroke.” The flu vaccine is key here. In a recent study, adults over 50 who got a flu vaccine during a hospitalization had a 28 percent lower risk of a heart attack over the next year. They also had a 47 percent lower risk of a mini stroke, an 85 percent lower risk of cardiac arrest and a 73 percent lower risk of overall death. 3. Risk factor: You have diabetes Diabetes weakens your immune system, making it harder for your body to fight off disease, says Joseph Gastaldo, M.D., system medical director of infectious diseases at OhioHealth in Columbus. Influenza can also make it more difficult to control your blood sugar levels: They may rise in response to the infection, or they may fall if you don’t feel like eating while you’re sick. Meanwhile, your symptoms can make it difficult for you to recognize the signs of high or low blood sugar. “It’s very easy for diabetics [who get the flu] to become dehydrated or have issues with their kidneys,” Gastaldo says. Diabetics are three times as likely as other people to die of flu-related complications, and six times as likely to be hospitalized. The good news is, getting a flu vaccine reduces your risk of hospitalization by up to 79 percent, studies show. 4. Risk factor: You have a lung disease or asthma If you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, the flu can cause your airways to swell and become blocked with mucus, making it harder to breathe. If you have asthma, even if it’s controlled, the virus will likely inflame your airways and trigger asthma attacks. Adults with both COPD and asthma are at greater risk of developing pneumonia or another respiratory infection as a result of the flu. You can end up hospitalized or with severe and permanent damage to your lungs. Getting the flu vaccine can help. It’s associated with a 38 percent reduction in influenza-related hospitalizations among patients with COPD, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Chest. 5. Risk factor: You have a chronic condition or a weak immune system In addition to things like heart and lung disease, many other conditions increase your chance of a poor outcome from flu. Those include liver disease, kidney disease, blood disorders, metabolic disorders and neurological conditions. Some chronic conditions leave you vulnerable because they weaken your immune system or require you to take medicine that does, Gastaldo says. “A lot of older adults today take immunosuppressants for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or cirrhosis,” Gastaldo says. “And there are more people living with transplants — heart, kidney, bone marrow — who take those types of medications.” Immunocompromised patients may not get a fever with the flu, so it’s important to pay attention to even mild symptoms. They are at especially high risk for a secondary infection like pneumonia, according to the CDC. 6. Risk factor: You’ve had cancer Many cancer treatments suppress the immune system, so it may not be surprising that cancer patients are three to five times as likely to be hospitalized for influenza as the general population. But studies show you also face a greater risk if you’ve had cancer in the past, especially leukemia or lymphoma. In addition, some types of chemotherapy alter your immune system for the long term, making you more vulnerable to a severe case of the flu. If you’re undergoing cancer treatment now, the American Cancer Society recommends talking to your oncologist about the best time to get the flu shot — but do get it. In a 2019 study that analyzed data on more than 26,000 cancer patients, those who got a flu shot were significantly less likely to get the flu and to be hospitalized from the virus. 7. Risk factor: You have obesity Anyone with a body mass index (or BMI) greater than 40 is at increased risk of flu complications, according to the CDC, even adults with obesity who have no other health issues. It’s unclear exactly why obesity is a factor, Gastaldo says, but it may be because the vaccine is less effective in people with excess weight, because obesity itself impairs the immune response or because the extra weight makes it more difficult to take the deep breaths necessary to aerate your lungs. Studies show people with obesity also carry the flu virus for longer and are more likely to spread it to others. Editor’s note: This article was published on Oct. 19, 2020. It was updated in October 2022 with new information about the 2022-2023 flu season. How to protect yourself from flu if you’re at higher risk Two vaccines you need, and why this season you shouldn’t hesitate to call a doctor If you’re in a high-risk group, you can strengthen your immune system by eating healthy, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. In addition, the precautions you have practiced for two years to guard against the coronavirus — handwashing, wearing a mask and staying 6 feet away from others — will help protect you from the flu. But experts agree that the three most important steps you can take to reduce your risk from influenza are these: Get your annual flu shot. Being vaccinated is by far the most effective way to protect yourself from the flu. The vaccine is safe for nearly everyone over 6 months old, and study after study show that it significantly reduces the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalization and death. This year, the CDC says ﻿﻿older adults should specifically ask for the high-dose vaccine or one with an ingredient called an adjuvant because they help boost the immune response. And the best time to get the shot is September or October, the CDC says. Get the pneumonia vaccine. The most common complication of the flu is pneumonia, and you can help guard against it and other dangerous infections by getting the pneumonia shot. The CDC recommends that all people over 65 get the pneumonia vaccine. Contact your doctor at the first sign of symptoms. Getting in touch with your medical provider right away is especially important because COVID-19 and the flu share many of the same symptoms, so your doctor may want to test you to see which illness you have. The good news: Both diseases can be treated with antiviral medications that can keep your symptoms from progressing to a more severe state. However, these drugs are most effective if they are taken shortly after symptom onset. “We want you to have your antenna up really high for symptoms,” Gastaldo says. “If you have more trouble breathing, less energy, a low-grade fever, shortness of breath or if you’re a diabetic and your blood sugars are all of a sudden very high, don’t wait to call.” How to protect yourself from flu if you’re at higher risk Two vaccines you need, and why this season you shouldn’t hesitate to call a doctor If you’re in a high-risk group, you can strengthen your immune system by eating healthy, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/extreme-heat-stroke-heart-attack-risk/,"Extreme Heat View Series Heat Waves Can Be Hard on the Heart Soaring temperatures increase risks for heart attack and stroke By Rachel Nania, Updated June 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published July 24, 2023 / Updated June 17, 2024 Getty Images It’s not just heat stroke you have to worry about on extremely warm days. Experts say high heat can increase your risk for an actual stroke, as well as a heart attack and other cardiovascular issues. In fact, research suggests the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease (conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels) may double or triple when heat reaches extreme temperatures. A big reason: The heart has to work harder when it’s hot out, says Arash Harzand, M.D., a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Emory University. It has to pump more blood as the body works to cool itself down. (When you’re hot, the blood in your body gets routed away from the internal organs to just under the skin, where it releases heat — much like a radiator.) The body also demands more oxygen when it gets overheated, and it’s the heart’s job to deliver it. Dehydration from heat can put additional stress on the heart, since water helps the heart pump blood through the blood vessels. When you’re dehydrated, “the tank is just emptier. And so with a less full tank, your heart has to work even harder to meet all that metabolic demand,” Harzand says. Deaths from extreme heat have been increasing in the U.S. There were more than 2,300 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2023, according to federal data, up from 1,722 in 2022. Patricia Best, M.D., an interventional cardiologist and associate professor of internal medicine and cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic, estimates that at least a quarter of these deaths can be attributed to cardiovascular disease. Hot temperatures + pollution = a dangerous combination A study published in July 2023 in the journal Circulation found that the risk of a fatal heart attack among older adults in Jiangsu province, China, was 18 percent higher during two-day heat waves with heat indexes at or above the 90th percentile (ranging from 82.6°F to 97.9°F). Risks were 74 percent higher during four-day heat waves with heat indexes at or above the 97.5th percentile (ranging from 94.8°F to 109.4°F). The most dangerous days, however, were those of extreme heat and high levels of air pollution — a heart-health risk in and of itself. The researchers estimated that up to 2.8 percent of heart attack deaths may be attributed to the combination of extreme temperatures and high levels of fine particulate pollution, which comes from sources like factories, cars, trucks and wildfires. “And unfortunately, it’s becoming much more common these days when you have the confluence of wildfires and high temperatures,” says Sanjay Rajagopalan, M.D., a professor at Case Western University School of Medicine and chief of cardiovascular medicine at University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute. When it comes to stroke, studies suggest that extreme temperatures — both hot and cold — can increase risk. What’s more, research presented at the American Stroke Association’s 2020 International Stroke Conference found that spikes in temperatures may influence the severity of strokes. The researchers found that for every 9°F increase in average temperature range over three days, the severity of strokes increased by 67 percent. Risks for these heat-related cardiovascular events are not the same for everybody. Precautions are especially important for people with an underlying heart condition, high blood pressure or obesity. Individuals without access to air conditioning and shelter during high-heat days are also at greater risk, Rajagopalan says. ﻿ Heat-related cardiovascular deaths are expected to rise Cardiovascular deaths from extreme heat are projected to increase by 162 percent in the U.S. by the middle of the century, new research suggests, even if currently proposed policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are implemented. If emission-reducing efforts are ignored or are minimal, heat-related cardiovascular deaths could shoot up by 233 percent over the next several decades, a 2023 study published in Circulation found. Black adults and people 65 and older are most likely to be affected by the impact of heat on the heart, the researchers note. “The projections of this study focus on cardiovascular disease deaths, and, therefore, they represent conservative estimations of the adverse effects on cardiovascular health due to extreme heat,” American Heart Association volunteer Robert Brook, M.D., a professor of medicine and executive director of cardiovascular prevention at Wayne State University School of Medicine, said in a news release. “Nonfatal heart attacks, strokes and heart failure hospitalizations outnumber fatal events and are also highly likely to be linked with extreme heat days. The full extent of the public health threat, even just due to cardiovascular death, is likely much greater than presented in this study.” Staying safe in the heat The takeaway, Rajagopalan says, is to be aware of the risk so you can work to minimize it. “﻿Many people don’t recognize that this could be life threatening,” he says.﻿ Find a cool place to stick out the hot days — whether it’s at home or at a nearby cooling shelter. (Find them listed by state at the National Center for Health Housing.) “Being in an environment where temperatures are regulated is of the utmost importance,” Rajagopalan says. What’s more, running your air conditioning during unhealthy air quality days can help to filter out pollutants and reduce the number of harmful particles in the air you breathe. A few other tips: Time it. If you have to go out in the heat, try to go out in the early or late parts of the day when the sun isn’t as strong. And don’t be afraid to take regular breaks. Find some shade and rest for a bit. In some areas of the country, the temperatures are high even in the evening. On those days, minimize all of your time outside, Best says.

The full extent of the public health threat, even just due to cardiovascular death, is likely much greater than presented in this study.” Stay hydrated. Some people with cardiovascular conditions are used to being told to watch their fluid intake and not overdo it, Harzand says. “But hydration is important,” he adds. People with high blood pressure and heart failure who are fluid-sensitive should talk to their doctors about the best ways to stay hydrated on hot days. Dress for the heat. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing, Harzand says. And don’t forget sunglasses, a hat and sunscreen. Don’t stop taking your medications. “Don’t try and make changes to your medications because you think it’s better or safer to not take a certain medicine when you go outside,” Harzand says. If you have any concerns about your medication regimen and the heat, talk to your doctor. Be on the lookout for warning signs of heat illness. Older adults are among those at higher risk for heat-related illness. Signs of heat exhaustion include heavy sweating, cold and clammy skin and weakness, among others. Heat stroke symptoms include red, hot and dry skin (no sweating); a fast and strong pulse; confusion, dizziness and nausea; and a throbbing headache. ﻿ Editor's note: This story, originally published July 24, 2023, has been updated.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/heart-health-questions-to-ask-your-doctor/,"4 Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Your Heart Knowledge is power when it comes to lowering your risk for the nation’s no. 1 killer Eugene Mymrin/Getty Images By Sari Harrar, AARP En español Published January 17, 2023 Nearly half of Americans have at least one of the three leading risk factors for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Yet too often, key heart risks go unchecked. Roughly half of U.S. adults with high blood pressure don’t have it under control, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — many don’t even know they have it. Similarly, many adults who have high cholesterol aren’t aware, the CDC says, and about 45 percent of people who could benefit from cholesterol-lowering medications aren’t taking them. Do you know where you stand when it comes to your risk for heart disease? Here are four questions to ask your doctor. 1. How’s my blood pressure? Forty percent of Americans don’t know their blood pressure numbers, and 64 percent don’t know what those numbers mean, a 2019 survey from the American Medical Association and American Heart Association found. Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80. If that top number is 120 to 129, that’s “elevated.” If the top number is 130 or higher, or the bottom number is above 80, that’s considered “high.” Risk Factors for Heart Disease Key Risk Factors: High blood pressure High cholesterol Smoking Other risk factors include: Diabetes Obesity Physical inactivity Family history A diet high in saturated fats, trans fat, and cholesterol Drinking too much alcohol Source: CDC High blood pressure is often called a silent killer because it creeps up without symptoms. The only way to know if you have it is to get it measured. 2. What are my target cholesterol numbers, and how do I measure up? A total cholesterol level under 200 is considered normal, but the best levels of heart-threatening low-density lipo-proteins (LDLs) and triglycerides depend on your age, gender and whether you have other heart risks like diabetes. No wonder half the people with high cholesterol in a recent survey said they were confused about the best cholesterol level for them and how to get there. Similar to high blood pressure, high cholesterol can come without warning. A cholesterol test — just a quick blood draw — will check your LDL levels, your high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good,” cholesterol levels and your triglycerides, which play a role in heart attack and stroke risk. 3. Can you refer me to a dietitian? Fifty-nine percent of heart doctors say nutrition help can improve heart health as much as medications do. But in a 2021 study, 71 percent of doctors admitted they refer fewer than 10 percent of their patients to a registered dietitian. If your doctor isn’t helpful, you can search for a dietitian in your area through the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, at eatright.org. The American Heart Association recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins, including fish and legumes. 4. Is it time to see a cardiologist? Your primary care doctor will likely refer you to a cardiologist if you have serious risk factors for heart disease. But speak up and ask about one if you have a family history of heart disease or a condition called hereditary cardiac amyloidosis, where specific abnormal proteins build up in the heart and other organs, says Anekwe E. Onwuanyi, professor of medicine and chief of cardiology at Morehouse School of Medicine.﻿ Risk Factors for Heart Disease Key Risk Factors: High blood pressure High cholesterol Smoking Other risk factors include: Diabetes Obesity Physical inactivity Family history A diet high in saturated fats, trans fat, and cholesterol Drinking too much alcohol Source: CDC Sari Harrar is an award-winning reporter and contributing editor to AARP publications who writes on health, public policy and other topics.​","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 clear sentences:

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/extreme-heat-accelerates-aging/,"How Extreme Heat Can Speed Up Aging Plus, what you can do to keep cool when temps start to climb By Kristen Fischer, AARP Comments En español Published May 22, 2025 JAMIE CHUNG/TRUNK ARCHIVE Extreme heat can do more than make you sweat. According to a new study, it can make you age faster too.﻿ The study, published recently in the journal Science Advances, shows that ongoing exposure to heat over 80 degrees accelerates biological aging, which is how your body ages on the inside at the cellular level, regardless of how many birthdays you’ve had. This might mean, for example, that instead of getting a specific health condition at a certain older age, it happens earlier, says Deborah Carr, director of the Center of Innovation in Social Science at Boston University, who studies heat and aging. “[It] means you [have] more years of suffering, more years of demands on your caregiver,” Carr explains. It also means you may not have Medicare in place to properly care for any premature health problems that arise, she notes. Heat’s impact on the aging process If you’re living in an area with extreme heat for half the year, you could be even more prone to faster aging, the study found. In fact, for people living in hot climates, biological aging sped up nearly three years in some cases. For the study, a team of researchers at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California used different biological clock models to measure markers of aging in blood samples from 3,686 American adults, ages 56 and older. The researchers then compared each individual’s aging outcomes, measured by slight changes in their DNA, with their geographical heat index, considering heat and humidity. Researchers categorized hot days as those that were 80 to 90 degrees, 90 to 103 degrees, and 103 to 124 degrees. They found that people who lived in areas that experienced more days of extreme heat were more likely to see greater increases in their biological age compared with people who experienced fewer hot days. “Participants living in areas where heat days, as defined as Extreme Caution or higher levels [90 degrees and up], occur half the year, such as Phoenix, Arizona, experienced up to 14 months of additional biological aging compared to those living in areas with fewer than 10 heat days per year,” study coauthor Eunyoung Choi said in a statement. “Even after controlling for several factors, we found this association. Just because you live in an area with more heat days, you’re aging faster biologically.” How heat affects your health Biological age varies for everyone because it’s based on how your cells age. Chronological age, meanwhile, refers to how long you’ve been alive. One of the ways s﻿﻿cientists measure biological age is based on methylation — a process that changes DNA. “When you have extreme heat or when you’re exposed to it, it causes stress to your body. That stress can manifest, particularly in your cells, by changes in your DNA,” explains Arnab Ghosh, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine who studies the effects of extreme heat on older adults. It’s not just heat that can affect a person’s biological age, Ghosh says. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking or having a condition like diabetes, can change it too. Some evidence suggests that accelerated biological aging could raise the risk of dementia; it has been linked with other health issues, too, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. Heat can also raise the risk of heart attack and stroke, according to research. Ghosh notes that heat can be harder on some older individuals, including people who take certain medications or have other chronic conditions. Women may also be more susceptible to complications from heat, according to a study published in 2024, which found that women ages 40 to 64 were as vulnerable to the effects of heat as men ages 65-plus. “Whether that [heat-related stress] leads [directly] to problems or aging or advanced aging is still an open question,” Ghosh says. And researchers aren’t sure if heat stress effects are permanent, he adds. Your personal heat baseline Being in 90-plus-degree weather isn’t a standard cutoff for when heat stress begins. Everyone has a different threshold, meaning you can still experience heat stress at 80 degrees, for example. People who live in warmer climates year-round may partly adapt to the heat naturally, but it can be harder during a heat wave. If you live in Arizona, for example, you may have a different baseline than someone who lives in Montana — a phenomenon known as acclimatization, Ghosh says. Everything from your behavior and age to chronic conditions and what you wear can influence your risk for heat stress, Ghosh says, and scientists don’t know the threshold for each person. A 2021 study showed that being in 75.2 degrees continuously without proper cooling can affect your body. “That can really have a significant wear and tear on the body, especially at night,” says Carr. A certain temperature can feel different in various places — it may be cooler near a beach but feel warmer in a city with little breeze, Carr says. Knowing your threshold can get complicated if you spend part of your year in a hotter area and the rest in a cooler climate, she adds. Plus, structures in areas that are warmer year-round likely have air conditioning, but that’s not the case in cooler areas, especially where older homes are common, Carr points out. 5 ways to ward off heat’s harmful health effects You can’t stop the temps from climbing, but there are a few ways to stay safe in the heat — and perhaps ease the heat stress that could make you age faster. 1. Stay alert. Watch the news or stay up to date on advisory warnings so you can adapt what you do, how you hydrate or what you wear, Ghosh says. “As temperatures warm up, people have to be more aware of the environment around them and adjust accordingly,” Ghosh adds. The first heat wave of the season can be the worst on health, he says. 2. Avoid extreme temps. The hottest time of the day is during midday hours— a good time to stay indoors in air conditioning, especially during a heat wave, Ghosh says. If you know you don’t do well in high heat, don’t run errands at the hottest times of the day. As you get older, you may not be able to do things at midday that you could do just a few years ago, Carr explains. “People really need to be mindful about altering their behaviors [when it’s hot],” Carr adds. 3. Watch your meds. Certain medications, such as those for high blood pressure or heart disease, may raise your risk for fainting in high heat. Know if any drugs or supplements you take could make you less tolerant to the heat, Ghosh says. Keep your medications out of the heat too, Carr adds, since exposure to varying temperatures can alter them chemically. 4. Keep cool at night. Sleep in a lower temperature to avoid heat stress — especially if you already have trouble sleeping, Carr says. 5. Plan for the heat. “Have a climate plan just the way you might have a will,” Carr advises. Know where you can go if you need to leave your home or what to do if you don’t have power due to high heat. “That can be really helpful, especially for older people,” Carr says.

A recent study published in Science Advances found that prolonged exposure to extreme heat accelerates biological aging, with individuals living in areas with frequent heat days experiencing up to 14 months of additional biological aging. The research suggests that heat stress can cause cellular changes that lead to premature aging, increasing the risk of health issues like dementia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

So now is the time of year to take inventory of what’s in your medicine cabinet and stock up on the essentials to avoid any last-minute trips to the store if you get sick. One thing to keep in mind: While a number of over-the-counter remedies can bring relief from the bothersome symptoms that accompany seasonal illnesses, it’s important to touch base with your health care provider when you start to feel sick, ﻿says Paul O’Rourke, M.D., associate professor of clinical medicine at ﻿the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. If it is the flu — and a simple test at home or at the doctor’s office can tell — a prescription antiviral medication can help ease symptoms and prevent the illness from getting worse. “But it does need to be started pretty soon with the onset of symptoms,” O’Rourke says. The same goes for COVID-19 treatments, if you test positive for a coronavirus infection. ﻿Here are eight indispensable items to stock in the medicine cabinet to prepare for cold and flu season. 1. Thermometer ​﻿ First on O’Rourke’s list of cold-and-flu-season essentials is a working thermometer — whether it’s one that goes in the mouth or hovers over the forehead. “It’s important to have one around so that you can objectively assess if you do have a fever, and to provide that information to your physician if you are sick﻿, because that can help with managing your symptoms,” he adds. A temperature higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit is considered “a true fever” and warrants a call to your doctor, O’Rourke says. 2. Pulse oximeter Emergency warning signs of flu If you experience the following symptoms, seek medical care right away﻿. Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to wake up Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improve﻿s but then return﻿s or worsen﻿s Worsening of chronic medical conditions Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Another﻿ helpful tool to have on hand is a pulse oximeter, which measures blood oxygen levels. People who develop serious complications from the flu and COVID can experience difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. So if you start having breathing issues or upper respiratory symptoms, “you would be able to assess the oxygen levels in your blood and be able to report that to your physician or medical team,” O’Rourke explains. ﻿The more familiar pulse oximeters ﻿attach to a finger, but some home models are designed to be used on the ears, nose or forehead.﻿ The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has information on how to take a reading at home and interpret the results. One thing to know: Research has found that pulse oximeters may be less accurate in individuals with darker skin pigmentation. The FDA says that people with COVID who are monitoring their symptoms at home “should pay attention to all signs and symptoms of their condition and communicate any concerns to their health care provider."" Emergency warning signs of flu If you experience the following symptoms, seek medical care right away﻿. Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to wake up Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improve﻿s but then return﻿s or worsen﻿s Worsening of chronic medical conditions Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 3. A COVID-19 test The most common symptoms of cold, flu, COVID and RSV (or respiratory syncytial virus) overlap, making it difficult to pin down a diagnosis. That’s why having a rapid at-home ﻿COVID test stashed away can be especially helpful﻿. You can find these over-the-counter tests at pharmacies around the country, and all U.S. households can order four for free at covidtest.gov. Knowing whether you’re positive for COVID can impact the treatment course of your illness — especially if you are at higher risk ﻿for a more severe case, explains Robert Weber, administrator for pharmacy services at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and assistant dean for medical center ﻿affairs at the Ohio State University College of Pharmacy. If you are 50 and older or have certain health conditions and test positive for COVID, your doctor may recommend a prescription antiviral pill to help ease the severity of your symptoms. The results will also tell you whether you need to isolate from others so that you don’t pass on ﻿the virus. Newer to retail pharmacy shelves are combination COVID and flu at-home tests. These work just like the at-home COVID tests, where you swab your nose and in “usually 15 to 30 minutes, it will give you a line that tells you whether you have COVID or whether you have influenza A or influenza B,” says Greg Martin, M.D., professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine. 4. Pain relievers ﻿Cold﻿s, the flu and other seasonal illnesses can come with headaches and muscle aches, which in many cases over-the-counter pain relievers can help alleviate.﻿ They also have the added benefit of temporarily reducing fevers. Acetaminophen (Tylenol is the brand name) is generally recommended for older adults, since nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — which include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) — can raise bleeding risks in the gastrointestinal tract, a risk that increases with age. NSAIDs can also damage the kidneys and ﻿raise blood pressure, especially if used consistently, says Ashley Garling, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s College of Pharmacy. “If you have any ulcers or history of ulcers or are on blood thinners, then I would avoid them,” Garling adds. However, it’s important to talk to ﻿your doctor about the best option for you, since acetaminophen is not risk-free — especially for people with liver issues. What’s more, acetaminophen tends to hide in several combination medicines that are sold to treat cold and flu symptoms, like NyQuil and DayQuil, so be sure to read the label to avoid unintentionally double﻿ dosing. Taking too much can cause serious liver damage. “[It’s important to] make sure that you’re taking a minimum number of over-the-counter medicines that help with your symptoms, and definitely reporting to your physician or medical team what over-the-counter medicines you’re taking, so they can provide you advice and address with you if they have any concerns that maybe you’re taking too much of one thing,” O’Rourke says. 5. Sore throat soothers Cough drops can settle a sore throat or nagging cough, so having a bag or two on hand isn’t a bad idea. That said, you don’t want to overdo it on the lozenges, especially if you are diabetic, since most contain sugar, Garling notes. (There are plenty of sugar-free options out there if you are watching your sugar intake.) Taking too many can also lead to a stomachache, “but generally they’re pretty safe and they can be very soothing,” she adds. Also﻿, ﻿be cautious about using anything that numbs the back of the throat, which can make it difficult to swallow, Weber says. And don’t forget about some of the more obvious remedies: ﻿A cup of hot tea or a glass of ice-cold water can bring relief to an irritated throat. 6. Cough calmers Here’s another area where you have to pay attention, since many cough medicines contain more than one ingredient — including some that older adults should avoid, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), which can have a sedating effect and increase ﻿the risk ﻿of falls. Diphenhydramine has also been linked in studies to increased dementia risks. Another thing to be on the lookout for: packages with ﻿“DM﻿” on the label, which stands for dextromethorphan, which can change your blood pressure and suppress your respiratory system, Garling says. “Really using only one ingredient for the one thing that’s bothering you the most is typically our recommendation,” she adds. Weber suggests guaifenesin (Mucinex) to ﻿help thin and clear mucus-causing coughs. Be sure to drink plenty of water while taking it to help the process along, he says. Some antihistamines﻿, like cetirizine (Zyrtec) and loratadine (Claritin)﻿, can also help calm a dry, hacking cough from postnasal drip and are safer than other options, Garling adds. Don’t forget about honey: Research published in the medical journal BMJ shows that honey is an effective way to tame a cough. 7. Nasal sprays A saline nasal spray can help relieve nasal congestion brought on by a cold. If you’re considering another over-the-counter nasal spray, Weber ﻿recommends check﻿ing with the pharmacist first to make sure it won’t affect your blood pressure or worsen any other health conditions. 8. Humidifier Another cold﻿ weather must: a ﻿mini humidifier, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says can ease a sore throat and cough brought on by common cold viruses. Steaming up the bathroom with a hot shower will also do the trick in a pinch. ﻿ Do﻿’s and don’ts for cold and flu season Do clean out your medicine cabinet and get rid of any old or unused drugs. Check expiration dates — anything that’s beyond﻿ its date can lose effectiveness, according to the FDA﻿. “If there are things that are expired, get rid of those medicines and replace them with new medicines that will be more effective and safe,” O’Rourke says. Don’t reach for an old prescription to treat a new illness. Taking antibiotics when you don’t need them, for example, can contribute to antibiotic resistance and cause a number of side effects. Pain medications like Percocet contain acetaminophen, and if you’re taking that already as a fever reducer or pain reliever, you could be getting too much. “It’s just really a good idea not to take any prescription medicine unless you talk to your doctor,” Weber says. Do make sure you stay on top of refills for your other prescription medications so you don’t have to venture out and refill routine medicines when you are ill. “It’s always appropriate to ensure that you have an adequate supply of the prescription medications for your chronic conditions﻿, because I wouldn’t want you feeling even worse if there’s a medicine that you need and you’ve run out of﻿ it and you’re feeling too ill to go out and get it,” O’Rourke says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/does-sugar-cause-cancer/#comments_widget_id,"Is There a Link Between Sugar and Cancer? Eating too much added sugar can increase your risk for numerous health problems By Jessica Migala, AARP Comments En español Published May 08, 2025 Chris Gash There’s some not-so-sweet news when it comes to sugar: Eat too much of the stuff and it can wreak havoc on your health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), consuming too many added sugars — which you’ll find in many packaged and processed foods and drinks — can lead to obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. But what about cancer? Here’s what researchers know so far about sugar and cancer risk. Older adults are overconsuming sugar First, it’s important to know how much sugar is too much. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends consuming no more than 10 percent of your daily calories from added sugars. If you’re eating 2,000 calories a day, that’s 200 calories, or 50 grams of added sugar. But many adults are not following this advice. 5 top sources of added sugars The top sources of added sugar, according to the CDC, include: Sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks) Desserts and sweet snacks Sweetened tea and coffee Candy Breakfast cereals and bars Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention According to a study published in 2023, nearly 30 percent of U.S. adults ages 51 to 70 were considered to be high consumers of added sugars, meaning they consumed 1.5 times the national recommendation. Twenty-two percent of people older than 70 were in this category. Note that added sugar is not the same as sugar that occurs naturally in fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains. “Sugar is in most of the food we eat,” says oncology dietitian Renee Stubbins, assistant professor of nutritional sciences in medicine at Houston Methodist. It provides energy that our cells need to survive. The difference is that foods that contain natural sugar, like strawberries and broccoli, also tend to have other essential nutrients, like fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. “These are cancer-fighting foods,” Stubbins says. Cookies and cupcakes, on the other hand, don’t come with any added nutritional benefits. 5 top sources of added sugars The top sources of added sugar, according to the CDC, include: Sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks) Desserts and sweet snacks Sweetened tea and coffee Candy Breakfast cereals and bars Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Does added sugar cause cancer? The answer isn’t completely straightforward. Natalie Ledesma, an oncology dietitian with UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Francisco, says we lack studies that identify sugar as a direct cause of cancer. “However, there are trials that show a higher consumption of added sugar is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers,” she says. For example, in a study analyzing the dietary records of more than 101,000 adults, consuming sugary drinks was associated with an 18 percent higher risk of overall cancer and a 22 percent higher risk for breast cancer. That research was published in the medical journal BMJ. And a review in Cancer Treatment and Research Communications concluded that high sugar intake may elevate cancer risk through insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, both of which can be drivers of cancer. Sugar can also lead to weight gain, and the CDC says being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk for 13 types of cancer. “We definitely know that metabolic dysfunction, which can be driven by having higher blood sugar levels and obesity, increases the risk for developing several different cancer types,” Ledesma says. In a PLOS One study, metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions including abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, high blood triglycerides and low “good” HDL cholesterol — was associated with an increased risk of 11 cancers, including: ColorectalLiverPancreaticPostmenopausal breastEndometrialBladderKidneyNon-Hodgkin’s lymphomaLeukemiaLungThyroid Researchers point to inflammation as one possible explanation. Having more adiposity — or body fat, especially abdominal fat — creates more of an inflammatory state, explains Stubbins, and chronic inflammation can contribute to the development of cancer. Keep in mind that you can have metabolic dysfunction even if you’re at a healthy weight. “Some people can eat whatever they want and never gain a pound, but that doesn’t mean that they’re healthy,” says Kim Geiringer, an oncology dietitian at the Maroone Cancer Center at Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital in Weston, Florida. “They can have high levels of fat cells in their body, or high cholesterol or triglycerides. They may even have prediabetes or [be] eking towards it, which also puts you at a higher risk of cancer.” This means that no matter your weight, it’s important to know your metabolic health numbers (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar) and consume a balanced diet, which includes moderating your sugar intake. What if you already have cancer? The idea that sugar “feeds” existing cancer cells is a common refrain, giving way to the notion that you can starve cancer cells if you don’t give them sugar. But there’s a lot of nuance to this, Geiringer says. As the fuel for every cell in our body, glucose (sugar) does feed cancer cells. But our bodies run on glucose, and “unfortunately, you can’t give glucose to healthy cells and not cancer cells,” Geiringer says. “You can’t starve cancer. In fact, when you have cancer, you have increased nutritional needs. You need more calories and protein, so cutting out any food can lead to weight loss and malnutrition, which leads to poor outcomes in cancer,” Geiringer says. One reason: The body requires more nutrients to heal, cope with side effects and keep up energy after what can be very taxing treatments. In this instance, a dietitian may recommend drinking a milkshake, if that’s what you can stomach, because the sugar risk pales in comparison with the risk of not meeting your calorie needs. Of course, this is based on you as an individual, but it also helps to know that sugar intake was not found to be associated with cancer mortality, according to research published in Nutrition. Striking the right balance with sugar All this is not to say you can’t indulge in sweets that can spark a smile or turn a get-together into a celebration. But there has to be a balance, Stubbins says. “It’s important to have functional sugar — found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables — most of the time and occasionally eat the treats,” she adds. For cancer prevention and overall health, the World Cancer Research Fund says that 40 percent of cancers can be prevented with healthy lifestyle habits. While cutting back on added sugar is one step, it’s not the only one. A cancer-preventive lifestyle includes limiting alcohol, exercising, limiting fast foods, and eating more whole grains, vegetables, fruit and beans. What about artificial sweeteners? Some people turn to artificial sugars to get that sweet taste without calories, but there has been concern that they can cause cancer, too. However, according to groups like the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, nonnutritive sweeteners, or sugar substitutes, have not been found to cause cancer in the amounts we typically consume, though research is ongoing. Still, these are often found in ultra-processed foods, which registered dietitians generally advise limiting as well. Still, there is only so much that’s under your control when it comes to your future health. “Having a healthier diet means there is less of a chance to develop cancer cells,” Geiringer says. “But unfortunately, if you have a genetic predisposition to cancer, diet can help but it may not be completely preventative.” What about artificial sweeteners? Some people turn to artificial sugars to get that sweet taste without calories, but there has been concern that they can cause cancer, too. However, according to groups like the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, nonnutritive sweeteners, or sugar substitutes, have not been found to cause cancer in the amounts we typically consume, though research is ongoing. Still, these are often found in ultra-processed foods, which registered dietitians generally advise limiting as well. Jessica Migala has written for Marie Claire, Prevention and more than 30 other publications.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

The article explores the relationship between sugar consumption and cancer risk, examining whether a diet high in added sugars can increase the likelihood of developing cancer.

Notably, experts emphasize that a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, including limiting added sugars, exercising, and eating whole foods, can help prevent cancer.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/causes-of-inflammation/,"7 Inflammation Triggers It’s helpful when you get a cut, but if left unchecked, inflammation can be bad for your health By Jeanette Beebe, AARP Comments En español Published February 23, 2024 Simone Noronha Chances are you’ve scraped your knee, bumped a body part or received a vaccine and felt some pain, swelling and maybe even a little heat in the area where it occurred. These symptoms are a result of inflammation, which is the body’s reaction to an injury or a foreign invader. Despite the unpleasant side effects, this short-term response is healthy; it’s part of the body’s healing process. But when inflammation lingers and simmers in the absence of invaders or injuries, it can hold the body hostage and fuel a host of health issues. What’s known as chronic inflammation has been linked to several diseases, including cancer, heart disease, lung disease, gastrointestinal disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease. Unlike with acute inflammation, you may be totally unaware of chronic inflammation; its symptoms can be subtler or easy to blame on other ailments. Fatigue, weight gain, gastrointestinal problems, mouth sores, joint pain, anxiety and depression can all be warning signs of chronic inflammation. So can skin rashes, acid reflux and frequent infections. The good news: There are some things you can do and a few triggers you can avoid to help lower your risk for chronic inflammation. Here are seven inflammation triggers. 1. Smoking ""Smoking is the biggest risk factor for inflammation,"" says Saraswathi Lakkasani, M.D., a gastroenterologist in Richmond, Virginia, who sees a lot of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel disease and colon cancer, all of which have ties to chronic inflammation. Studies have shown smoking activates certain white blood cells that can increase inflammation, and it boosts the amount of pro-inflammatory bacteria in the gut. In the lungs, smoking damages the cells that line and protect the airway, leaving an individual more vulnerable to infections. “So it’s very hard for the body to continue its healing process if the patient is smoking,” Lakkas﻿ani says. If you smoke and want to quit, talk to your doctor. There are prescription and over-the-counter medications that may be able to help, as well as free resources and programs. 2. Pollution Research has linked pollutants that circulate in our outdoor air — like fine particulate matter — with increased inflammation. These irritants can cause both short-term inflammation and, if exposure is continuous over time, chronic inflammation. Take, for example, silica dust — found in materials like sand, stone and concrete. More than 2 million people are exposed to this irritant at work, and when inhaled over a long period of time, it has been linked to chronic inflammation. It’s not just outdoor air that poses a threat. Inside, fireplaces, wood-burning stoves and gas ranges can worsen air quality, says Courtney Blair, M.D., an allergist and immunologist in McLean, Virginia. The American Lung Association recommends checking air quality reports for your area daily, and if pollution levels are high, limiting your time outside. If you have to go out, an N95 mask can help filter out some harmful particles. 3. Chronic stress “Stress has its own effect on inflammation. It never lets the body heal,” Lakkasani says. Its impact on the body happens by way of hormones when there’s too much cortisol in your blood for too long. While a little bit of cortisol, a steroid hormone, can actually help your immune system in the short term, too much cortisol over time can be damaging, boosting inflammation and weakening the immune system. So what can you do? “If people have trouble managing stress, I’d suggest seeking help to learn to manage the body’s response to difficult situations,” Blair says. “Do things that bring joy, try new things, keep learning, stay engaged with other people, stay on top of routine preventative care with a primary care provider.” Studies have shown that exercise can help bring down levels of cortisol — especially in older adults. Spending time outside and in nature can also have a positive effect on cortisol levels, according to research. Symptoms of Inflammation Acute inflammation: Flushed skin at the site of an injury Pain or tenderness Swelling Heat Chronic inflammation: Abdominal pain Chest pain Fatigue Insomnia Fever Mouth sores Joint pain or stiffness Skin rash Depression or anxiety Diarrhea Constipation Acid reflux Weight gain or loss Frequent infections Source: Cleveland Clinic 4. Poor sleep Research has linked sleep deprivation to inflammation, which, according to Harvard Health Publishing, may help to explain why poor sleep is a risk factor for several chronic diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. “Sleep is where the immune system and the whole body reconstitutes and heals,” Blair says. A study from researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai found that skimping on sleep can alter the programming and production of immune cells, increasing inflammation. “This is important because it is yet another key observation that sleep reduces inflammation and, conversely, that sleep interruption increases inflammation,” lead author Filip Swirski, director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at Icahn Mount Sinai, said in a news release. “This work emphasizes the importance of adults consistently sleeping seven to eight hours a day to help prevent inflammation and disease, especially for those with underlying medical conditions.” Research suggests that sleep also helps to clear pro-inflammatory toxins from the brain, including beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease. There’s a lot you can do to get a better night’s sleep, like exercising during the day, avoiding electronic devices before you turn in and keeping a regular bedtime. If you’re still having trouble catching z’s, you may want to talk to your doctor about cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is the first-line treatment for insomnia. Symptoms of Inflammation Acute inflammation: Flushed skin at the site of an injury Pain or tenderness Swelling Heat Chronic inflammation: Abdominal pain Chest pain Fatigue Insomnia Fever Mouth sores Joint pain or stiffness Skin rash Depression or anxiety Diarrhea Constipation Acid reflux Weight gain or loss Frequent infections Source: Cleveland Clinic 5. Excessive alcohol Though alcohol’s impact on the immune system is complex, over time, consistently drinking too much alcohol does appear to cause systemic inflammation, as well as organ damage. This happens when alcohol leaves various harmful byproducts in the body, including cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species, which the immune system attempts to clean up, resulting in a cascade of inflammation. Overdoing it with alcohol can have a “high impact on the liver,” Lakkasani says. This matters for inflammation because the liver detoxifies what we eat, she explains. If you damage your liver by drinking alcohol in excess, the work it’s able to do will be limited, which will allow inflammation to spread. Another effect is what alcohol does to the gut: it disrupts the community of microbes that live there, and an imbalance of “good” and “bad” gut bacteria has been linked to inflammation. There are several things you can do to lower your alcohol intake. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends tracking your drinks and identifying and managing your triggers — those things that make you want to drink — if you are looking to cut back. 6. Obesity Obesity is a known driver of chronic inflammation. When more calories than the body needs are consumed, they are stored in the form of adipose tissue, or body fat, and this tissue creates and releases chemicals that can promote inflammation. ""What is especially problematic is central obesity,"" Blair says, referring to abdominal, or belly fat. “We know that folks who have a larger-than-healthy middle have higher rates of poor health outcomes. ” Fat that lurks below the surface in the abdomen and surrounds the organs, called visceral fat, can produce hormones and toxins that cause chronic inflammation. Obesity is also associated with less robust immune system responses to infections and vaccinations, Blair says, and excess weight can increase a person’s risk for complications from infections. “For my asthma and allergy patients, [obesity] can lead to more frequent and more severe exacerbations, and [it’s] more difficult to control disease,” Blair says. 7. Ultra-processed foods At least 60 percent of calories in the American diet comes from ultra-processed foods — and that’s bad news if you’re trying to manage inflammation. “The more [refined] carbohydrates you eat, the more your body will favor the inflammation,” Lakkasani says. That’s because refined carbohydrates — your sugary cereals, white rice, French fries and store-bought bread — hit the bloodstream quickly and cause blood sugar to spike. According to the Cleveland Clinic, a surge in blood sugar triggers an inflammatory response as the body tries to remove the sugar from the blood. Other inflammatory foods include those that contain trans fats and hydrogenated oils (store-bought cookies and pastries), as well as processed meats (hot dogs and bacon), red meat, mayonnaise, sugary drinks and fast foods. Lakkasani recommends her patients eat an anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet, full of fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, like nuts. Jeanette Beebe is a journalist whose work has appeared in Time, Popular Science, Scientific American and elsewhere. She lives in Akron, Ohio. She attended the 2024 conference with the support of a journalism fellowship from the Gerontological Society of America, the Journalists Network on Generations and the Silver Century Foundation.","The article explores the causes and consequences of chronic inflammation, a condition that can lead to various health issues, including cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The key findings highlight seven triggers of inflammation: smoking, pollution, chronic stress, poor sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and ultra-processed foods. A novel insight is that simple lifestyle changes, such as adopting an anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet, exercising regularly, and managing stress, can help mitigate chronic inflammation and reduce the risk of related diseases.",88

Eating too much added sugar can increase your risk for numerous health problems By Jessica Migala, AARP Comments En español Published May 08, 2025 Chris Gash There’s some not-so-sweet news when it comes to sugar: Eat too much of the stuff and it can wreak havoc on your health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), consuming too many added sugars — which you’ll find in many packaged and processed foods and drinks — can lead to obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. But what about cancer? Here’s what researchers know so far about sugar and cancer risk. Older adults are overconsuming sugar First, it’s important to know how much sugar is too much. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends consuming no more than 10 percent of your daily calories from added sugars. If you’re eating 2,000 calories a day, that’s 200 calories, or 50 grams of added sugar. But many adults are not following this advice. 5 top sources of added sugars The top sources of added sugar, according to the CDC, include: Sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks) Desserts and sweet snacks Sweetened tea and coffee Candy Breakfast cereals and bars Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention According to a study published in 2023, nearly 30 percent of U.S. adults ages 51 to 70 were considered to be high consumers of added sugars, meaning they consumed 1.5 times the national recommendation. Twenty-two percent of people older than 70 were in this category. Note that added sugar is not the same as sugar that occurs naturally in fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains. “Sugar is in most of the food we eat,” says oncology dietitian Renee Stubbins, assistant professor of nutritional sciences in medicine at Houston Methodist. It provides energy that our cells need to survive. The difference is that foods that contain natural sugar, like strawberries and broccoli, also tend to have other essential nutrients, like fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. “These are cancer-fighting foods,” Stubbins says. Cookies and cupcakes, on the other hand, don’t come with any added nutritional benefits. 5 top sources of added sugars The top sources of added sugar, according to the CDC, include: Sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks) Desserts and sweet snacks Sweetened tea and coffee Candy Breakfast cereals and bars Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Does added sugar cause cancer? The answer isn’t completely straightforward. Natalie Ledesma, an oncology dietitian with UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Francisco, says we lack studies that identify sugar as a direct cause of cancer. “However, there are trials that show a higher consumption of added sugar is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers,” she says. For example, in a study analyzing the dietary records of more than 101,000 adults, consuming sugary drinks was associated with an 18 percent higher risk of overall cancer and a 22 percent higher risk for breast cancer. That research was published in the medical journal BMJ. And a review in Cancer Treatment and Research Communications concluded that high sugar intake may elevate cancer risk through insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, both of which can be drivers of cancer. Sugar can also lead to weight gain, and the CDC says being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk for 13 types of cancer. “We definitely know that metabolic dysfunction, which can be driven by having higher blood sugar levels and obesity, increases the risk for developing several different cancer types,” Ledesma says. In a PLOS One study, metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions including abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, high blood triglycerides and low “good” HDL cholesterol — was associated with an increased risk of 11 cancers, including: ColorectalLiverPancreaticPostmenopausal breastEndometrialBladderKidneyNon-Hodgkin’s lymphomaLeukemiaLungThyroid Researchers point to inflammation as one possible explanation. Having more adiposity — or body fat, especially abdominal fat — creates more of an inflammatory state, explains Stubbins, and chronic inflammation can contribute to the development of cancer. Keep in mind that you can have metabolic dysfunction even if you’re at a healthy weight. “Some people can eat whatever they want and never gain a pound, but that doesn’t mean that they’re healthy,” says Kim Geiringer, an oncology dietitian at the Maroone Cancer Center at Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital in Weston, Florida. “They can have high levels of fat cells in their body, or high cholesterol or triglycerides. They may even have prediabetes or [be] eking towards it, which also puts you at a higher risk of cancer.” This means that no matter your weight, it’s important to know your metabolic health numbers (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar) and consume a balanced diet, which includes moderating your sugar intake. What if you already have cancer? The idea that sugar “feeds” existing cancer cells is a common refrain, giving way to the notion that you can starve cancer cells if you don’t give them sugar. But there’s a lot of nuance to this, Geiringer says. As the fuel for every cell in our body, glucose (sugar) does feed cancer cells. But our bodies run on glucose, and “unfortunately, you can’t give glucose to healthy cells and not cancer cells,” Geiringer says. “You can’t starve cancer. In fact, when you have cancer, you have increased nutritional needs. You need more calories and protein, so cutting out any food can lead to weight loss and malnutrition, which leads to poor outcomes in cancer,” Geiringer says. One reason: The body requires more nutrients to heal, cope with side effects and keep up energy after what can be very taxing treatments. In this instance, a dietitian may recommend drinking a milkshake, if that’s what you can stomach, because the sugar risk pales in comparison with the risk of not meeting your calorie needs. Of course, this is based on you as an individual, but it also helps to know that sugar intake was not found to be associated with cancer mortality, according to research published in Nutrition. Striking the right balance with sugar All this is not to say you can’t indulge in sweets that can spark a smile or turn a get-together into a celebration. But there has to be a balance, Stubbins says. “It’s important to have functional sugar — found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables — most of the time and occasionally eat the treats,” she adds. For cancer prevention and overall health, the World Cancer Research Fund says that 40 percent of cancers can be prevented with healthy lifestyle habits. While cutting back on added sugar is one step, it’s not the only one. A cancer-preventive lifestyle includes limiting alcohol, exercising, limiting fast foods, and eating more whole grains, vegetables, fruit and beans. What about artificial sweeteners? Some people turn to artificial sugars to get that sweet taste without calories, but there has been concern that they can cause cancer, too. However, according to groups like the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, nonnutritive sweeteners, or sugar substitutes, have not been found to cause cancer in the amounts we typically consume, though research is ongoing. Still, these are often found in ultra-processed foods, which registered dietitians generally advise limiting as well. Still, there is only so much that’s under your control when it comes to your future health. “Having a healthier diet means there is less of a chance to develop cancer cells,” Geiringer says. “But unfortunately, if you have a genetic predisposition to cancer, diet can help but it may not be completely preventative.” What about artificial sweeteners? Some people turn to artificial sugars to get that sweet taste without calories, but there has been concern that they can cause cancer, too. However, according to groups like the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, nonnutritive sweeteners, or sugar substitutes, have not been found to cause cancer in the amounts we typically consume, though research is ongoing.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/natural-blood-pressure-remedies/,"View Series 10 Surprising Ways to Lower Your Blood Pressure Without Medication Try these tactics to help fight hypertension and bring your numbers down By Beth Howard and Lauren Evoy Davis, Updated April 09, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 03, 2022 / Updated April 09, 2025 Getty Images High Blood Pressure Treatments High blood pressure stages and types Hypertension causes and symptoms High blood pressure treatment, management and prevention Breathing exercises to lower blood pressure Blood pressure medication side effects Tart cherry juice and hypertension Before David Hampshere started taking medication for high blood pressure, his numbers soared to an unhealthy 150/100 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). For comparison, a normal blood pressure should clock in below 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association. But when Hampshere, a Florida-based real estate investor, lost 80 pounds over a period of nine months, his blood pressure dipped down to normal. With the extra weight gone — and a daily game of pickleball to keep it off — Hampshere’s doctor let him experiment with going off his blood pressure medication. And by Hampshere’s next exam, his doctor agreed the medicine wasn't needed anymore. More than 100 million Americans — or nearly half of U.S. adults — have high blood pressure (also called hypertension), which is a leading risk factor for heart disease. Although many are on medication to lower their blood pressure, some 30 million Americans out of that grand total have what’s known as stage 1 hypertension, for which blood pressure–lowering medication is not always recommended. (Stage 1 is when the systolic, or upper, number on a blood pressure reading is between 130 and 139 mm Hg and the diastolic, or bottom, number is between 80 and 89 mm Hg.) If left untreated, hypertension can lead to heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and kidney disease, particularly among men and people of color, says Kendra Sims, an epidemiologist at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine. Lifestyle tweaks such as losing weight, reducing salt intake, exercising, limiting alcohol and lowering stress are all effective ways to wrangle hypertension, research shows. Here are a few more unexpected strategies, though it’s important to note that if you’re on blood pressure medication, you should never stop taking it without consulting your doctor. 1. Train your breathing muscles High-intensity breathing using a device that creates resistance when you inhale led to lower blood pressure readings over time, according to a 2022 study from the University of Colorado in Boulder. “We found that 30 resisted inhales per day, five to seven days a week for six weeks, lowered systolic blood pressure by 9 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 4 mm Hg,” explained study coauthor Daniel Craighead, an assistant research professor in the university’s Integrative Physiology of Aging Laboratory. The effect is comparable to that of aerobic exercise, such as walking or running — though you’ll want to continue your regular workouts for other health benefits. And this breath training can lower blood pressure as effectively as hypertension medications, researchers have noted. “If that’s maintained over the long term, that’s enough to decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease by 25 percent,” Craighead says. High-intensity breathing seems to work by promoting the production of nitric oxide, a heart-helpful compound in the cells that line blood vessel walls, Craighead says. Regular breathing workouts help to expand blood vessels, improving blood flow. Participants in the study used a device called PowerBreathe. There are similar devices on the market to get your diaphragm and other breathing muscles in better shape — and to possibly lower your blood pressure.

Take up tai chi Recent Chinese research suggests this gentle exercise, which involves slow, flowing motions and deep breathing, can improve hypertension. The study of 208 people with somewhat elevated blood pressure found that those who practiced tai chi for three months significantly decreased their blood pressure, compared with those who didn’t. Another study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, suggests that tai chi may even have a leg up on aerobic exercise for people at risk for hypertension. The 173 adult participants with prehypertension who were randomly assigned to the tai chi group saw greater reductions in their blood pressure than the 169 adults who engaged in aerobic exercise, according to the 2024 study. Mohanakrishnan Sathyamoorthy, M.D., a board-certified cardiologist and chair of internal medicine at Burnett School of Medicine at Texas Christian University, says there’s “a great bit of evidence” on the blood-pressure benefits of exercise routines that incorporate mindfulness, such as tai chi. Which brings us to our third tip … 3. Try mindfulness Researchers have found that mindfulness might be an effective strategy for lowering blood pressure. A study published in 2023 in the journal Hypertension found that adults who participated in a customized mindfulness program that promoted self-awareness, attention control and emotional regulation had significantly lower systolic blood pressure numbers six months later, compared with adults who did not complete the mindfulness program. The randomized controlled trial included more than 200 adults with elevated blood pressure from the Providence, Rhode Island, area. The average age of the participants was 59. After an eight-week program that taught participants how to apply mindfulness skills to their eating habits, exercise habits, alcohol use and stress-coping skills, the researchers found that participants in the mindfulness program slashed their systolic blood pressure by 5.9 mm Hg, on average, compared with a 1.4 mm Hg reduction among participants in the control group. The researchers found that participants in the mindfulness group also reduced their sedentary time by an average of 351 minutes weekly. 4. Just stretch When researchers at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada studied the effect of walking on older adults with hypertension, they found that a control group of people assigned to do simple stretching exercises actually had lower blood pressure readings than those who walked. “We stumbled into this by accident,” says study author Philip Chilibeck, professor of kinesiology at the University of Saskatchewan. That finding led to a formal study comparing the two activities. The result: Five days a week of stretching for 30 minutes led to greater improvements in blood pressure than five days of 30-minute walks. Stretching seems to literally stretch a person’s blood vessels, which reduces arterial stiffness, lowering blood pressure, Chilibeck says. He recommends gently stretching the big muscles in the lower body as follows: To stretch your hamstring muscles (back of the legs), place your foot on a low stool or step and lean forward until you feel the stretch in the back of your leg. To stretch your quadriceps (front of the thighs), lie on your side with your knee bent behind you. Grab your foot and pull it back toward your butt, feeling the stretch in your front thigh. Stretch the calves by placing your foot against a wall and leaning forward until you feel the stretch in the back of the lower leg. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds, then take a break, Chilibeck advises. Repeat the stretch three or four times with both legs. “This is especially useful for people who tend not to be very active,” Chilibeck says. “And it will improve the flexibility of your joints to boot.” 5. Work wall sits into your workout A review of 270 studies, published in 2023 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM), found that isometric exercises — and wall sits in particular — are effective in lowering blood pressure. In fact, researchers found that these types of exercises — where you hold your body in one position, like a wall sit or a plank — are almost twice as effective at lowering blood pressure compared with just doing cardio-intensive activities, like running and biking. “It’s the most effective form of exercise if your goal is to lower blood pressure,” says Victoria Maizes, M.D., a professor of medicine, family medicine and public health at the University of Arizona. Personal trainer April Hattori says wall sits are better for your joints than squats, and she demonstrates how to do them in this AARP video. Ready to give it a try? Experts recommend holding the position for 20 or 30 seconds when starting out, though you should talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise program. You can build up to more time as your body gets used to the exercise. Aim for three sessions of isometric exercises each week. 6. Listen to some calming tunes What you listen to can affect your blood pressure, and if you’re looking to lower your numbers, research suggests that something with a slow tempo is key. A 2022 article published in the journal Cureus found that music with a slower tempo helped slow the heart rate of study participants; fast music sped it up. The slow music also helped lower participants’ blood pressure, whereas the fast music caused it to rise. Janish Kothari, M.D., a cardiologist in Jersey City, New Jersey, explains that music helps “by countering the mechanisms of the sympathetic nervous system, slowing your heart rate, releasing endorphins, [and] creating a stimulation of the vagus nerve, which causes dilation of those blood vessels — and all that will lower the blood pressure.” 7. Cut down on plastic packaging Ready-to-eat meals are convenient when you’re in a hurry, but research suggests their packaging may not be the best for your blood pressure. Bisphenol A (BPA) or BPA replacements that make plastic bendable can leach into food when heated in the microwave, and a 2024 study in the journal Nutrients found an association between increased BPA concentrations in the urine of people who ate ready-to-eat meals and an increase in blood pressure. BPA can also be found in the lining of soda cans, though some manufacturers are phasing the chemical out. An older study published in the journal Hypertension compared the blood pressure of people who drank out of cans to those who drank out of glass bottles and found that people who drank from cans had higher levels of BPA in their urine and also higher blood pressure readings than those who drank from glass bottles. The authors note that their findings add to previous research that reached similar conclusions. “It's sort of one of these invisible things that we don't necessarily pay that much attention to,” the University of Arizona’s Maizes says. 8. Go ahead and eat that piece of dark chocolate Candy doesn’t typically make lists for its health benefits, but dark chocolate can be an exception. One reason is that it has heart-protective properties and can lower your blood pressure, according to 2024 research published in the journal Nutrients. Dark chocolate activates nitric oxide, which relaxes and widens the blood vessels and improves blood flow. “It (the nitric oxide) reduces inflammation, and it helps lower blood pressure because it reduces arterial stiffness,” Maizes says. This stiffness, which occurs with age, hampers the heart to expand and contract as it should, according to a 2023 article in the journal Clinical Hypertension. 9. Take at least 8,200 steps a day You may have heard that you need to get in 10,000 steps a day for good health, but it looks like 8,200 may be the magic number if you’re hoping to keep your blood pressure in check, according to a 2022 study from researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, published in the journal Nature. The study, which included more than 6,000 people with a median age of 57, used electronic health records and data from their Fitbit devices to reach this conclusion. Study participants who achieved 8,200 daily steps had lower rates of high blood pressure and other health conditions, including obesity and diabetes. Can’t get 8,200 steps in? Though it may not make a significant dent in your blood pressure numbers, taking just 2,337 steps can lower your odds of dying from cardiovascular disease, according to research published in 2023 in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology. 10. Adopt the “blood pressure diet” Looking for a reliable way to lower high blood pressure? Try the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which ranks at the top of the American Heart Association’s list of best heart-healthy diets. Researchers from UCSF analyzed the effects of various lifestyle approaches to lowering hypertension, and they estimated that widespread adoption of the DASH diet — which emphasizes fruits and vegetables, lean protein and low sodium — could prevent 26,000 heart-related events and nearly 3,000 deaths. The researchers only focused on people with stage 1 hypertension, notes Sims, the UCSF epidemiologist and a coauthor on the study, published in the journal Hypertension. “The benefits are probably bigger because if we all followed the diet, we would stop people from even being in the higher-risk groups,” she adds. Similar to the Mediterranean diet, the DASH eating plan calls for: 6 to 8 servings of grains a day4 to 5 servings of fruit a day4 to 5 servings of vegetables a day6 or fewer 1-ounce servings of lean meat, poultry or fish a day2 to 3 servings of low-fat dairy a day4 to 5 weekly servings of nuts, beans or seedsSparing amounts of salt, sugar and fat And while it may take time to get used to all the extra fiber, the results speak for themselves.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/covid-2024-predictions/,"4 Big COVID Predictions for 2024 As the pandemic enters its fifth year, here’s what experts expect to change ﻿— and what to stay the same By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published December 18, 2023 z_wei / Getty Images It’s been about four years since COVID-19 was first identified, and in that time, much has changed, including the virus itself. We now have pills that can treat it and at-home tests that can identify an infection. We also have vaccines that have been updated to better match versions of the virus that are currently circulating. Despite these achievements, COVID-19 is still with us — and will be for some time, health experts say. Here’s what we can expect as we head into our fifth year with COVID-19. 1. COVID probably won’t settle into a predictable patte﻿rn The cold-weather months are synonymous with respiratory viruses. But unlike flu and RSV — where activity picks up in the fall and winter and peters off in the spring and summer — COVID-19 doesn’t have a set season. Waves hit in the winter, spring, summer and fall. While COVID could settle into a more predictable pattern in the future, that likely won’t happen in 2024, says Robert Murphy, M.D., an infectious disease expert and executive director of the Robert J. Havey, MD Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “COVID is different,” Murphy says. “It is its own thing.” If it did turn into a fall and winter virus, says Andrew Pekosz, a professor of microbiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, that could be helpful for a few reasons. “That makes vaccination approaches and various public health messaging a lot easier than something that’s around year-round and we’re just waiting for unpredictable surges to occur,” Pekosz says. Knowing when to expect the worst can also help hospitals and health care providers prepare for an uptick in patients. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. 2. New variants will continue to emerge Remember how easy it was to keep track of the virus during those first years of the pandemic? There was alpha, then beta, then delta, then omicron. Now, the variant pool is more like a crowded alphabet soup, with new descendants of omicron emerging every few months, and with names that don’t exactly roll off the tongue — BA.2.86 and FL.1.5.1, for example. Get used to it, because virus experts say we can expect to see more variants in 2024. “The only constant in this whole thing really is continuous change. So people should expect that the virus will continue to evolve,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, M.D., a COVID-19 researcher and assistant professor of medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. For the most part, the virus has been making small changes since omicron arrived in late 2021, Pekosz says, and we’ve been able to adjust with updated vaccines that can target the more recent versions of the virus. But there’s no guarantee it will continue down this path. “The worry that I have is if they evolve in a different direction and the current vaccines become obsolete, then we have to design new ones, or our current vital antivirals become obsolete and we have to design a new one,” Al-Aly says. Individuals are not powerless when it comes to preventing new, potentially more dangerous variants, says Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. The more a virus circulates in a population, the more opportunities it has to mutate, so “if we are protecting ourselves and others from COVID-19, we are helping prevent new variants come popping up,” Guest says. “Every new case is a place for a variant to happen.” 3. We’ll﻿ get closer to solving the mystery of ﻿long COVID Millions of people who have had COVID-19 experience lingering, sometimes disabling symptoms that can interfere with everyday life — a phenomenon known as long COVID. So much remains unknown about the condition, but that could soon change. “I think 2024 hopefully will give us more answers than we have right now,” Al-Aly says. A big reason has to do with new studies underway. The National Institutes of Health recently launched large-scale clinical trials to better understand, treat and prevent long COVID. One will investigate whether the COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid can help to improve symptoms of the mysterious condition. Another will study interventions to help with brain fog, memory loss and other cognitive complications caused by long COVID. Results from this research initiative, which includes a few other studies, will be published on a rolling basis. Over the next year, Al-Aly is hopeful that we’ll also learn more about why and how long COVID occurs, or its so-called mechanism. Doing so could lend some insight on how to prevent it in the first place, he says. “I do hope 2024 will not only further enhance national awareness of the problem, but also our ability to tackle it [medically],” he adds. 4. We’ll probably have﻿ new vaccine﻿s Given the changing nature of the virus, it’s likely the COVID-19 vaccine will be updated next year to match whatever new versions of the virus are spreading, much like how the flu shot gets updated annually, says Rachel Presti, M.D., professor of medicine and medical director of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Unit at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “We’re already seeing [the virus] shift a little bit away from the vaccine that we’re giving this year,” even though this new vaccine, released in September, is a much better match for the current variants than last year’s vaccine would have been, Presti says. You might also hear more about a combined flu-COVID vaccine in 2024. That’s because vaccine manufacturers are testing a single shot that helps protect against both influenza and the coronavirus. Early trial data has produced positive results, and Phase 3 studies are in the works. “I’m really excited about them,” Pekosz says. “All the same reasons that you would get the flu vaccine are the same reasons you would get the COVID vaccine, yet we’re seeing a really big difference in terms of people who take the COVID vaccine versus the influenza vaccine.” According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), roughly 42 percent of adults in the U.S. received a flu shot,as of Dec. 14, while only 18 percent of adults got the new COVID-19 vaccine. “So I’m hoping that a combination vaccine will really send the message to most of the population, particularly those who are susceptible to severe COVID or influenza, that, look, here’s a simple way for you to protect yourself from both of these very dangerous pathogens — one and done,” Pekosz says. Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/best-hydrating-foods/,"Extreme Heat View Series 13 Foods With High Water Content Add these delicious, refreshing fruits, vegetables and soups to your diet to help you stay hydrated By Sheryl Jean, AARP Comments En español Published June 18, 2024 AARP (Source: Stocksy; Getty Images(3)) This summer promises to be a scorcher in many parts of the country, so it will be important to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. That’s even more important for older adults, who may not drink enough water or are more susceptible to becoming dehydrated, which can cause a host of health problems. “The climate people live in has a big impact [on hydration],” says Bethany Agusala, M.D., medical director at UT Southwestern’s William T. and Gay F. Solomon General Internal Medicine Clinic in Dallas. “In Texas last year, we had more than 40 days in the 100s. You have to be a lot more conscientious about your fluid intake,” says Agusala, who also is certified in lifestyle nutrition. So, how much water should you consume? You’ve probably heard advice to drink eight 8-ounce glasses (64 ounces) of water a day. But newer recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine say that figure should be higher for adults age 50-plus: about 91 ounces for women and 125 ounces for men. For details, read “Do You Really Need 8 Glasses of Water a Day?” If the daily drinking-water recommendation seems like a lot to you, there’s a simple solution: Eat more water-rich foods. The daily recommendation includes water from food as well as beverages other than water. The body typically gets about 20 percent of the water it needs from food. Dehydration dangers That’s a good thing because older adults tend to drink less liquid. One study found that up to 60 percent of older adults aren’t adequately hydrated. And a 2019 study published in the journal SAGE Open Nursing found that the reasons for older adults not drinking enough included a long-held aversion to drinking water, forgetting to drink and fear of urinary incontinence. Furthermore, people experience a decreased thirst sensation after age 65, but that can start developing in your 50s, especially in people who have chronic diseases that affect fluid balance, such as type 2 diabetes, says Janet Mentes, coauthor of the SAGE Open Nursing study and professor emerita at the UCLA School of Nursing. Moreover, older adults tend to lose muscle mass, which holds more fluid than fat, so their total body water decreases as they age, she notes. Benefits of hydration as we age About half of the body weight of adults age 50-plus is water, depending on a variety of factors including gender, health and level of physical activity. In addition to helping keep you hydrated, water provides many health benefits, including helping to regulate blood pressure, aiding in digestion, and maintaining healthy cells so organs, including the brain, function properly. More ways to consume water may help older adults avoid dehydration, which “underlies a lot of health problems,” such as falls, urinary tract infections and heart issues, Mentes says. Less fluid also affects the body’s ability to process medications, she adds. And a recent study from the National Institutes of Health suggests adults who aren’t adequately hydrated age faster, face a higher risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart failure and stroke, and are more likely to die younger. For more, read ""8 Signs of Dehydration You Shouldn’t Ignore."" Many fruits and vegetables — typically when eaten raw — contain a high percentage of water, along with vitamins and nutrients. And Agusala says that frozen fruits and vegetables are “just as nutritious as fresh because they’re frozen just as they’re picked.” Other foods also provide high water content but may contain extra sodium or sugar. Nutritionists advise reading the labels on store-bought food and buying low-sodium, low-sugar or sugar-free products when possible. Turn to summer salads because they’re typically full of ingredients that contain a lot of water, such as lettuce, cucumbers, celery and even strawberries or watermelon. “If you eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, you’ll get enough fluids,” Mentes says. Foods packed with water Here are 13 foods that with a high-water content (per the U.S. Department of Agriculture) to help you stay hydrated. 1. Cucumber (96%) One of the highest water-content foods you can eat, cucumber also has a lot of vitamin C, which is important for bone health and the body’s healing process, and potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure. Dill or kosher pickles also contain a lot of water: 95 percent. 2. Iceberg lettuce (96%) All leafy greens have a high water content: 90 percent or more. Although iceberg lettuce has the highest water level, it has fewer nutrients and antioxidants than darker greens, Agusala says. So to get the most nutrients and water from your salad, mix your greens. 3. Tomato (95%) Tomatoes contain vitamins C and K, which aids in blood clotting and building bones, as well as potassium. Interestingly, tomatoes have different nutritional benefits when eaten cooked or raw. Raw tomatoes have vitamin C but cooking destroys it. Processed tomatoes — canned or juiced — are high in lycopene, which research has found can help lower blood pressure. So load up on nutrients and hydration by eating tomatoes raw, cooked and pureed, juiced or canned. 4. Celery (95%) Celery is high in fiber, with vitamins A, C and K and other nutrients. It’s a food you can eat without gaining weight — two stalks typically have only 15 calories — and is easy on the budget as well. Make a yogurt dip with dill or other favorite herbs for a low-calorie, nutritious, hydrating snack. 5. Ice pops (94%) There’s nothing better than an ice-cold popsicle on a hot summer day. Many do contain sugar, so consider buying sugar-free options. To control the sugar content, Mentes also suggests making your own with fresh fruit juice and freezing them. 6. Bell peppers (92–94%) Green bell peppers contain the most water of any pepper (94 percent) but the least vitamin C (100 milligrams). Orange bell peppers provide the most vitamin C (158 mg) and are 92 percent water. Use a mix of green, orange and red peppers in your salads and recipes to reap the benefits of plentiful H₂0 and nutrients. 7. Mushrooms (88–92%) Many mushrooms are a good source of water as well as potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin D and various antioxidants, which help fight inflammation and protect cells from damage, Agusala says. Cremini, portabella and white button mushrooms are among those with the highest water content. 8. Soup/broth (92–98%) Broths and soups are mostly water, but store-bought versions may contain high amounts of sodium, which isn’t good for older adults who are prone to high blood pressure, Agusala says. She recommends buying low-sodium options or making your own. Make (and eat) a low-salt veggie soup with carrots, celery and mushrooms and you’ll be well along on meeting your hydration and nutrient needs for the day. 9. Watermelon (91%) This summer classic lives up to its name. It’s also high in vitamins C and A. Eat a slice or two for a hydrating, vitamin-packed dessert or make a feta cheese and watermelon salad over mixed greens for a dish that provides protein, vitamins, antioxidants and, of course, plenty of water. And for once Mom wasn’t right — eating the seeds won’t cause a baby watermelon to sprout in your stomach. In fact, the seeds have nutrients such as zinc, iron, protein and even a bit of water. 10. Apples (8﻿4-85%) All apples have plenty of water content, but different varieties contain slightly different percentages of water. Honeycrisp and Granny Smith apples have some of the highest amounts, each at 85 percent. Apples also contain fiber, potassium, B-complex vitamins and vitamin C. 11. Grapes (78–80%) Green seedless grapes have a bit more water (80 percent) than red seedless (78 percent). Both types provide potassium and vitamin C. 12. Plain yogurt (81–87%) The amount of water varies by the type of yogurt, with plain nonfat yogurt offering the most (87 percent). Yogurt provides many nutrients, including calcium, potassium, vitamin A and vitamin D, which promotes calcium absorption and bone health. Agusala suggests avoiding flavored yogurt, which contains added sugar. If you need a little sweetness, stir in a teaspoon of honey instead, 13. Carrots (88–89%) Carrots have calcium and magnesium, which aids in regulating many body functions, including muscles, nerves and heart rhythm. And, yes, they are good for eye health, with vitamin A that’s important for the retina and vitamin C that’s linked to lower risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/high-blood-pressure-symptoms-and-causes/,"High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): A Guide to Symptoms, Causes and Tests Explore risk factors for high blood pressure, testing options and why it is known as the silent killer By Kimberly Hayes, AARP Reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published June 03, 2024 Getty Images High Blood Pressure Guide Symptoms, causes and tests Stages and types Treatment and prevention High blood pressure myths Alcohol and blood pressure Hypertension headache myths Smoking and high blood pressure Anxiety, stress and hypertension Is hypertension genetic? Medications that raise blood pressure Home blood pressure monitoring Surprising causes of hypertension A staggering three-quarters of Americans over age 60 have high blood pressure, otherwise known as hypertension, putting them at increased risk for stroke, heart attack and heart failure. Men tend to have higher blood pressure rates in their younger years, but women catch up around the time of menopause. Hypertension increases with age: ﻿Only 22.4 percent of people ages 18–39﻿ have the condition. But those numbers rise to 54.5 percent for people age 40–59 and 74.5 percent for people 60 and over. These alarming rates are even higher for people of color, especially for African Americans. Hypertension prevalence across all ages is higher among non-Hispanic Black adults (57.1 percent) than non-Hispanic white (43.6 percent) or Hispanic (43.7 percent) adults. ﻿ What causes high blood pressure? “The main cause of high blood pressure is aging blood vessels,” said Jordana Cohen, MD, MSCE, Associate Professor of Medicine, Renal-Electrolyte and Hypertension at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. She is also chair of the Hypertension Science Committee for the American Heart Association. Blood vessels tend to stiffen with age and becomes less flexible, which can drive up the pressure inside them. However, studies have found that there are populations of older people who don’t have high blood pressure, for example the remote South American Yanoma﻿mi tribe, whose members live in near-total isolation in the rainforests in southern Venezuela and northern Brazil. They eat very little salt and fat and have a diet high in plantains, fruit and meat, and their blood pressures stay the same as when they were younger. Research suggests that this could be related to their lower consumption of salt, and the fact that they eat a lot of potassium, Cohen said. They also have less exposure to modern-day risk factors such as pollution, stress and other diseases that are prevalent in our society, such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease, which all contribut﻿e to high blood pressure, Cohen added. Understanding a blood pressure reading Blood pressure is measured in stages, with a normal range being less than 120/80. The top number — the systolic— measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The bottom number — the diastolic — measures the pressure in your arteries when the blood is flowing back to the heart through the veins. Your blood pressure numbers are measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Stages at or above 120/80 include: elevated, stage 1 hypertension and stage 2 hypertension. A severely elevated blood pressure of 180/120 or greater can be a hypertensive crisis and could require guidance from your doctor, or in some cases, emergency care. VIDEO: How to Read Your Own Blood Pressure “The top number is what’s mostly considered our biggest indicator of risk,” Cohen said. It also tends to be the most responsive to treatment. The bottom number tends to be higher in younger people and then gets lower with age. Older patients can see a very wide split between their top and the bottom number, which can be concerning, Cohen said, especially if the bottom number gets too low as it can increase the risk of falls and kidney problems. “This is something that I see in my much older patients in their 80s, 90s and 100s.” ​ What are symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people with hypertension﻿ shouldn’t expect to experience symptoms from high blood pressure. “If your expectation is that you’re going to feel it, then you’re going to be somebody who’s missing it 90 percent of the time,﻿” Cohen said. Generally, people will not feel any symptoms of high blood pressure unless they are having the severely elevated blood pressure, which occurs when a patient’s underlying high blood pressure has accelerated to 180/120 or above and is damaging their vital organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys or eyes. In this scenario the person could face additional symptoms including sudden headache, blurred vision or vomiting, and should seek emergency medical assistance. It’s important to note that people with poorly controlled blood pressure could have readings in this higher range, but as long as they are not having other symptoms it may not be an emergency. However, they still should follow up with their doctor within a couple of days. Measuring your blood pressure While patients may assume a blood pressure measurement at ﻿a doctor’s office is the most accurate, that’s not always the case. To get a good blood pressure reading, it’s recommended the person sit in a qui﻿et environment with their feet flat on the floor and their arms on a table or desk in front of them, which may not always be how you are positioned at the doctor’s office. Couple that with the stress of a doctor’s visit﻿, and it’s easy to see how readings may not be 100 percent accurate. White coat hypertension and masked hypertension According to the Cleveland Clinic, between 15 to ﻿30 percent of people have so-called white coat hypertension, which means their blood pressure is higher at ﻿a health care provider’s office, but normal at home. ﻿﻿Estimates vary, however, with some research saying up to 50 percent or more people have white coat hypertension. High Blood Pressure Guide Symptoms, causes and tests Stages and types Treatment and prevention High blood pressure myths Alcohol and blood pressure Hypertension headache myths Smoking and high blood pressure Anxiety, stress and hypertension Is hypertension genetic? Medications that raise blood pressure Home blood pressure monitoring Surprising causes of hypertension VIDEO: How to Read Your Own Blood Pressure But it’s important not to discount these higher doctor’s office readings totally. “I think white coat can be used to deny high blood pressure,” said Beverly Green, M.D., senior investigator for Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. “There’s literature showing that people with white coat hypertension are higher risk of eventually getting high blood pressure.” At the opposite end of white coat hypertension is masked hypertension. Approximately 10 to 40 percent of people have this condition, which occurs when blood pressure is normal in the doctor’s office but high in everyday life. This can happen among people who typically smoke but avoid doing so right before a doctor’s visit. People who have sleep apnea could also be at risk, Cohen said. The importance of home blood pressure monitoring With home monitoring, patients can hopefully control their environment and take their readings at ideal times. (Look for guidelines on checking your blood pressure at home at the end of this article.) It’s important to make sure you are using an accurate device, and more than two-thirds of devices on the market right now are not, Cohen said. The website validatebp.org from the American Medical Association provides a list of devices that have been validated for accuracy and includes price ranges. It is of course important to still get your blood pressure checked at your doctor’s office and to discuss the readings you take at home with them. Some providers use an automated office blood pressure machine, which provide﻿s multiple readings over a series of intervals. This can be used in a quiet room without a medical professional present, hopefully reducing white coat hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring Some patients are referred for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, where your blood pressure is measured on a continuous basis for 24 hours as you live your daily life, even as you sleep. Your doctor will calculate the average blood pressure and also look at the range, how often readings are high or low, and if there is a “dip,” meaning a lowering of blood pressure﻿ during nighttime hours, which is normal.﻿ Ambulatory monitoring can be used for patients who have had high blood pressure readings but haven’t yet started treatment, need changes to their medications, or whose blood pressure is not responding to medications, or who have felt dizziness or have had fainting episodes. Green has used ambulatory monitoring herself and, to her surprise, found that she had high blood pressure during the workday. “I wouldn’t have known that I had high blood pressure while at work, and there are a lot of people walking around just like that whose hypertension wouldn’t have been caught otherwise,” Green added. It’s been shown both home monitors and the ambulatory monitors do a better job predicting heart attacks, strokes and death because they catch﻿ the variability in the average blood pressure much better th﻿an you can get from occasional blood pressure readings in the doctor’s office, Green said. Unfortunately, ambulatory monitoring can be difficult for some patients to access as it’s a subspecialty in medicine and not available in every doctor’s office, Cohen says. But studies have shown that home blood pressure monitoring﻿ with a store-bought monitor﻿ is a good surrogate for ambulatory. “It’s not expensive and everyone can do it.” Read more about home blood pressure monitoring.

Smoking and high blood pressure While smoking is not a primary risk factor for high blood pressure, the habit can ﻿damage blood vessels, contributing to plaque buildup and hardening arteries. Nicotine, the addictive chemical compound in cigarettes﻿, can also increase blood pressure. Read more about smoking and high blood pressure. Anxiety, stress and high blood pressure Stress can trigger blood pressure to rise in the short-term, and if that happens frequently enough, it could damage the blood vessels, heart and kidneys, similar to what happens in people with long-term hypertension. But that’s different from saying stress or anxiety themselves produce high blood pressure. ﻿ Read more about the links between anxiety, stress and high blood pressure. Is high blood pressure genetic? A May 2024 study in Nature Genetics analyzed the genes of more than 1 million people of European heritage and uncovered some 113 gene variants associated with high blood pressure. While you can’t change your genes, there are lifestyle changes you can make that will likely have a much bigger impact on your risk for high blood pressure. Read more about high blood pressure and genetics. Medications that cause high blood pressure Pain and migraine medicines, decongestants, corticosteroids and some herbal supplements are all examples of pills that could ra﻿ise your blood pressure. Yet a 2021 study revealed that 18.5 percent of adults with hypertension were taking one or more of these medications﻿.

Todd Detwiler How to properly measure your blood pressure at home Do’s: Make sure your blood pressure monitor has been validated at validatebp.org. Confirm that the cuff fits by measuring around your upper arm and choosing a monitor with the correct cuff size. Wrist and finger monitors are not recommended due to less reliable readings.​ Be in a quiet room, avoid conversation and relax for three to five minutes before taking your blood pressure. Make sure that you’re positioned correctly: Sit at a kitchen table or a desk where your feet are flat on the floor, your back is supported and your arms are resting on the table at the level of your heart. Put the cuff on your bare arm. If you must push your sleeve up, make sure it is loose fitting. A tight sleeve could create a tourniquet effect and raise your blood pressure. Empty your bladder prior to a reading. Having a full bladder can raise your blood pressure, according to the AMA. Take your blood pressure twice. People often get a surge of adrenaline when they first take the reading. Record your blood pressure measurements﻿, along with the time of day you took them, and discuss these results with your doctor. The AHA offers a printable blood pressure log. Don’t Smoke, eat or drink coffee﻿ or other caffeinate﻿d beverages﻿ at least 30 minutes before taking your blood pressure. “We usually recommend checking two back-to-back readings about 30 seconds to a minute apart in the morning, before taking medications … and two back-to-back readings in the evening before going to bed, at least an hour after dinner, for a minimum of three days per month,” said Jordana Cohen, MD, MSCE, Associate Professor of Medicine, Renal-Electrolyte and Hypertension at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. “That’s the minimum needed to get a really accurate reading.” Doing this series of checks once a month is recommended for people currently being treated with blood pressure medication. If your blood pressure is borderline, three days of monitoring every two to three months is recommended, Cohen said. ﻿ While these are general guidelines, you should discuss how frequently to take your blood pressure with your doctor, based on your individual medical needs.

But for some people, confusion gets pronounced, and simple tasks such as managing money and driving become difficult without assistance.﻿ Although there is no vaccine or cure for dementia, early diagnosis is still crucial. Seeking help early and getting a diagnosis offer time to try therapies that may slow disease progression and relieve troublesome symptoms. Such actions also give the patient and family members time to anticipate care needs and plan financially. In the United States, more than 7 million people are living with dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. As the older population grows, those numbers are expected to rise sharply. The average age of onset is around 84 years. When it comes to diagnosis, “there’s no specific blood test or brain scan to tell if you have dementia. We often make the diagnosis by bedside testing,” says geriatric psychiatrist Karen Severson, M.D., based in Jupiter, Florida. She’s referring to simple questions a doctor might ask or short cognitive tests to check a person’s ability to recall and communicate, such as drawing a clock face. Although she uses the term “bedside testing,” these evaluations more often happen during a visit to the doctor’s office. Getting a dementia diagnosis Symptoms of Dementia Dementia shows up in many ways.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/mixing-prescription-drugs-and-supplements/,"8 Supplements That Don’t Always Mix With Prescription Drugs Over-the-counter vitamins, herbs and minerals aren’t without potential risks By Constance Sommer, Updated April 25, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published April 06, 2022 / Updated April 25, 2025 Ganna Prykhodko / Getty Images Turmeric, ginseng, a probiotic, even vitamin C — all of these, when taken in packaged form, are supplements. Some have lined store shelves for decades. Others are ancient cures processed and packaged for 21st-century consumers. Whatever their history, supplements are everywhere these days, and consumers are eating them up, spending billions each year on capsules, powders and gummies. More than half of adults age 20 and older have taken one in the past 30 days, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found — and that percentage increases with age. Research from AARP shows that nearly 80 percent of adults 50 and older take a vitamin or dietary supplement. But what many adults don’t realize is that taking some of these supplements alongside prescription drugs and other medicines can have dangerous and even life-threatening effects. A number of supplements can enhance, diminish or negate a prescription drug in ways that can be consequential and unpredictable, says Laura Shane-McWhorter, a clinical professor of pharmacology at the University of Utah. Still, federal research shows about 34 percent of survey participants — representing roughly 72 million people in the United States — take some kind of dietary supplement along with a prescription medication. Wondering which supplement-prescription pairings can be risky? Here are six popular supplements and their known effects on some common medications. 1. St. John’s wort Derived from a flowering shrub native to Europe, St. John’s wort is often taken to treat mild to moderate depression, or to reduce menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. But it has numerous drug interactions and can reduce the potency of birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy, Shane-McWhorter says. It can also interfere with omeprazole (Prilosec), alprazolam (Xanax), certain statins and some antihistamines, Mayo Clinic reports. What’s more, St. John’s wort can render the COVID-19 antiviral treatment Paxlovid powerless. “If a person is being treated with Paxlovid and is taking St. John’s wort, that means essentially that the Paxlovid may not work,” Shane-McWhorter says. 2. CoQ10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant produced by our bodies to promote cell growth and maintenance; the levels of it in our body can decrease as we age. In supplement form, it’s taken by way of capsules, tablets and syrups for numerous conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and migraine. But CoQ10 can also interfere with the ability of blood thinners to do their job, which is to prevent blood clots from forming. As a result, “people could have a breakthrough blood clot,” Shane-McWhorter says. 3. Turmeric The ancient spice has been shown to have many health benefits, from improving memory to lowering inflammation and even decreasing the risk of heart disease. It also has anticoagulant effects, which means you don’t want to mix turmeric supplements with a blood thinner or even, possibly, aspirin, due to the risk of internal bleeding, Shane-McWhorter says. Ginkgo biloba (an herb) and vitamin E are two other dietary supplements that can thin the blood, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). So taking them with an anticoagulant can augment the effect. Cooking with turmeric? It’s still fine to use in the kitchen, Shane-McWhorter says. “When products are used as foods, we don’t think it’s that much of an issue at all,” she adds. The FDA and Dietary Supplements Unlike its role for over-the-counter medications and prescription drugs, the Food and Drug Administration is not in charge of making sure dietary supplements are safe before they hit store shelves. Similarly, the agency doesn’t review supplements for effectiveness before consumers can purchase them. The FDA can, however, take action if a product is found to have a false or misleading label or contain an unsafe ingredient. 4. Probiotics Full of beneficial bacteria, probiotics are often taken to aid digestion and improve gut health. But don’t take one within two hours of taking an antibiotic, or you could reduce the effectiveness of the prescription medication, Shane-McWhorter says. 5. Vitamin C Vitamin C occurs naturally in citrus fruits, strawberries, broccoli and tomatoes, among other foods. It’s also consumed as a supplement for a myriad of reasons, ranging from warding off the common cold to preventing cancer. But high-dose vitamin C supplements may reduce the effectiveness of some types of cancer chemotherapy, says Courtney Rhodes, a spokeswoman for the FDA. It can also interfere with niacin and statins and affect estrogen levels, according to Mayo Clinic. 6. Milk thistle A flowering plant related to daisies, milk thistle is taken as a supplement to promote liver and heart health. It may also lower blood sugar, which could be a concern for someone who’s on diabetes medication. When combined with insulin, it can be “like taking a little bit too much” glucose-lowering medication, Shane-McWhorter says. The FDA and Dietary Supplements Unlike its role for over-the-counter medications and prescription drugs, the Food and Drug Administration is not in charge of making sure dietary supplements are safe before they hit store shelves. Similarly, the agency doesn’t review supplements for effectiveness before consumers can purchase them. The FDA can, however, take action if a product is found to have a false or misleading label or contain an unsafe ingredient. 7. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha’s popularity has skyrocketed in recent years. The supplement is commonly promoted to help with stress and anxiety, and research suggests it can be effective for some. That said, talking to your doctor before introducing a new supplement into your routine is key, especially if you are taking other medications. The National Center for Integrative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) says there’s evidence that ashwagandha can interact with drugs used for diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as immunosuppressants, sedatives, anti-seizure medications and thyroid hormone medicines. 8. Chamomile Chamomile is often promoted as an herbal supplement to soothe a cough or the common cold. It’s also touted as a way to reduce anxiety. But chamomile might have some of the same effects as estrogen, according to NIH, and early studies suggest that taking chamomile along with birth control pills might decrease their effect. What’s more, interactions between chamomile and warfarin (a blood thinner) have been reported, the National Center for Integrative Medicine says. Bottom line: Talk to your doctor Ideally, to head off trouble, patients would be talking to their doctors about the supplements they are taking. But these conversations don’t happen as often as they should, says Derjung Mimi Tarn, M.D., a professor of family medicine at University of California, Los Angeles. A study led by Tarn and her colleagues in 2015 found that fewer than 50 percent of patients disclose the use of dietary supplements, and even among those who do, only about one-third of the supplements taken are mentioned to doctors. One reason for the disconnect: Patients may not realize the over-the-counter herbs or extra vitamins they’re working into their daily pile of pills count as anything that needs to be discussed with a doctor, so they leave them off the list when their provider asks, Shane-McWhorter explains. It’s also not uncommon for consumers to confuse “natural” with “safe” and fail to fully recognize the potency of some of these products. To help avoid any health hazards that can arise from mixing supplements and medications, it’s important to ask your doctor about possible adverse reactions before starting any new medication or supplement, Tarn says. “Greater awareness of the importance of discussing supplement use is needed in both providers and patients,” she adds. The FDA suggests bringing a list of everything you take — over-the-counter medicines (pain pills, allergy relief, etc.), dietary supplements and prescription drugs — with you to your next routine appointment to make sure your information is up to date. And be sure to keep track of the dosages and how many times a day you take them. Also, if you’re planning a surgery, don’t be surprised if your doctor asks you to stop taking dietary supplements two or three works before the procedure to avoid changes in heart rate, blood pressure or bleeding risk. Interested in learning more? The NIH has a database where you can search for a supplement and find links to verified sources with information about the product and its interactions. And Herbs at a Glance is an alphabetical listing of herbs and botanicals, with information on their uses and safety concerns, from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, a division of the NIH. For those willing to pay, Shane-McWhorter recommends the Natural Medicines database, where subscribers can use the interaction checker and the effectiveness checker to learn more about particular supplements. ﻿ Editor’s Note: This story, originally published April 6, 2022, has been updated with new information.","The article explores the potential risks of combining dietary supplements with prescription medications, highlighting the importance of consulting doctors before taking supplements. Key findings include the identification of eight supplements (St. John's Wort, CoQ10, Turmeric, Probiotics, Vitamin C, Milk Thistle, Ashwagandha, and Chamomile) that can interact with common medications, potentially leading to adverse effects.

Weight loss most importantly needs a calorie deficit, or energy deficit. So that means you could eat only “junk food” and still lose weight as long as you ate less calories than your body was using,” says Sarah Wagner, a registered dietician at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. “No one food can make you lose weight.” Still, Wagner emphasizes that choosing nutritious foods is key for overall health. These foods help keep you full, hydrate your body, and provide the nourishment needed to thrive. Fruits and vegetables are important in a healthy diet, but no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients you need. For overall health and weight goals, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and whole grains, among its other benefits, has a positive effect on blood sugar, helping to keep appetite in check and promote weight loss, according to Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate from the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Avoiding sugary beverages, which are high in calories and low in nutritional value﻿, is part of the weight-control picture﻿, as is adding foods with high protein and fiber to your grocery list. And, of course, although it’s not a dietary recommendation, remaining active plays a role in controlling weight. ​ Here are 14 foods that can help you reach your weight goals. Although these foods burn calories, consider them only part of the weight-loss effort, which also involves regular physical activity, adequate sleep and controlling stress. Foods to eat to lose weight 1. Apples These crunchy beauties are low in calories, high in fiber and filling, all attributes that benefit weight loss. A medium apple contains approximately 5 grams of fiber, enough to slow digestion so you don’t feel hungry after a snack or a meal. Apples also boast a high water content; about 85 percent of their weight is water, which helps to temper your appetite. According to the Cleveland Clinic, apples make a satisfying snack, and choosing a healthy snack over a doughnut can help you maintain a healthy weight. So grab an apple on your way out the door. You’ll look better and feel better. 2. Asparagus ﻿ Getty Images The delicate stalks of asparagus, which are harvested in spring, are low in fat and calories﻿ —﻿ really low. Half a cup, five cooked spears, contains only 20 calories, but those lovely stalks are high in soluble and insoluble fiber. Both types help keep you feeling full between meals because your body digests fiber slowly, so you’re less likely to get hungry. The downside: ﻿Asparagus contains a unique compound that gives urine a punky odor. Take heart: ﻿The odor generally dissipates within 24 to 48 hours. 3. Avocados What all avocados have in common, whether small or large, is that they’re pear-shaped, have creamy green flesh and a pit and are packed with calories. But those calories don’t necessarily mean that avocados will pack on pounds. People who eat avocados routinely tend to feel fuller for longer and eat less throughout the day. A study published in the journal Nutrients concluded that men and women who weren’t overweight to begin with and ate avocados regularly had lower odds of becoming overweight or obese. Getty Images 4. Broccoli Green heads of broccoli are available year﻿-round, mild in taste and,﻿ best of all, beneficial in weight loss. Water accounts for more than 90 percent of broccoli’s content. Carbs, protein and a little fat make up the rest. Broccoli, like other nonstarchy vegetables, is low in calories (about 35 per cup) and rich in fiber, making it a filling food that can help control weight. The leaves and stems of broccoli are nutritious, but the florets have an even higher concentration of nutrients and phytochemicals, naturally occurring chemical compounds produced by plants. However, you may want to introduce broccoli into your diet slowly; it has been known to increase intestinal gas and flatul﻿ence. 5. Fish For older adults looking to cut calories from fattier meats, fish—especially canned varieties packed in water—can be a great option. It’s loaded with omega-3 fats, rich in nutrients like vitamin D and selenium, high in protein, and low in saturated fat. Including one to two 3-ounce servings of fatty fish per week, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines, may lower the risk of dying from heart disease by 36%, according to a JAMA review of 20 studies. 6. Carrots Forget the Bugs Bunny jokes, it’s time to take carrots seriously. Research suggests that including fiber-rich carrots in your diet helps curb your appetite. If you want to lose weight, eat food that contains more water and fewer calories. Here’s where carrots come in. A medium raw carrot is about 88 percent water and contains only 25 calories. If you’ve had enough of orange carrots, the most popular color, you can also find red, purple, yellow and white carrots. 7. Cottage cheese People generally don’t think of cottage cheese as sophisticated or suave or worldly. But its lumpy looks hide a world of benefits, according to dietitian Julia Zumpano, of the Cleveland Clinic. Forget Swiss ﻿cheese or cheddar and head straight for cottage cheese, she advises. It’s high in protein, which helps curb your appetite and manage hormones associated with appetite and digestion. And﻿, believe it or not, cottage cheese has become trendy. For those with lactose intolerance, cottage cheese has lower levels than many dairy foods, and lactose-free cottage cheese is available. Getty Images 8. Eggs Whether you scramble them, hard-boil them or coddle them, eggs are a great way to start the day if you’re trying to take off extra pounds. They’re low in calories and packed with protein, which takes longer to digest, leaving you feeling satisfied and less likely to overeat at your next meal. An Australia﻿n study that provided either a breakfast of eggs and toast or cereal with milk and orange juice to overweight or obese men and women found that those who ate the egg breakfast felt less hungry and ate significantly less at lunch. Those concerned about their cholesterol may want to avoid or limit eating egg yolk﻿s and enjoy egg whites instead. For example, try an omelet with three egg whites and just one egg yolk. 9. Lentils and other pulses Lentils, chickpeas, beans and peas all belong to a plant family called legumes with edible seeds known as pulses. Eating about one serving a day of these nutritionally dense seeds promotes a feeling of satiety, a term researchers use when they mean a person has eaten enough to feel full. This satiety may lead to weight loss and better weight management. According to a study from the University of Toronto, participants lost an average of ¾ of a pound over six weeks﻿ ﻿b﻿y simply adding less than a cup of these seeds to their regular diet. Even more important, this modest amount seemed to prevent them from gaining it back. 10. Mushrooms Add sauteed mushrooms to your scrambled eggs in the morning for a great way to start the day. “Mushrooms can be an important part of a diet that helps with weight loss,” says Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Highly nutritious mushrooms contribute a savory flavor called umami to food without much in the way of fat or calories, so they may help people feel full for few calories, Glenn notes. 11. Oats Oatmeal, a soothing, old-fashioned breakfast standby, doesn’t look like much, but it packs a mighty punch. People who eat cooked oatmeal regularly have a lower risk of becoming overweight. A cup of cooked oatmeal contains about 160 calories﻿ —﻿ not much﻿ —﻿ and nearly ﻿4 grams of a soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which encourages a feeling of fullness and dampens the urge to overeat. To add pizzazz to your morning bowl of oatmeal, dress it up with apple slices, fresh berries and chopped nuts. Be cautious about “instant” oatmeal, which tends to be processed and could contain added sugar and sodium and less fiber content. 12. Nuts Contrary to what you might expect, studies associate consuming nuts of all kinds with less weight gain. A study in the journal Nutrients determined that eating more nuts may help prevent long-term weight gain. In particular, Brazil nuts contain the mineral selenium, which may improve the health of your thyroid, which regulates metabolism. However, nuts are packed with calories, so portion control is key﻿; aim for about a handful. 13. Pears Pears come in all shapes﻿ —﻿ round and plump, chubby, knobby as fists and, of course, pear-shaped. No matter what the fruit looks like, researchers concluded that men and women who made pears part of their everyday diet had a lower body weight than those who ignored them. The people who ate pears were 35 percent less likely to be obese﻿, and their diets were of higher quality. The study, published in Nutrition & Food Science, noted that people who ate pears had higher﻿-than﻿-usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper and potassium, all of them important for the body to function well. 14. Leafy Greens Arugula, romaine lettuce, spinach, kale, ‘spring mix,’ and other leafy greens are an excellent way to pack in nutrients without adding many calories. Even better for weight loss, they’re high in fiber, which helps keep you feeling full longer by slowing digestion, says Rush University System in Chicago. 4 Foods that sabotage weight-loss plans If you’re trying to lose weight, beware of the hidden calories in these supposed “health foods.” Here are four to avoid, courtesy of Emory University: Fruit-flavored yogurt Although yogurt is a healthy addition to a weight-loss diet, flavored yogurt is often boosted with added sugar﻿ —﻿ as much as 31 grams to a 6-ounce container. That’s almost 8 teaspoons of sugar! Ouch! Fast-food salads Beware the toppings on prepackaged salads. The dressings and add-ons can rack up as much as 500 unwanted calories. Enhanced water These drinks marketed as water typically contain artificial flavors and sweeteners. Refined grains Whole grains provide a ton of health benefits. They contain all parts of the grain, including fiber, B vitamins and essential fatty acids. But ﻿once the grain is refined to make it easier to use in cookies, cakes and breads, it leaves only the endosperm, which is nutrient-poor starch. Read the label and look for the word ﻿“whole﻿” before the grain listed. In addition, stay away from: Commercially baked cookies and cakes, which are often high in fructose, a type of sugar that can reduce feelings of fullness and increase your desire to eat. Fried foods and potato chips, including commercial french fries, which may taste good but won’t fill you up for long. Candy bars — well, you knew that. How to add weight-loss foods to your diet Keep fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods you enjoy on hand for easy snacks and meals, says Hawkins. To avoid spoilage, consider stocking up on frozen fruits and vegetables. Canned fruits and vegetables are another good shelf-stable option, as long as they’re free of added sugar or salt. Tip: Rinsing canned foods before using them can help wash away excess sodium and preservatives. “I love a hearty salad that includes a green vegetable, a whole grain or starchy vegetable, beans, lentils, or nuts, and healthy fats,” Hawkins adds. “For example, a salad with finely chopped kale, roasted sweet potatoes, toasted walnuts, goat cheese, and a vinaigrette makes a delicious combination. For a complete meal, you could serve it with a salmon fillet.” Soups and stews are another great way to assemble a balanced meal—plus, they’re budget-friendly if you use leftovers. Think chili with lean ground beef or turkey, beans, and fresh or canned produce paired with a whole grain. How to find your ideal portion size For personalized guidance, consider asking your doctor or dietitian for nutrition counseling. Medicare even covers medical nutrition therapy for patients with diabetes or kidney disease. “Listening to your body’s hunger and fullness cues is helpful so that you’re eating when hungry and stopping when full,” says Hawkins. For general tips, Hawkins suggests using MyPlate.gov as a resource for understanding food groups and serving sizes tailored to different calorie needs. “Generally, I recommend making half your plate fruits and vegetables, a quarter lean protein, and a quarter starch to create a filling meal without going overboard on calories,” she adds.

Here’s how it works and what to expect By Michael Schroeder, AARP Comments En español Published March 17, 2025 AARP (Getty Images) Some people can’t fall asleep at night; others drift off easily but awaken in the wee hours. Some people snore, and some act out their dreams. Whatever goes bump in the night, sleep troubles aren’t without consequence. Left unchecked, undiagnosed and untreated, sleep disorders can start the dominoes falling, dangerously disrupting cardiovascular function, undermining overall health and making it difficult to get through the day. That’s why you should never resign yourself to poor sleep, says Clete Kushida, M.D., a neurologist specializing in sleep disorders. Instead, talk to your doctor, who can help determine the root cause of your overnight issues. “We know that sleep and sleep disorders have a profound impact on health,” says Kushida, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and medical director of sleep medicine at Stanford University. Sleep loss and sleep deprivation — independent of sleep disorders — can be disruptive and can affect your health in some ways, for example, with weight gain. “But with sleep disorders, like obstructive sleep apnea, there’s a strong link [to] endocrine disorders, high blood pressure, stroke, heart attack — all these things,” Kushida says. Research conducted by AARP finds that 70 percent of adults ages 40 and older experience sleep difficulties. However, 4 in 10 adults with untreated sleep issues presume that their poor sleep isn’t that serious. What can you learn from a sleep study? Health risks of interrupted sleep Untreated sleep disorders can increase your risk of several health conditions, including: Heart failure High blood pressure Stroke Diabetes Depression Sleep tests can help your doctor diagnose sleep-related disorders. Source: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Uncovering what’s happening when you turn out the lights can take some detective work, so often doctors will refer patients with sleep issues — or suspected disorders — for a sleep study to evaluate what’s happening when you’re dozing, says Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, M.D., a spokesperson and board member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and medical director of sleep medicine for Millennium Physician Group in Fort Myers, Florida. That includes monitoring a person’s breathing, heart rate and other vital signs. According to Medicare claims data, hundreds of thousands of these studies are conducted each year among older adults. The aim of a sleep study is to pinpoint what kind of issues a patient is struggling with overnight. There are around 90 different sleep disorders, which are grouped into six major categories, Kushida says, including: Insomnia, defined as difficulty falling or staying asleep or waking up too early.Circadian-related sleep disorders, like delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, which causes a person to stay up and wake up later than they want.Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea, where relaxed throat muscles block the airway, stopping breathing many times a night.Sleep-related movement disorders, like restless legs syndrome.Parasomnias, which are unusual behaviors during sleep, like sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder.Narcolepsy and hypersomnias, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Not every sleep study results in a diagnosis; and sometimes, multiple studies might be needed. But the data gathered helps doctors piece together what’s going on by documenting everything from a patient’s breathing difficulties to changes in heart rate and brain activity as well as significant movement overnight, Kushida notes. “Additionally we have daytime tests that can also help to diagnose if the person has significant daytime sleepiness or might have things like narcolepsy,” Kushida says. Health risks of interrupted sleep Untreated sleep disorders can increase your risk of several health conditions, including: Heart failure High blood pressure Stroke Diabetes Depression Sleep tests can help your doctor diagnose sleep-related disorders. Source: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute What does a sleep study entail? Though some people might be able to do a sleep study at home, these tests typically occur in a sleep lab, which is often a room at a sleep medicine center where a patient can be monitored overnight. With an at-home sleep test, a small portable device monitors a person’s breathing and oxygen intake while they’re sleeping. “It is basically a respiratory monitor that is used to determine if a patient has sleep apnea or not,” explains Ana Krieger, M.D., medical director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. While home tests are becoming more sophisticated, doctors say they’re often used to diagnose or rule out sleep apnea. “It’s really not a good test if the doctor’s concerned about something else,” Krieger says. On the other hand, in-lab sleep studies offer a more comprehensive look at what’s happening overnight and boast more intricate technologies. Krieger says the diagnostic tools used in the lab, collectively called polysomnography, have far more wires and cables than the at-home study devices. These added wires are attached to the patient’s head and face to monitor brain activity and the electrical activity of the heart, similar to an EKG (electrocardiogram) a patient might get while awake. A technician watches the patient and their vitals overnight. After the sleep test, the data is shared with a doctor who has special training in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. “Sometimes you can attach monitors to the arms and legs for patients that move a lot at night, or that you might want to evaluate because they might have Parkinson’s disease, they might be acting out dreams, or they might be having leg cramps at night,” Krieger says. “So we can always add more monitoring cables to evaluate the underlying problem.” All these intrusions into one’s personal space make sleep studies a challenge, especially since they are supposed to reflect real life. (And who can fall asleep with cables all over their body?) But accommodating patients — keeping the room quiet, comfortable, cool and dark, for example — is all part of it. “It’s awkward,” Abbasi-Feinberg admits. “Interestingly though, most people, once they sort of settle in, do sleep.” And imperfect zzz’s still provide invaluable data that helps clinicians more expertly evaluate sleep woes. Sleep studies are also low-impact and low-risk. “It’s not dangerous to have a sleep study in any way,” Abbasi-Feinberg says. Given the dire impact that untreated sleep disorders can have on a person’s life and health, Kushida urges those who aren’t sleeping well to get help. If you’re sleepy, your sleep is interrupted during the night, you (or a partner) notice any unusual behaviors during sleep, or you just can’t fall asleep, “definitely seek evaluation,” he says. What to know before you go To get the most from your sleep study, consider the source: Experts advise patients to go to accredited sleep medicine centers. To find a sleep clinic near you that’s accredited by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, go to sleepeducation.org, and enter your ZIP code. These centers typically offer at-home sleep tests as well. “Many other companies out there or online services perform tests with equipment that is not necessarily very valid,” Krieger cautions. “That then becomes a bit of a challenge because if the precision of the test is not great, you might have a result that may be wrong.” Be patient and persistent if more data or additional overnight tests are needed. You may need to work with your doctor to provide documentation to your insurance plan for coverage. While a single study might be sufficient to detect sleep apnea, “studies have shown that multiple nights are preferable — but it’s difficult to get multiple nights covered,” Kushida says. Medicare Part B and private insurance plans typically cover sleep studies if they’re considered “medically necessary,” Abbasi-Feinberg says. “If no one complains about something, you can’t just order a sleep study. But if somebody comes in with reason to have a sleep study, and the documentation is there, then insurance usually covers it,” Abbasi-Feinberg says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/tiredness-causes/,"7 Reasons You’re Always Tired What could be causing your fatigue — and how to fight it By Beth Howard, Updated August 14, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published June 23, 2020 / Updated August 14, 2023 Getty Images Burnt out and constantly depleted of energy? It’s not a good feeling, but know that you’re not alone. Research suggests that fatigue (or anergia, in medical lingo) runs as high as 50 percent in people 65 and older, compared with rates in the general population that range from 10 to 25 percent. It’s even more prevalent among adults living with health conditions that become more common with age, such as heart disease. As many as 74 percent of older adults with a chronic illness experience fatigue, a review of studies published in 2021 suggests. Yet “fatigue is not a natural consequence of aging,” says Barbara Resnick, codirector of the Biology and Behavior Across the Lifespan Organized Research Center at the University of Maryland School of Nursing. “It’s more related to the changes that occur due to age and commonly associated diseases.” Fatigue is common when you’re fighting any kind of illness — from infections, like flu or COVID-19, to autoimmune disorders. It’s also a side effect of some treatments, such as chemotherapy. Beyond that, “all of us feel tired some of the time,” says Suzanne Salamon, M.D., assistant professor of geriatric medicine and primary care at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “Usually, it goes away, either with sleep or time.” But if unexplained fatigue continues for more than a few weeks, it’s time to figure out what’s causing it. Here are some of the likely suspects (keep in mind, though, that more than one culprit may be responsible). 1. Your medications are sapping your energy “Older adults take a lot of medications, and a lot of those medications tend to make people feel tired,” says Brenda Windemuth, director of the Adult Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Program at the University of Maryland School of Nursing. Chief among these: certain antidepressants, antianxiety drugs, sedatives, antihistamines, steroids, and blood pressure and cholesterol medications. Antipsychotics, pain meds, seizure drugs and chemotherapy also stir up trouble. Others, like diuretics, contribute to exhaustion by disturbing your sleep. “Not all drugs cause the same effects in all people,” Salamon says. “If a person has started a new medicine and they notice fatigue, they should report this to the doctor. Sometimes just moving the drug to the evening or lowering the dose can help, but sometimes you need to change to a different medicine.” She recommends always bringing all your medicines — prescription and over-the-counter — to your office visits so your doctor can check doses and duplicates. 2. Your sleep hygiene may need improvement Many of us simply aren’t getting enough slumber — more than one-third of adults, to be exact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Poor sleep habits are often to blame. If you’re lying in bed and can’t fall asleep, Resnick advises, get up and do something until you feel tired, and then go back and try again. “The other really big mistake people make is that they expect to lie around all day and then be able to sleep at night,” she says. “You only want to spend time in bed when it’s sleep time. Some people like to control the world from their bed.” Other advice: Maintain a regular sleep pattern, and avoid alcohol at night. Consider keeping a sleep diary to help you identify factors — foods, drinks, medicines — that may be keeping you from solid slumber. Keep in mind that as you get older you may not require the seven to nine hours you used to, Windemuth says. Obstructive sleep apnea is another culprit. Patients experience as many as 30 awakenings an hour when the soft tissues of the throat relax and obstruct the airway during sleep; as a result, they feel exhausted the next day. Loud snoring is a clue. Spending the night in a sleep lab can confirm the diagnosis. The standard treatment, a continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) machine, involves wearing a mask over the nose to force air into the throat and keep the airways open. 3. You’re missing key nutrients People over 50 are more likely to experience nutrient deficiencies — especially vitamins B12 and D, iron and folic acid — that cause fatigue. If your doctor suspects a deficiency, they’ll send you for a blood test, and you may need a supplement. 4. You’re anemic This means that your blood has too few red cells or those cells have too little hemoglobin, which transports oxygen through the bloodstream. The result: fatigue. A simple blood test provides a diagnosis, after which your physician will investigate possible reasons for the anemia and may put you on iron pills. There are three main reasons older adults become anemic. Kidney disease is one. If your kidneys are not working properly, they may not be able to help your body make the red blood cells it needs. “It can also be due to blood loss from somewhere, usually along the gastrointestinal tract,” Resnick says, “or it’s in the bone marrow, which could be due to a malignancy.” 5. You have a heart or pulmonary problem Cardiac issues — including heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — are among the most common causes of fatigue in older people. Heart disease can cause the heart to pump blood less efficiently and fluid to build up in the lungs. This, in turn, results in shortness of breath and less oxygen supply to the heart and lungs. So be sure to follow doctor’s orders when it comes to treatment. 6. You’re anxious or depressed “Depression, being alone and other psychosocial issues are a huge factor in older people,” Windemuth says. “People are losing friends and spouses. They’re being uprooted from their homes or going into assisted living. That can lead to fatigue.” Antidepressant medications are sometimes the answer. “We also encourage people to go out, become more involved and find things that they really enjoy doing,” Windemuth adds. Paradoxically, exercise can make a huge difference. “The best thing for fatigue is physical activity — no matter what the underlying problem,” Resnick says. “The goal should be 30 minutes daily of moderate-level activity.” 7. COVID could be the culprit When COVID-19 symptoms linger long after a person’s initial illness, fatigue is the most common complaint. “Estimates of the prevalence are variable but some sources suggest that more than 50 percent of all COVID survivors are affected by persistent fatigue,” says John Baratta, M.D., founder and codirector of the UNC COVID Recovery Clinic at UNC Health in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. “In our long COVID clinic, over 90 percent are troubled by this symptom.” Before treating the fatigue, doctors first investigate other potential factors that may be contributing to extreme tiredness, such as sleep apnea, depression and chronic pain, says Benjamin Abramoff, M.D., head of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. Then you may be prescribed physical therapy or a graded exercise program, where the duration and intensity of activity are gradually increased. Both can improve stamina, but it’s important to pace yourself to avoid exacerbating symptoms or risking relapse, Baratta says. “We have also found benefits from certain medications, such as antidepressants and stimulants, in certain situations,” Baratta adds. These include certain antidepressants in the SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) class and stimulants like those used to treat attention deficit disorder. If you’re suffering from fatigue related to long COVID, ask your doctor about such strategies or consider making an appointment at a post-COVID clinic. These programs typically take a multidisciplinary approach to treating the disease’s lasting symptoms, fatigue included.

Find out who’s eligible as ﻿coronavirus cases, ER visits and hospitalizatio﻿ns climb﻿ By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published July 19, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Envato Elements(2)) Unlike influenza, RSV and other common respiratory illnesses, COVID-19 is not sitting out the summer season. In many areas of the U.S., COVID cases, emergency department visits and hospitalizations are increasing. And adults 65 and older are especially feeling the impact of the summer surge, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). At the end of June, hospitalization rates for this age group were roughly 14 times higher than for adults under 50. While COVID continues its summer spread, fueled by highly contagious variants, infectious disease experts say older adults can do some things to protect themselves from falling ill from an infection. It’s not too late for the COVID vaccine If the last time you rolled up your sleeve for a COVID vaccine was last fall, you may be eligible for another shot this summer. The CDC in February recommended that all adults 65 and older receive one additional dose of the vaccine that was updated and introduced in September. ﻿(People who are immunocompromised were already eligible for additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.) And William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said it’s not too late to take advantage of this recommendation now if you didn't back in the spring. All about coronavirus COVID’s summer wave Summer cold or COVID? Isolation guidelines change Members only: COVID 4 times Eligible for a booster shot? Medicare coverage details “Protection wanes over time,” Schaffner says. “And for [older people], who are frail, who have chronic underlying conditions, people who are immune compromised, by now their protection has diminished. So you can get another [shot] now, and then this fall, you can get the updated vaccine also.” ﻿ Indeed﻿, vaccine manufacturers are working on a new version of the coronavirus vaccine for 2024-2025 that targets the variants of the virus currently circulating and causing a significant share of infections in the U.S. The updated vaccines are expected in early fall — around the same time the annual flu shot becomes available. The COVID-19 vaccine currently available in pharmacies and clinics targets a coronavirus variant that is no longer circulating widely. Nevertheless, the vaccine “still looks pretty good in protecting against severe disease,” even when up against the newer variants, Schaffner says. “Fortunately, these variants are all part of the omicron family,” he adds, meaning they share similar traits. Omicron burst onto the scene in late 2021, and its descendants have been circulating ever since. Wondering if it’s better to go ahead and get a shot now or wait until fall? Talk to your doctor, who can help you weigh your personal risks. You should also talk to your doctor if you are under 65 and worried about complications from COVID. ﻿ All about coronavirus COVID’s summer wave Summer cold or COVID? Isolation guidelines change Members only: COVID 4 times Eligible for a booster shot? Medicare coverage details Masks are still ‘front line’ prevention tools Another tool that adds an additional layer of protection during the summer swell is a face mask, Schaffner says. Masks act as a filter “to reduce the number of germs you breathe in or out,” the CDC explains, lowering the risk of virus transmission. N95 and KN95 respirators tend to do the best job at blocking viruses like the coronavirus, says the CDC. You can find these masks for sale at many retail pharmacies. “The front line of prevention is still handwashing and masks,” says Jill Foster, M.D., assistant dean and a professor in the division of pediatric infectious diseases at University of Minnesota Medical Center. Feeling sick? Take a test If you do come down with symptoms — and Foster says she’s seeing many COVID infections this summer start out like a head cold — it’s important to test yourself for COVID-19, especially if you’re in a high-risk group. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. The reason: If the test is positive, you’ll want to reach out to your health care provider right away to ask about treatments. You can take one of two prescription antiviral medications — Paxlovid being the preferred — at home to help keep a mild infection from turning severe. And they work best when started right away. Better yet, Schaffner says, talk to your doctor even if you aren’t sick to get a plan in place, should you catch COVID this summer. “It would be wise for everybody in the high﻿-risk group to have had a conversation with their provider such that if they do become positive, how can they quickly get a Paxlovid prescription? What would happen on a weekend, for example, or if the provider is on vacation? Just have that conversation so that, should you turn positive, [you’ll be able] to start your Paxlovid just as quickly as you can,” Schaffner says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/weight-loss-medication-side-effects/,"What Are the Side Effects of New Weight Loss Medications? Here’s a look at common reactions to GLP-1 drugs like Mounjaro, Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound​ By Rachel Nania, Updated January 31, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published January 17, 2024 / Updated January 31, 2025 George Frey/Bloomberg via Getty Images It’s hard to turn on the TV, read the news or make it through a conversation without hearing about Ozempic and other drugs like it that belong to a class of medications known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s. These drugs — some federally approved for diabetes, some approved for weight management, along with a few other health conditions — have shot to superstar status for their weight loss effects. In some cases, they’ve helped people shed about 20 percent of their body weight. Plus, research shows they can help prevent heart problems, lower the risk of worsening kidney disease, and aid sleep apnea – all health issues that can become more common with age. It’s no wonder that demand for them is through the roof. A December 2023 poll from the University of Michigan found that more than 60 percent of overweight adults ages 50 to 80 are interested in taking one. “These are game-changing medications,” says Shauna Levy, M.D., an obesity medicine physician at the Tulane University Medical Center in New Orleans and the medical director of Tulane’s Bariatric and Weight Loss Center. But like any drug, they are not without possible side effects. Read on to learn more about the common — and rare — side effects of these newer weight loss medications. Side effects of weight loss drugs Four of the more popular GLP-1 medications — Ozempic and Mounjaro (approved for diabetes) and Wegovy and Zepbound (approved for weight loss, plus a few other conditions) — have similar side effects. The most common GLP-1 side effects include: NauseaDiarrheaVomitingConstipationStomach pain A study from researchers at Mayo Clinic, presented in 2023, found that half of adults taking semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, experienced side effects, the most reported ones being nausea (38 percent) and diarrhea (9 percent). The side effects experienced were mostly mild and did not affect quality of life, the researchers found. However, more serious issues have also been linked to these drugs, including gallbladder problems, low blood sugar, kidney injury and diabetic retinopathy (damage to the eye’s retina). A study published in 2023 in the medical journal JAMA found that people who take these medications may be at an increased risk for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and gastroparesis, sometimes called stomach paralysis because the stomach can’t empty. Individuals have reported hair loss when taking these drugs, as well as aspiration (when food or liquid enters the airway) when sedated for surgery, likely due to the delay in stomach emptying caused by the drugs. Interestingly, new research published in the journal Nature Medicine evaluated the health outcomes of more than 2 million veterans with diabetes taking a GLP-1 and found that while the medications had positive effects on several health conditions, like heart disease and substance use disorders, they were negatively associated with some, including arthritis. An increased risk of arthritis was not expected, says study co-author Ziyad Al-Aly, M.D., director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and chief of the Research and Education Service at the VA St. Louis Health Care System, since weight loss is generally considered beneficial for people with arthritis — especially if pain is in weight-bearing joints, like the hips and knees. However, Al-Aly says when people — and particularly older adults — lose weight, “they don't only lose fat; they actually lose muscle mass and bone mass,” which could help explain the association. Both bone loss and muscle loss are linked to joint problems, research shows. The study also found that adults taking a GLP-1 had an increased risk for interstitial nephritis, a type of kidney condition that Al-Aly says is “almost like an allergic reaction that the kidney mounts against certain drugs.” He says more long-term studies are needed to better understand the risks and benefits of prolonged use. Weigh the risks of side effects Despite reports of some serious side effects, Levy says these medications have a pretty solid safety record. (Some GLP-1 agonists have been around for nearly two decades.) A lot of people who experience the common side effects tend to feel better as they continue on the medications, not worse. Plus, intermittent treatments can bring relief. For example, an over-the-counter laxative like MiraLAX can help with constipation, Levy says. Some of the side effects may not be a result of the drug but the weight loss itself — Levy says hair loss is “incredibly common” in people who lose a lot of weight — or they could be due to an underlying disease. Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved for diabetes, which is the most common known cause of gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. In some studies, it affects up to half of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These diabetes and weight loss medications are not for everyone. People who have a history of pancreatitis should discuss the risks with their doctor before starting the drugs. Chetna Bakshi, M.D., a bariatric surgeon at Northwell Health’s Syosset Hospital in New York, says patients who have medullary thyroid cancer or a family history of it should not take them, because of the potential risk of thyroid C-cell tumors. Talk to your doctor Bottom line: Have a conversation with your health care provider before starting these medications. “Side effects are always important to know, and [patients should] understand that there’s no miracle drug,” Bakshi says. “Everything comes with a risk; everything comes with complications.” Reports of aspiration underline the need for medical supervision while taking the medications, Levy says. The American Society of Anesthesiologists suggests withholding GLP-1 medications before elective surgery to reduce the risk of complications, and this is something your doctor can help with, should you have an upcoming operation. Some people take these medications without ever making a trip to see their doctor, new reports show. In 2023, the FDA warned consumers that semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, was being illegally marketed online. The agency warned that “these drugs may be counterfeit, which means they could contain the wrong ingredients, contain too little, too much or no active ingredient at all, or contain other harmful ingredients.” “It could certainly lead to complications if patients are not being screened properly and counseled properly,” Levy says. “So I think that’s the big takeaway.” Editor's note: This story, originally published Jan. 17, 2024, has been updated to reflect new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/avoiding-cognitive-decline/,"Memory Loss Often Caused by More General and Reversible Health Issues From medications to sleep, find out what can contribute to cognitive decline AJ Watt/getty images By: Barbara Sadick En español Published February 19, 2020 Suspect your memory isn't what it used to be? You could be right. But the reasons for your cognitive slump might not be the ones you worry about. “Slow cognitive decline is expected as we get older,” says Joel Salinas, a neurologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Neurology Henry and Allison McCance Center for Brain Health. What's not considered a normal or expected part of aging, he says, is dementia — a disease signaled by “more rapid decline in cognitive abilities.” Many older adults worry about big causes, such as Alzheimer's, without realizing that, “in fact, many cognitive issues signal more general health problems such as thyroid issues, dehydration or lifestyle issues that can be reversed,” Salinas notes. Low thyroid functioning, he says, can be experienced as ongoing fatigue and slowed thinking. Too much alcohol can impair memory, and dehydration — often simply not drinking enough water throughout the day — causes too little blood flow to the brain. Getting at the bottom of what's affecting your ability to reason, remember or articulate your thoughts is important. To that end, Donna de Levante Raphael, director of the Alzheimer's Foundation of America National Memory Screening Program, says a memory screening, covered by Medicare, should be part of your annual wellness visit. You might find out that your cognitive issues are caused by one of the below factors — and can often be reversed. Medications As we age, we tend to add a variety of medications to our daily intake — along with risks of adverse health effects from both individual drugs and the overall mix. One of the most common Rx side effects: cognitive impairment. Tatyana Gurvich, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, says that when older adults mention memory problems, the first thing she does is look at the medications they're taking. Some over-the-counter medications such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), which can create confusion, can be purchased under brand names consumers don't recognize or hidden in combination products like Advil PM. Medications for overactive bladder or incontinence and those for depression or sleep can, in various combinations, also cause cognitive impairment. Combining any with opioids can make an older adult more confused. “Unfortunately, older adults often take a cocktail of medicines — both over-the-counter and prescription — that can cause major changes in cognition,” says Gurvich, who encourages older adults to talk to their doctor or pharmacist about all the drugs they're taking before making any changes. Lack of exercise Numerous studies show that exercise protects memory and thinking skills. One from the University of British Columbia found that regular aerobic exercise such as running or brisk walking boosts the size of the hippocampus, which stimulates the release of chemicals in the brain that affect the health and supply of brain cells. There's a negative effect, too, for those who aren't active: “Not walking or doing other aerobic exercise on a regular basis can cause brain shrinkage and lead to an increase of white matter changes or small injuries to the parts of brain cells that connect with other brain cells,” says Mary Ellen Quiceno, a neurologist and researcher in Dallas. In good news, the positive effects of exercise on the brain appear to be immediate. A University of Maryland study of brain health in older adults shows that just one session of exercise increases activation in the brain circuits associated with memory. In people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment as well as in cognitively healthy older adults, verbal fluency and measures of brain function improve after just 12 weeks of exercise, says J. Carson Smith, associate professor of kinesiology at Maryland's School of Public Health. “Being physically active helps protect the brain from cognitive decline and atrophy. Those who are at increased risk through their genetics and don't exercise tend to have the most problems,” he says, adding that everyone should walk or do other moderately intensive exercise for 30 minutes at least four days a week. Sleep issues ""Too much sleep or too little high-quality sleep can cause a problem with memory, reasoning and particularly executive function,” Salinas says. As he explains it, during deeper stages of sleep, the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for the formation and retrieval of memories, transfers newly made memories to the prefrontal cortex, a brain area responsible for long-term storage. Without enough shut-eye, this process is disrupted — with sometimes noticeable results. A University of California Berkeley study found that older people who sleep poorly experience memory loss and brain disorientation. Researchers at Michigan State University's Sleep and Learning Lab recently found that sleep deprivation doubles your odds of being unable to complete a series of steps without losing your place and triples the number of lapses in attention. “Our findings debunk a common theory suggesting that attention is the only cognitive function affected by sleep deprivation,” says Michelle Stepan, one of the study's researchers. Anxiety and depression If you're feeling mentally fuzzy, depression or anxiety could be playing a major role. Depression, which the National Institute on Aging says is common in older adults, who tend to be more isolated, can also mimic the signs of memory loss. “When you're depressed, the serotonin levels in your brain decrease and this can affect attention, processing speed and memory consolidation, causing a ‘pseudodementia’ of depression,” says neurologist Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Research shows that depression and anxiety can also alter our brain physically. A study from Brigham Young University, for instance, shows that subjects with anxiety and depression showed less brain cell growth in key in areas compared with those not dealing with such mood disorders.","The article explores the common concern of memory loss in older adults, questioning the assumption that it is always a sign of dementia or Alzheimer's. Key findings suggest that reversible health issues, such as medication side effects, lack of exercise, sleep problems, dehydration, and anxiety or depression, are often the underlying causes of cognitive decline. Notably, the article highlights that simple changes, like reviewing medications, exercising regularly, and improving sleep quality, can significantly improve cognitive function. A surprising insight is that even a single session of exercise can have an immediate positive effect on brain function.",101
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/sneaky-diabetes-symptoms/,"12 Sneaky Signs of Diabetes Symptoms from mood swings to vision problems to skin tags can signal diabetes By Michelle Crouch, Updated November 26, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published April 04, 2022 / Updated November 26, 2024 Tom Werner / Getty Images Many Americans are familiar with the hallmark symptoms of type 2 diabetes, such as increased thirst and frequent urination. But doctors say there are several lesser-known signs of the disease, and they sometimes emerge before the typical symptoms. Becoming familiar with those subtler signs can help you catch the disease early. That’s important because the earlier diabetes is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat and manage, says Mandeep Bajaj, M.D., a professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and chief of endocrinology at Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center in Houston. More than 38 million adults in the United States have diabetes, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Remarkably, 8.7 million (or nearly 23 percent) don’t know they have it, the CDC says. What’s more, about 98 million U.S. adults have prediabetes, in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes. About 8 in 10 of them don’t know they have it. “All of these undiagnosed people walking around with diabetes are at greater risk of complications,” such as chronic kidney disease, heart disease and stroke, as well as nerve, vision and hearing problems, Bajaj says. Research has also linked uncontrolled diabetes with cognitive decline. Controlling your blood sugar through lifestyle changes, medications or insulin injections can delay or prevent those problems. A primary care physician can diagnose diabetes with a simple blood test. National guidelines call for patients over age 45 to be screened for type 2 diabetes at least every three years, but experts say you should ask your doctor to test you sooner if you have any signs or symptoms or are at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes. In addition to excessive thirst and frequent urination, here are some other indicators of diabetes or prediabetes: 1. Chronic yeast infections High blood sugar from diabetes impairs the immune system, making it harder for your body to fight off infections. Chronic vaginal yeast infections are particularly common in women with untreated diabetes because the extra sugar in their blood encourages yeast to grow, says Mark Guido, M.D., an endocrinologist with Novant Health Forsyth Endocrine Consultants in Winston Salem, North Carolina. Other types of recurrent infections — such as skin, bladder and urinary tract infections — can indicate diabetes. Bajaj says primary care doctors don’t always think about the link between chronic infections and diabetes. If you have repeat infections, he recommends that you ask to be screened. 2. Blurred vision If it seems like you need frequent updates to your eyeglass prescription, you may want to get tested for diabetes. When your blood sugar levels change quickly, it can cause the lens of your eyes to get cloudy or swell, creating blurry vision. “People think they need to change their glasses, but actually it may be a sign of diabetes,” Bajaj says. If left untreated, diabetes damages blood vessels in the back of the eye and can cause cataracts, glaucoma and blindness. 3. Sexual dysfunction Erectile dysfunction — when a man can no longer have or keep an erection — is common in men with diabetes. A 2017 systematic meta-analysis found that about 66 percent of men with type 2 diabetes experienced performance issues, and men with diabetes are about 3.5 times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction compared to men without the disease. Other studies show that men and women with poorly managed diabetes report a lower sex drive. Researchers say inflammation caused by diabetes may affect the part of the brain that controls sexual desire, according to the American Diabetes Association. Low levels of testosterone may also play a role. 4. Nausea or constipation High blood sugar can slow the digestive process, making you feel nauseated, constipated or sick to your stomach, Bajaj says. “You think you have stomach flu, go to the doctor, get some labs, and it turns out your glucose is super high,” Bajaj says. A typical gastrointestinal illness usually lasts no more than two or three days. If you have nausea, constipation or vomiting that lasts longer, something else is probably causing the problem, Bajaj says, and a diabetes screen should be part of the doctor’s workup. 5. A cut that is slow to heal If you get a cut or scrape that seems to take forever to heal, diabetes may be the culprit. The extra sugar in your blood when you’re diabetic slows wound healing, leaving you vulnerable to infection, Guido says. For that reason, surgeons often require patients to undergo diabetes testing before they have surgery, and that can lead to a diabetes diagnosis, Guido says. “It’s not uncommon for an older adult who needs knee surgery to end up finding out they have diabetes through the pre-op screening,” he says. 6. Mood changes If you find you’re more irritable, or your family complains about your mood swings, that can be another indicator of diabetes. Diabetes causes fatigue, which can increase moodiness. Bajaj recalls the case of a patient whose diabetes was detected after he was referred to human resources at work because of his irritability and impatience with colleagues. “High glucose affects the brain,” Bajaj says. “Someone with undiagnosed diabetes can’t control their emotions. The interesting thing is, once it’s treated and glucose is controlled, these symptoms improve.” 7. Unexplained weight loss Losing weight is usually a good thing. However, if you’ve lost a significant amount of weight without making any changes to your diet or fitness routine, diabetes could be the culprit. When you have diabetes, the sugar your body needs for fuel leaves your body in your urine, so your body begins burning fat and muscle for energy, Guido explains. That can result in quick and dramatic weight loss. “I have patients come and say, ‘I’ve lost 10 pounds in the last four to six weeks and I’m not on a diet,’” Bajaj says. 8. Dark patches of skin Diabetes can cause the skin in the creases around your neck, armpits or groin to get dark and leathery, Guido says. “It looks like your neck is kind of covered with soot, but it doesn’t wash off,” he says. Called acanthosis nigricans, those dark patches on your skin are a sign of insulin resistance, Guido says, and they can be an early sign of diabetes. 9. Excess facial hair or acne Some women with insulin resistance develop thick, coarse hair on their faces because insulin can stimulate cells to produce the male hormones that cause hair growth, Guido says. Those same hormones can cause acne. The good news, Guido says, is that those symptoms tend to resolve once you get glucose levels under control. 10. Skin tags Another signal that you may have early diabetes is the development of skin tags, fleshy growths often found on the neck, eyelids, armpits and groin. Although skin tags are generally harmless, many studies have found an increased risk of diabetes in those who have skin tags. A March 2020 study published in the journal BMC Research Notes found that 59 percent of those with skin tags had diabetes, compared with 13 percent of those without skin tags. Researchers aren’t entirely clear about the mechanism by which diabetes causes skin tags, but they suspect high levels of insulin are to blame. “Insulin resistance sets off growth factors that causes things to grow and change,” Guido says.﻿ 11. Tingling in the hands and feet Video: Early Signs of Type 2 Diabetes Numbness or a “pins and needles” feeling in the hands and feet could signal diabetes. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), high blood sugar can damage the body's nerves over time, leading to these symptoms. NIDDK estimates that half of people with diabetes experience this complication, known as peripheral neuropathy. 12. Itchy skin Itchy skin can be caused by a number of triggers, and diabetes is one of them. According to the CDC, too much sugar in the blood causes the body to pull fluid from its cells, which can dry out the skin. With diabetes, you may notice your lower legs are the itchiest areas, due to poor circulation, the American Diabetes Association says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/salt-substitutes/,"7 Salt Substitutes and How to Use Them Salt adds flavor, but most of us use too much. Here are several salt alternatives that won’t compromise taste By Lauren Bedosky, AARP Comments En español Published April 09, 2025 Levi Brown/Trunk Archive A dash of table salt to liven up a bland dish here and there may not seem like a big deal, but you’re probably getting more salt than you think. While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, most Americans are getting 3,400 mg a day on average. “Salt adds flavor to food, but eating too much of it can lead to some health issues,” says Laura M. Ali, a culinary nutritionist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Research shows that a high-salt diet is linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure (hypertension), which raises your risk of heart disease and stroke. “Cutting back on salt is a simple, effective way to lower those risks and protect your health,” Ali says. But limiting the salt in your diet doesn’t mean eating bland, flavorless foods. More and more people are turning to salt alternatives to improve their health without sacrificing taste. One 2024 study of adults ages 55 and older with normal blood pressure found those who replaced salt with a substitute were 40 percent less likely to develop hypertension over two years than those who kept using salt. Many salt substitutes on the market can turn basic dishes into culinary gems — little to no salt required. Here are several expert-recommended swaps for table salt. 1. Salt substitutes made with potassium chloride If you love the taste of salt and aren’t ready to kick it to the curb, try a low-sodium or sodium-free salt substitute like Nu-Salt, Morton Salt Substitute, McCormick’s NoSalt Original Sodium-Free Salt, or one of the Dash blends (formerly Mrs. Dash). Whereas table salt is made of sodium chloride, salt substitutes are products made entirely or partly of potassium chloride. Potassium chloride is a salt-like compound that tastes similar to sodium chloride. But, unlike sodium chloride, potassium chloride is beneficial for blood pressure. “Potassium is a mineral known for its ability to help lower blood pressure, but most Americans fall short of getting enough in their diets,” Ali says. “Potassium chloride salt substitutes can be a helpful choice for cutting down on sodium while boosting potassium intake — both of which can support healthier blood pressure in people with hypertension.” Replace traditional salt with a substitute made from potassium chloride and use it anytime you normally use salt, “like adding a little to a dish after it’s been cooked,” says Melissa Ann Prest, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The drawback of potassium chloride salt substitutes is that they can have a bitter or metallic flavor. Because of this, some prefer to use half potassium chloride salt substitute and half table salt, Ali notes. Getty Images 2. Lemon Citrus fruits like lemons are a source of acid, which mimics the role of salt when added to dishes. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice adds a bright flavor and brings out the other flavors in food, Ali says. “Squeezing a lemon over roasted broccoli or sauteed spinach is a delicious way to brighten up the vegetables and reduce their bitterness,” she continues. You can also add lemon zest to other spices to make a rub for meat or give a quick squeeze of lemon over chicken noodle soup or fish right before serving. 3. Vinegar “Just as lemon juice brightens a dish, the acid in vinegar has a similar effect,” Ali says. While there are many types of vinegar, balsamic vinegar or apple cider vinegar tend to work best. Both have a rich, sweetly tart flavor that compliments many different dishes. “A splash of vinegar over roasted vegetables brightens their flavor and helps reduce some of the bitterness, especially in cruciferous veggies,” Ali says. “I love tossing roasted Brussels sprouts with balsamic vinegar right before serving,” she adds. Getty Images 4. Rosemary This bold herb has a piney, slightly peppery flavor. It’s delicious on roasted meats, vegetables, beans, and soups or stews, Ali says. Rosemary is tough and can withstand heat, making it a great choice to season foods while they are cooking, she adds. “My favorite ways to use rosemary are to toss it with potato wedges and olive oil before roasting, and I love to add a sprig of fresh rosemary to a pot of beans while they cook, allowing the flavor to infuse into the beans,” Ali says. 5. Basil “Basil is another herb that can brighten up and bring out the flavors of a dish,” Ali says. It has a sweet, peppery taste that works well in tomato sauces, sandwiches, soups, stews, and more. “There is nothing better than chopped fresh basil on top of pizza, pasta, or an omelet,” Ali notes. Fresh basil can also brighten up fruit. Ali suggests tossing it with fresh watermelon or mixing it with strawberries for a flavorful twist. Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images 6. Black Pepper There’s a reason black pepper is the companion of table salt. “Black pepper contains a chemical called capsaicin that causes a mild irritation and makes your taste buds a bit more sensitive to salty flavors,” Ali says. Adding a sprinkle of black pepper to your food can help you cut back or even nix table salt entirely. As a bonus, black pepper is a versatile spice that can enhance almost any food with its mild, spicy flavor, Ali says. She suggests seasoning meat or poultry with black pepper before cooking to help infuse the dish with flavor during cooking. Black pepper is also a great choice for adding a bit of a kick to steamed vegetables after cooking and boosts the flavor of sauces, salad dressings, soups, and stews, Ali notes. 7. Fresh Garlic This root vegetable offers a pungent, spicy flavor when raw but transitions into sweet, buttery when cooked. Thanks to its strong presence, garlic can boost the flavor of many dishes without the help of table salt. “Fresh garlic can be used in many different ways, from sautéing to roasting, and adds a ton of flavor,” Prest notes. Incorporate garlic into sauces, soups, and stews, or add to pizza, pasta, steak, and potatoes.

This phenomenon, known as long COVID, has puzzled experts since near the start of the pandemic. And while research is starting to shore up some answers, Greg Vanichkachorn, M.D., formerly with Mayo Clinic, says, “we don’t really have [long COVID] nailed down yet.” A new definition for long COVID On June 11, 2024, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a new, universal definition for long COVID. The group defines long COVID as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” A big reason is because “it looks like more and more symptoms can be associated with this condition,” says Vanichkachorn, an occupational and aerospace medicine specialist who was the medical director of Mayo Clinic’s COVID Activity Rehabilitation Program and is now a physician with Delta Air Lines. In fact, the list of the most commonly reported long COVID symptoms maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes nearly 20, ranging from neurological complications to digestive disorders. Some studies have uncovered more than 50 long-term effects of COVID-19, adding issues such as hair loss and vision loss to the mix. Others estimate that number is much higher — closer to 200. Still, some symptoms seem to be more prevalent. A study published May 25, 2023, in the journal JAMA identified 12 symptoms that most set apart people with and without long COVID. They are: Post-exertional malaise, or the worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion — even minor effort. Fatigue. Brain fog.Dizziness.Gastrointestinal symptoms. Heart palpitations.Issues with sexual desire or capacity.Loss of smell or taste.Thirst.Chronic cough.Chest pain.Abnormal movements. New research from AARP reflects similar findings, with older adults reporting that their most common long COVID symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, cough, and loss of taste or smell. Results from the survey, published Feb. 6, 2024, show that nearly 1 in 5 adults ages 50 and older have experienced long COVID. Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID A new definition for long COVID On June 11, 2024, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a new, universal definition for long COVID. The group defines long COVID as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID Symptoms can be life altering The symptoms, however, are only “half the picture,” Vanichkachorn says. “The other half is how those symptoms really have changed a person’s ability to live their normal lives.” A handful of viruses can cause prolonged illness (experts call this post-acute sequelae), and recovery can be especially difficult for people who required hospitalization or intensive care. But what’s different about long COVID is that it seems to be more widespread, and the symptoms that people experience, even when they no longer test positive for coronavirus, seem to be more robust, Vanichkachorn says. “We’ve had patients complain of fatigue after a viral infection before … but patients after coronavirus infection, they really have some profound fatigue.” For some, this means routine tasks such as getting dressed or taking a shower require assistance. Others have trouble completing everyday errands like grocery shopping or doing the laundry due to their symptoms — “and of course, going to work,” Vanichkachorn adds. Among adults 50 and older living with long COVID, 21 percent say it has had a major impact on their physical health;﻿ 18 percent say it has affected their mental health. Twenty percent of older adults surveyed by AARP say long COVID has impacted their social life. Priya Duggal, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, estimates that 3 to 5 percent of people who have had COVID-19 “feel they cannot function normally in everyday life” due to lasting symptoms. Some people may be at higher risk A few folks may be more at risk for long COVID than others, though Duggal emphasizes that “no one gets a free pass.” People who had underlying health conditions before their coronavirus infection may be more likely to develop long COVID, the CDC says. Research also finds that more women report long COVID symptoms than men, and it tends to be more prevalent in middle-aged adults. According to the CDC, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to get long COVID than people who received the vaccine. And research, while still ongoing, has also shown that people who treat COVID-19 with an antiviral like Paxlovid are less likely to experience lingering symptoms. “When you’re vaccinated or when you treat yourself early on, the burden of virus is much less, and, therefore, I think you are less likely to go on to develop these longer-term symptoms,” says Paul Offit, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and author of the book Tell Me When It’s Over: An Insider’s Guide to Deciphering COVID Myths and Navigating our Post-Pandemic World. “So I think anything that decreases viral replication — whether it’s vaccination or whether it is early treatment — is a value.” Talk to your doctor early if you experience symptoms Lots of questions surrounding long COVID are still unanswered, but one thing is certain: Experts say if you had COVID-19 and notice any new or prolonged symptoms three or four weeks out from your infection, talk to your primary care physician. Don’t wait months before calling for an appointment, Vanichkachorn says. If you don’t have a primary care provider, seek care from an internist, Duggal adds. There isn’t a one-size-fits all treatment for long COVID, Offit says, and that’s because there likely isn’t just one cause. Right now, a lot of it comes down to managing individual symptoms and providing supportive care, and Vanichkachorn says the earlier you start that treatment, the better. AARP research, however, found that less than half of the adults surveyed saw their health care provider to address their ongoing COVID-related symptoms. It’s also important for people with chronic health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes to reach out to their doctor if they notice a change in their numbers after recovering from COVID-19, says Sabyasachi Sen, M.D., professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. It could signal a long-term effect from the infection. The CDC has tips for patients on how to plan for an appointment to discuss long COVID. The agency recommends preparing a list of your current and past medical conditions in advance, and writing down your experience with COVID-19 and any new or lingering conditions. Be sure to include: When they started.How they affect your life.How often they occur.What makes them worse. Finally, bring a list of your current medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to your appointment, and ask questions when you have them. ﻿ Editor’s Note: This story, first published on May 19, 2022, has been updated with new information.

But pretty soon, these same people may need only one poke instead of two for the same protection. Vaccine manufacturers are racing to develop a combination vaccine for influenza and COVID-19, and one maker says its version could be available as early as 2025. In a late-stage clinical trial with thousands of study participants ages 50 and older, individuals who received a combined coronavirus-influenza shot from Moderna generated a better immune response against flu and COVID-19 than participants who received the individual vaccines. What’s more, the side effects of the hybrid jab experienced during the phase 3 trial were nothing new, with the most common reactions being injection site pain, fatigue, muscle pain and headache. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Pfizer-BioNTech is also working on a combination vaccine, though the team recently faced a setback when the experimental inoculation failed to meet one of the main goals of a phase 3﻿ clinical trial. In a news release, Pfizer said “the companies are evaluating adjustments to the candidate and will discuss next steps with health authorities.” Similarly, Novavax, another COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer, has a combination COVID-flu vaccine that just wrapped phase 2 clinical trials. Further research is currently on hold to investigate ﻿""a spontaneous report of a serious adverse event of motor neuropathy"" in a trial participant, Novavax said in an Oct. 16 news release. The company said it does not believe the condition was caused by the vaccine, and that it hopes to resolve the matter and begin the phase 3 trial ""as soon as possible."" Single shot could boost vaccination rates Plenty of people have received their flu and COVID vaccines at the same time — some even in the same arm. Still, health experts are hopeful that combining the two into a single shot will increase the number of people who get vaccinated against both illnesses. “A lot of times, people just don’t want to get two pokes at the same time, so they schedule one [vaccine] now and then have the intention to come back in a few weeks and get the second one. And then what happens, if they never get the second one, they just go without that vaccine,” says Ann Philbrick, a pharmacist and associate professor and director of community engagement in the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy. A two-in-one shot “might help with completion of getting both of the vaccines,” she adds. William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, says one jab instead of two may also appeal to more people and could potentially boost the number of individuals getting vaccinated. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Vaccination rates have been declining in recent years, national data shows. About 23 percent of adults in the U.S. received last year’s coronavirus vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and less than half of adults got a flu shot last year. A new report from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases finds that only 38 percent of U.S. adults say they definitely plan to get a flu shot this year, and 26 percent plan to get the updated COVID vaccine. Plus, Schaffner says, combining the two vaccines just makes a lot of sense. Both viruses are especially active in the fall and winter months, and the recommendations “are identical for the two vaccines,” he explains. The CDC says most people ages 6 months and older should receive a flu shot and an updated COVID vaccine this fall. Side effects should be similar If a blend of two different vaccines sounds strange, know that it’s “very common to put more than one vaccine in a shot,” Philbrick says. Several vaccines given to young children are combination vaccines; a few examples include the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. Squeezing two vaccines into one shouldn’t double the side effects or cause any new reactions. “Many people have already elected to get both shots at the same time [in the same or different arm],” Schaffner says. “And there’s no evidence that there is a notable increase in adverse reactions, and these early trials by Moderna don’t indicate that there is any concern in that regard.” Get both standalone vaccines this year Schaffner says Moderna’s results, while not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, “[makes us] optimistic that the vaccine will be at least as good as our current vaccines, and maybe even better.” But until a combination COVID-flu vaccine is approved and available ﻿— Moderna says it expects to start the federal approval process in 2024 — it’s crucial to get the two separate shots this fall. “We know that there’s going to be a big outbreak of flu. We know that there’s going to be a big outbreak of COVID. How big? We don’t know, but there will be an outbreak of each and these viruses bring many people into the hospital, and obviously, as a consequence, cause many deaths. We want to protect as many people as possible this winter,” Schaffner says. Also: Adults 75 and older who didn’t get the RSV vaccine last year should plan to get it this year, health officials say. It’s recommended that adults ages 60–74 with underlying health conditions like heart and lung disease get the RSV vaccine, as well.

Meaning: Don’t accept blurriness, spots, flashes or floaters — get yourself checked out. How often should you get your eyes checked after 50? Recommendations for the frequency of eye exams for older adults vary slightly and are dependent on your age, overall health and risk factors for eye disease: The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults get a complete eye examination at age 40 (earlier if you have an eye disease or risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or family history of eye disease). After that exam, your eye care provider can tell you how often you should have your eyes checked in the future. If you are 65 or older, you should get your eyes checked every year or two, the group says.The American Optometric Association recommends people at low risk for eye problems get exams at least every two years for ages 40-64 and annually at 65 and older.The National Institute on Aging has slightly different recommendations, advising that everyone over age 50 have an eye exam annually, or as recommended by their eye care provider, and every year or two after age 60. The right interval for you depends on whether you have other health conditions, such as diabetes, so talk to your eye doctor about the schedule you should follow. More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health Here are nine reasons to make eye checkups a priority: 1. There’s more to your eye than meets the eye With dilation, drops added to the eye widen the pupil, allowing your doctor to view the inside of the eye — including the retina, lens and optic nerve — and look for age-related macular degeneration, melanomas and glaucoma. “Examining an undilated eye is like looking through a keyhole into a room. Dilation opens the door completely, so you can see all the corners of the room,” says optometrist Laura Di Meglio, an assistant professor at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. Dilation is usually included in the price of your eye exam. For an extra fee, though, some private practices offer testing on newer retinal-imaging devices. “These machines capture a wide view of the retina, even with undilated eyes,” Di Meglio says. The wider view of the retina allows the doctor to see the sides of the eyeballs and detect abnormalities that may otherwise be missed with standard testing. 2. Eyes are a window into your health “The eye is the only place in the body where you can directly visualize nerves and blood vessels,” Wisner explains. Eye doctors scan your eye for conditions that affect blood vessels, including hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes — and can sometimes be the first to detect a problem. “Heart disease still remains one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality in our country, and if we pick up on it early enough, we can get on top of it and prevent damage,” he says. 3. A vision exam is brain-healthy, too What’s healthy for the eyes is healthy for the brain. Vision problems are associated with a higher risk of memory and thinking problems. In fact, older adults with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness had 72 percent higher odds of dementia compared to those without, according to a study in JAMA Ophthalmology. (Most types of untreated vision problems were associated with dementia.) Vision problems can be found — and addressed — at your eye doctor’s office. For example, you can get a prescription for glasses or be evaluated for cataract surgery. 4. You can stop switching glasses to read the paper Even if you don’t have a prescription for glasses, you still need an annual vision exam. Around age 40, people naturally begin to develop presbyopia, a condition in which the lens of the eye loses its ability to change shape and accommodate for different distances. “You can’t read things up close anymore, so you hold materials at an arm’s distance. But by age 55, most can’t struggle through it — their arm just isn’t long enough anymore,” Di Meglio says. Drugstore readers might suffice, but talk to your doctor about prescription readers or progressive lenses, which can improve depth perception. (Progressives take some getting used to, so inform your doctor if you’re at risk for falls.) 5. The latest contacts could change the way you see Use your yearly eye exam as an opportunity to discuss if there are contact lens options that can make your life easier. New materials can improve comfort and let contact lenses solve more than one vision issue at a time. For example, toric lenses can treat astigmatism, orthokeratology lenses help reshape the cornea to correct myopia (near-sightedness), and multifocal contacts combine multiple prescriptions in one lens. 6. You may be able to ditch wearing glasses forever Eye tests over 60 include screening for cataracts. A clouding of the lens of the eye, a cataract can develop so slowly that you may not notice the difference initially. For some, cataracts begin to grow in their 50s, or even at age 40. By age 80, more than half of Americans have had one. But cataract surgery can liberate some people from glasses altogether, Wisner says. The procedure is quick (one hour), downtime is short (no more than a few days), and new techniques mean that some people won’t need post-op eye drops. AARP/Shutterstock 7. You don’t need to drive with glare If night driving is becoming increasingly challenging, ask about antireflective lenses for your glasses, optometrist Barbara Horn suggests. “If your eyes are healthy with no or minimal cataracts, antireflective lenses are the most common solution,” she says. That said, for folks who are over age 75, nighttime driving almost doubles the risk of being injured in a traffic accident, research suggests. At an annual vision exam, your eye care provider can talk to you about ways to make driving at night — or during the day — safer and make sure you’re being treated for any eye-related diseases. 8. Those eye floaters could signal something bigger Regardless of how recently you’ve been to the eye doctor, you should also schedule a visit for an eye exam when something feels wrong with your vision. For example, with aging, the gel-like substance in the eyes, called the vitreous, begins to shrink; it may even separate from the retina, says Elena Roth, M.D., an ophthalmologist with the University of Miami Health System. One symptom of this might be seeing floaters and flashes in your vision. Most of the time you won’t need to be treated for floaters, but you will need to be closely followed by your doctor to watch for a retinal tear, a complication that can lead to vision loss. The good news is that those floaters usually stop bothering you eventually. “After three to six months, the brain learns to adjust and accommodate them,” Roth says. 9. If you have diabetes, see your eye doctor — it’s critical If you have diabetes, you have a 25-fold higher risk of developing blindness compared to the general population. Here’s where the importance of eye exams comes in: Most of that vision loss can be prevented when you see your ophthalmologist regularly to catch problems as they start. How often should you go to the eye doctor if you have diabetes? Every year. “Diabetes is a disease of blood vessels. In the eye, it causes bleeding and leakage of fluid in the retina, which can cause loss of vision,” Wisner says. That’s why an annual dilated exam is crucial. What’s going on in your eyes is a direct reflection of what’s happening in your kidneys, he adds; if a vision exam shows diabetes is not well controlled, you have an opportunity to take steps to preserve your eyesight — and the rest of your body.

And for a number of reasons, older adults are more likely to be affected by it. According to national statistics, nearly a quarter of U.S. adults ages 75 and older have heart disease, an umbrella term for a cluster of heart conditions, including coronary artery disease and heart failure. Roughly 14 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 and 9 percent of adults ages 55 to 64 have received a diagnosis. 7 types of heart disease Coronary artery disease — narrowing of your heart’s blood vessels because of fatty deposits Arrhythmias — abnormal heart rhythms Heart valve diseases Cardiomyopathy — abnormal heart muscle Heart failure — heart squeezing and relaxation difficulties Congenital heart disease — heart issues you have at birth Issues with the fluid-filled sac surrounding your heart (pericardium) Source: Cleveland Clinic “Heart disease is unfortunately prevalent,” says Steven Tabak, M.D., medical director of quality and physician outreach at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. “But we can really impact it” if we address its risk factors, he adds. Indeed, even as it becomes more common with age, heart disease is not inevitable. Doctors and researchers say there are several things individuals can do to lower their risk, and while it’s ideal to adopt these changes when you’re young, it’s never too late to start. Here are eight things you need to know about heart disease, including its risks, symptoms and how doctors help to treat it. 1. Leading heart disease risk factors are common among older adults A handful of habits and health conditions can increase a person’s risk of getting heart disease. Chief among them is high cholesterol, which can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, causing them to narrow. High cholesterol — defined as total cholesterol above 200 mg/dL — is most commonly diagnosed in people between ages 40 and 59, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The only way to know your numbers is to have your cholesterol checked with a blood test. High blood pressure, which affects an estimated 63 percent of adults ages 60 and older, is another big risk factor for heart disease. A blood pressure reading of 130–139 for the top number (known as the systolic pressure) and 80–89 for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) is considered high. Other heart disease risk factors include: Diabetes, which affects nearly one in three people ages 65 and olderPhysical inactivityExcess weightAn unhealthy dietAlcohol useSmoking While many heart disease risk factors are modifiable, some are not. In fact, about 50 percent of heart disease risk is genetically determined, according to a 2024 article in the journal Atherosclerosis, which is why knowing your family’s history with the disease is critical. Genetic testing for variants of the TNNT2 gene can help your doctor assess your risk for developing dangerous heart conditions and inform the playbook for your individual health care plan. Abha Khandelwal, M.D., a cardiologist with Stanford Health Care in California, says people who are more susceptible to heart disease can improve their outcomes with heart-healthy behaviors like exercise and controlling blood sugar and blood pressure. 7 types of heart disease Coronary artery disease — narrowing of your heart’s blood vessels because of fatty deposits Arrhythmias — abnormal heart rhythms Heart valve diseases Cardiomyopathy — abnormal heart muscle Heart failure — heart squeezing and relaxation difficulties Congenital heart disease — heart issues you have at birth Issues with the fluid-filled sac surrounding your heart (pericardium) Source: Cleveland Clinic 2. Heart disease can lead to dangerous — and deadly — complications Heart disease can lead to several complications affecting not only the heart but other parts of the body. These include: Arr﻿hythmia — a fast or abnormal heart rateCardiac arrest — when the heart stops beating suddenlyCardiomyopathy — a disease of the heart that makes it harder for the muscle to pump bloodHeart attackHeart failureHeart valve diseasePulmonary hypertension, high blood pressure in your arteries which starves your blood of oxygenKidney damageLiver damage 3. Its symptoms can be sneaky Often called the “silent killer,” heart disease can strike without warning: You might not know you have it until you have a heart attack, stroke or other sudden event. Each year, there are approximately 605,000 heart attacks in the U.S., and 170,000 of them occur without any major symptoms. “We think of heart disease as this sudden, crushing chest pain with an elephant sitting on your chest. And that can be the case for some people, but for a lot of other people, it can be unusual,” says Samuel Kim, M.D., director of preventive cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. According to the Mayo Clinic, common symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels can include shortness of breath, weakness or numbness in the arms and legs, and pain in the neck, jaw, upper back or upper belly. Symptoms of heart disease caused by irregular heartbeats can range from dizziness to shortness of breath to a racing heartbeat. 4. Women have unique risks Khandelwal says heart disease is often assumed to be a man’s disease, but it’s also the leading cause of death among women. In fact, it affects more than 60 million women in the U.S., according to the CDC. Several health issues unique to women play a role in heart disease risk, Khandelwal says, including gestational diabetes, preterm labor, preeclampsia and the years leading up to menopause (called perimenopause) when estrogen levels drop. Estrogen has a protective effect on the heart by increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also called the “good” cholesterol. When women go through menopause, the drop in estrogen puts them at risk for heart disease when HDL levels start to creep up. 5. Some diets are better than others for heart disease Not all diets are created equal when it comes to keeping heart disease in check. The American Heart Association ranks a few at the top, including the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet — a low-sodium plan full of fresh fruits and vegetables and very limited processed foods — and the Mediterranean diet, also rich in plants, fresh fish, legumes, nuts and olive oil. These and a plant-based diet get high marks for lowering the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure, according to a 2023 article published in the Vascular Health and Risk Management journal. The article cited several studies, including one that found that people who ate a diet full of fruits, veggies and legumes reduced their risk of early death by 19 percent. On the flip side, doctors and researchers say there are several foods to avoid if you are trying to lower heart disease risk or manage the condition. These include: Fatty meatsProcessed foodsTropical oils and partially hydrogenated fatsFoods high in sodiumFoods high in added sugar “In place of fatty meats, try leaner cuts of meat such as loin and round cuts, poultry without the skin, fish and seafood, and beans,” says Kelli Metzer, a registered dietitian at GW Medical Faculty Associates in Washington, D.C. “Grilling, baking or air frying are healthier cooking methods than frying in oil﻿,” she adds. 6. Sleep habits can affect your heart Getting fewer than seven hours of sleep a night can increase your risk of developing diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure — all of which influence heart disease risk, the CDC says. Tabak says getting into a regular sleep routine is key to catching more ZZ’s. “People who don’t have a regular time to go to bed or wake up, they’re just setting themselves up for sleep deprivation,” he says. Sleep apnea, a common sleep disorder, can also increase heart disease risk or worsen it if you already have it. If your partner complains of constant snoring, that could be one clue that it’s time to check with your doctor about sleep apnea. Other symptoms include waking up feeling short of breath and excess daytime sleepiness. 7. A little exercise can make a big difference in heart disease risk The CDC recommends you get moving — and a little can go a long way. Aim for 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise, like walking — that’s a 21-minute walk each day. You should also incorporate strength training two times per week. The key, Tabak says, is to “find something that you enjoy doing and will do regularly.” Studies have found that even gardening can lower the risk of heart disease in older adults. 8. Medications can be lifesavers There are several medications doctors prescribe to lower the risk of heart disease or help manage it. Some of them include: Ace inhibitors, which lower blood pressureAspirin, to prevent blood clotsBeta blockers, to lower blood pressure and force the heart to beat with less forceBlood thinnersCalcium channel blockers, to lower blood pressure and relax blood vesselsCholesterol-lowering medicationsDiuretics, to help get rid of sodiumVasodilators, to lower blood pressure by widening blood vessels for better blood flow For several years now, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists — or GLP-1s, like Ozempic and Wegovy — have helped people with diabetes and obesity lose weight and lower blood glucose levels. More recently, some have been federally approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in individuals who are overweight or have obesity. “I think they [GLP-1s] have a role in reducing heart disease,” Khandelwal, says, though she cautions they may have some drawbacks, especially for older adults. “There is some evidence that when we lose weight with some of these medications, we also risk losing skeletal muscle,” she explains. Lauren Evoy Davis is a contributing writer who has covered health and wellness for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in the National Council on Aging, Everyday Health, HealthCentral, Patient Power, WebMD and Verywell Health.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 clear sentences:

Check out our guide to the cost of shots for Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance and the uninsured By Rachel Nania, Updated September 09, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 13, 2023 / Updated September 09, 2024 Getty Images Newly updated vaccines that target more recent versions of the coronavirus are now available in pharmacies and clinics nationwide, and health officials are recommending that everyone age 6 months and older get one to reduce the likelihood of developing a severe case of COVID-19﻿. But for some people, getting the vaccine at no cost may come with more﻿ hurdles than in previous years. The Bridge Access Program, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched in 2023 to cover the cost of the COVID-19 vaccine for uninsured and underinsured individuals, has ended, leaving millions of adults without a safety net. While most U.S. adults age 65-plus get health insurance through Medicare, an estimated 457,000 people 65 or older are uninsured, according to a report from the health policy nonprofit KFF. What’s more, research published in 2020 found that almost 1 in 10, or about 6 million people, between the ages of 50 and 64 in the U.S. had no health insurance in 2018. So what can people without insurance do to avoid paying upwards of $200 out of pocket for a shot this season? “Be sure to be in touch with your public health department or a community health center,” CDC Director Mandy Cohen, M.D., said during a Sept. 5 AARP tele﻿-town﻿ hall. “We just released additional dollars in funding” — $62 million, according to Cohen — “so they could be able to purchase vaccines and offer them for free as well.” You can use the National Association of County & City Health Officials’ (NACCHO) health department directory to contact one in your area. AARP also has state-specific vaccine guides that can help you find a location near you to get a COVID-19 shot. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Even with these additional funds, however, it’s not enough to get shots into the arms of all the uninsured and underinsured, says Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of NACCHO. “The federal program is meant to provide some help, but a lot of these local health departments, particularly, simply don’t have the funding to continue to provide free vaccines on their own,” says Freeman, who explains that there are 3,300 health departments nationwide, “and they all do things a bit differently.” Some centers may be able to cobble together the necessary funding, Freeman adds, but the people who will be impacted most by this patchwork program are “always the most vulnerable.” “[They] are often the same ones that suffer from underlying health conditions, that are at higher risk, that don’t have normal access to a provider, perhaps, or services,” Freeman says. “And so it’s almost like a double insult to that group that’s already vulnerable, and you’re just sort of exacerbating the issue by not having vaccine readily available.” Freeman says those reaching out to their health department about the updated COVID-19 vaccine should ask if it’s available, what it costs and what’s required to get the shot. Additionally, COVID vaccine manufacturer Pfizer said that it will have a vaccine assistance program for people who cannot pay out of pocket for this year’s shot. The company told AARP that in the fall, eligible uninsured individuals 12 and older can access Pfizer’s vaccine either “at participating retail pharmacies through the Pfizer Retail Vax Assistance” or “at institutions participating in Pfizer’s Institutional Patient Assistance Program (IPAP).” Check PfizerRxPathways.com periodically for updated information, the company said in a statement. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Is a COVID vaccine free with insurance? If you do have health insurance, here’s what you can expect when you get a COVID vaccine this year. If you have Medicare. The vast majority of adults age 65-plus have health insurance through Medicare, and the COVID-19 vaccine is covered at no cost under Part B, which is the part of Medicare that pays for doctor’s visits and other outpatient services. (An annual flu shot and the pneumococcal vaccine are also covered under Part B; vaccines for RSV and shingles are available at no cost for people with a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.) If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan, be sure to stick with your plan’s in-network pharmacies and doctors to make sure the vaccine is administered at no cost. If you have private insurance. “Generally, all of our private insurers are covering [the COVID-19 vaccine] as well,” the CDC’s Cohen told AARP. Still, it’s a good idea to check with your plan. If you intend to get the vaccine at a pharmacy, make sure that the pharmacy is in your plan’s network. The same goes if you plan to get it at a doctor’s office — you’ll want to make sure your provider is in network to avoid the possibility of any out-of-pocket expenses. If you have Medicaid. The COVID-19 vaccine continues to be covered at no cost under the prescription drug law signed in 2022. The law requires state Medicaid programs to cover federally approved vaccines that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. ﻿ Do you really need the new COVID vaccine? Talk to your doctor if you have reservations, but for the vast majority of Americans, the answer is ﻿yes. Even if you had a COVID-19 vaccine last year, doctors and public health officials say you should get one again this year. “Particularly those over 65 — make sure you’re making a plan,” Cohen told AARP. The reason: Even though you may still have some immunity from previous vaccines and infections, immunity fades over time. And a vaccine that you got a year ago may not provide you today with enough protection from some of the more serious complications that can occur with COVID-19, says Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. Older adults are at greater risk of experiencing complications that could lead to hospitalization or even death. Hospitalization rates for people 65 and older continue to tower over the rates for younger populations, the latest CDC data shows, and many Americans are still losing their lives to COVID. Roughly 900 people are dying from COVID each week, according to federal data. Three updated COVID-19 vaccine options are available this year, including one from Moderna, one from Pfizer-BioNTech and one from Novavax. “They all provide protection against serious consequences of COVID. It’s just important to get a vaccine — get whatever one is easiest and most convenient for you,” Cohen said.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-presbyopia/,"Presbyopia Symptoms and Treatments What you need to know about age-related vision changes By Lauren Evoy Davis, AARP Comments En español Published May 08, 2025 Liam Eisenberg If you’re starting to hold restaurant menus further and further away to see better, you are likely experiencing presbyopia. It’s not a disease, but a natural sign of aging, like graying hair. Presbyopia, with Greek and Latin origins roughly meaning “old eye” is the medical term for your vision becoming less clear over time, affecting approximately 128 million people in the United States, according to the American Optometric Association (AOA). It typically starts when people are in their 40s, when they start notice they're having a harder time clearly seeing things close up. Just as muscles anywhere else in your body often become less flexible as you get older, this happens as the eye muscles become less flexible, says Vicky Wong, president of the American Optometric Association. Symptoms and conditions The main symptom of presbyopia is the inability to see things clearly up close. Other symptoms or conditions include: Blurry eyesDouble visionEye strainHeadachesTrouble focusing Those with diabetes, heart disease, or multiple sclerosis might have an earlier onset of presbyopia. Some medications, such as diuretics, antidepressants, and antihistamines, may also bring on premature presbyopia. Antidepressants can also cause dry eyes and blurred vision. In addition, menopause brings on changes and dryness of the eyes. Diagnosis At an eye appointment, the doctor will put drops in your eyes to dilate them. The doctor will perform and eye exam to determine if you have presbyopia or another eye condition. If you are between the ages of 55 and 64 you should have an eye examevery one to three years, according to AOA. After age 65, you should visit your eye doctor annually. Treatments If untreated, presbyopia can inhibit your quality of life, and there are many options to help correct your vision. Reading glasses It’s a good idea to schedule a yearly eye exam to understand both your vision changes and your overall eye health. Your eye doctor might recommend that you get reading glasses. But this doesn’t mean you need to buy an expensive pair. You may be able to simply buy readers, which increase the close-up fonts and images. If your eyes have very different prescriptions, however, you may need prescription glasses, but when considering cost, you don’t have to buy them from the storefront at your eye doctor. Instead, ask for your prescription so that you can use it online or at discount stores. Contact lenses Contact lenses can be a good option for people who don’t want to keep glasses on hand. Lens types include: Bifocal: The lens has a line between the up-close and distance prescriptionsDiffractive: The lens focuses light by diffraction, which is bending light to two focal pointsMonofocal: One lens corrects one eye for distance, and the other lens for up closeMultifocal: Also called simultaneous vision, this lens has prescriptions for both up close and distance, but without the distinctive line of bifocals. You can choose lenses that you change daily or once per month. Daily lenses cost between $20 to $40 for a 30-day pack. Costs for monthly lenses range from $40 to $120 for lenses, but you can get them at a discounted bulk rate at big box stores. Many vision insurance plans cover eye exams and contact lenses, but may not cover them in full. Eye drops In 2021 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vuity﻿, prescription eye drops to treat presbyopia. You use them once daily, you can expect to get six to eight hours of clearer vision, according to Wong. “I have some patients that will use it just on the weekends, when they're out and about. If they're running errands or going to a kid's game, so that they don't have to keep bringing around their glasses,” says Wong. The drops are a low dose of a medication that makes the pupils smaller and increases the focal range, similar to a camera’s aperture, a fancy word for “opening,” according to Lisa Park, an ophthalmologist and associate professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. However, Park says the drops are not without risks, including, in rare cases, retinal detachment. You can expect to pay between $80 and $100. Insurance companies do not generally cover eye drops. Types of surgery There are several surgical options available, which greatly depend on each person’s vision needs, according to Shahzad I. Mian, M.D., professor of ophthalmology and director of W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Cataract surgery Mian says surgery to correct cataracts, when an aging eye lens becomes cloudy and hinders vision, can also correct presbyopia. This involves removing the lens and replacing it with a plastic lens. It creates monovision, which means one eye is corrected for up close and the other eye is corrected for distance. It may take some time for your brain to adjust. “People who have cataracts also have issues with their reading vision as well, but cataracts tend to become functionally visually significant more when you're in your 60s or older, on average,” Mian says. LASIK LASIK, short for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, is another option. LASIK surgery involves an ultraviolet laser to reshape the curvature of the cornea, the clear covering of the eye that refracts light. This procedure is also very quick and can create multifocal, bifocal, or other types of vision corrections. Side effects can include temporary fuzzy vision, dry eye or a halo effect. Be proactive with your eye health “Don’t ignore eye strain,” says Wong. With more and more people working from small screens on laptops and their smartphones, eye strain can worsen. If you’re struggling with eye strain or need to “reset” your eyes often, like every 15 minutes, it’s time to see an eye doctor.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/greek-vs-regular-yogurt/,"Greek Yogurt vs. Regular Yogurt: Is One Better? We break down the difference By Aaron Kassraie, AARP Comments En español Published January 03, 2024 It's important to choose the right yogurt to get the full nutritional benefit. Getty Images Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the endless options in the dairy aisle? Here’s a suggestion: Make plain low-to-no-fat yogurt a staple on your grocery list. Not only is it a versatile ingredient or a standalone snack, it also packs a punch of nutritional benefits. Whether you prefer the thicker, tangier Greek yogurt or the timeless appeal of regular yogurt depends on your culinary preferences and dietary needs. “Nutrition-wise, yogurt is probably one of the best ways to take in your dairy,” says William Lendway, a dietitian, chef and assistant professor at Johnson & Wales University, a school whose specialized degrees include culinary arts and nutrition. “It’s an easy source of protein and ﻿vitamin D because of its fortification and calcium.” Regularly enjoying yogurt can make it easier for your body to digest lactose and help you tolerate it better. And it’s not just about digestion. Foods like yogurt and kefir might also lower your chances of getting breast or colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart problems, a recent review of over 100 studies found. Plus, yogurt may help you maintain a healthy weight, keep your bones strong and support a happy gut. Greek yogurt vs. regular yogurt: key differences How is yogurt made? Broadly speaking, yogurt is a fermented dairy food made with milk and live active cultures, often referred to as “good bacteria.” Making yogurt starts by adding beneficial bacteria to pasteurized milk. These bacteria thrive on lactose and transform it into lactic acid, which infuses the yogurt with its distinctive tangy flavor. Over the course of six to eight hours, the mixture continues to ferment until it turns into yogurt, says Erin Coffield, a dietitian and vice president of health and wellness communications for the National Dairy Council. Regular yogurt is turned into Greek yogurt by straining it with a cheese cloth or a stainless-steel sieve for 24 to 36 hours until its volume is reduced by half. Consistency You’ll notice that Greek yogurt is thicker. That’s because whey, the watery liquid you see at the top of regular yogurt, is removed from the Greek variety through the straining process. That extra step gives Greek yogurt a creamier consistency. Nutritional benefits of yogurt Both Greek and regular yogurt have a distinct nutritional profile, and the choice between them depends on your nutritional goals. “From protein to things like calcium and vitamins, they are going to be in both regular and Greek yogurt,” says Coffield. However, the specific quantities of those nutrients may differ between the two. Whether it’s Greek or regular, yogurt can be a healthy part of your diet. It’s a good source of protein, calcium and B vitamins, and also improves your gut microbiome. One analysis of studies published in Nutrition Reviews found links between eating yogurt and lower risk of breast and colon cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies also linked yogurt consumption to healthy weight. Protein If your focus is on incorporating more protein in your diet, you’ll want to steer towards Greek yogurt. On average, low-fat Greek yogurt contains as much as 10 grams of protein, compared to 5 grams in regular low-fat yogurt. That’s double the protein! More protein in your diet is beneficial for muscle recovery and growth, and it helps keep you feeling fuller longer. Sugar Yogurt is one of those healthy foods that can easily be made less healthy because of the sugar content. Some yogurts taste like dessert. Just a cup of strawberry flavored yogurt can have 15 grams of sugar, 12 of which are added to make it taste sweeter. Instead of buying yogurts with added sugar, choose plain yogurt and customize it at home with your favorite fruit or nuts. Carbohydrates Lactose inherently contains carbohydrates, and it’s present in whey, that watery layer you find on top of regular yogurt. While both yogurt varieties contain carbohydrates, Greek yogurt tends to have less. This is due to the straining process, which eliminates water containing carbohydrates, ultimately reducing the yogurt’s overall carb count. Fat Nutritionists usually suggest choosing nonfat yogurt. Do that and you’ll find both regular and Greek yogurts with less than 1 gram, as they’re made with skim milk. But if you go full fat, regular yogurt has fewer fat grams. A 100﻿-gram serving of full-fat Greek yogurt has 5 grams of fat, half of it being saturated. Conversely, the same portion of regular yogurt made from whole milk contains 3 grams of fat, with 2 grams of saturated fat. “A little disclaimer that goes along with promoting dairy products is that we usually suggest that people get a lower fat version of it,” Lendway says. U.S. dietary guidelines recommend that adults eat three servings of dairy a day and that saturated fat be limited to less than 10 percent of your daily calories. However, some studies suggest full-fat dairy may be better for weight loss and heart disease, despite its high calorie count as long as there is a focus on fermented dairy products and limiting butter and cream. Calcium Regular yogurt has more calcium than Greek yogurt because the straining of Greek yogurt removes some of the original calcium. However, in both instances, yogurt is an easy way to get calcium, because you don’t have to eat as much of it compared to green vegetables. “I’m all for eating green vegetables, but sometimes it’s a little bit hard to get your calcium and iron from these vegetable sources. You just have to eat more of it,” Lendway says. For example, even though cooked kale boasts 150 mg of calcium, it falls short of the 183 mg found in an equivalent serving of low-fat regular yogurt. Opting for full-fat yogurt doesn’t provide any additional calcium compared to its low-fat counterpart either. Probiotics “When it comes to the best bang for the buck, yogurt is one of our best dairy sources. And one of the biggest pros in that is having those probiotics,” Lendway says. Probiotics play a crucial role in digestion, supporting the immune system and absorbing essential vitamins. Certain medications like antibiotics can kill a lot of those essential bacteria. Lendway recommends repopulating what’s lost by having multiple servings of yogurt (or other fermented foods), especially after a round of antibiotics. Lactose Thanks to its straining process, Greek yogurt has less lactose than regular yogurt. But even regular yogurt has less lactose than milk due to the fermentation process that eats away at the naturally occurring sugar. Therefore, some people with an intolerance to other dairy products might be able to eat yogurt without complications and may eventually begin to better tolerate lactose in general. How to incorporate yogurt into cooking Plain yogurt can act as a blank canvas in recipes, as it is capable of transforming into both sweet and savory creations. Whether it’s eaten straight from the container or incorporated into various dishes, it’s a protein-rich option that requires neither knife nor fork, making it particularly well-suited for individuals with hand mobility issues or dysphagia, where swallowing poses a challenge. “It’s an ancient food that delivers on modern 21st century wellness need﻿s,” Coffield says. Baking: Make pizza crust, pancakes and cheesecakes with yogurt as a healthier alternative in baking. Doing so makes traditional baked goods more nutritious. Marinade: Use yogurt as a marinade for meat to enhance tenderness. Appetizers: Create diverse appetizers, such as ranch dip and homemade yogurt cheese (labneh). Substitution in recipes: Swap out mayonnaise with yogurt in dishes such as potato salad, dips, macaroni salad or coleslaw for a healthier twist. You can also use yogurt to replace cream in foods like soup by adding it to the dish during the final stages of cooking.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/health-benefits-fiber/,"The New Types and Benefits of Fiber Turns out, not all fiber is created equal when it comes to protecting your heart or lowering blood sugar Getty Images By Melinda Hemmelgarn, AARP En español Published June 20, 2019 It used to be when we thought about fiber, one word likely came to mind: “roughage.” These days, the benefits of what's essentially the nondigestible components of plant foods are seen as much bigger. Fiber's even been called “the new protein” for all the attention it's attracting. Among other things, fiber-rich diets have been shown to reduce the risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer and, most significantly, cardiovascular disease, says Joanne Slavin, a registered dietitian and professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota. The growing awareness of the critical role our gut microorganisms (microbiota) play in both physical and mental health has also brought heightened interest to the benefits of consuming fiber-rich foods. Not all fiber is the same We're also learning more about the different types and properties of dietary fiber, which has for some time been divided into soluble and insoluble types. Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water, can help lower glucose levels and blood cholesterol. Foods with soluble fiber include oatmeal, nuts, beans, lentils, apples and blueberries. Insoluble fiber helps food move through your digestive system, preventing constipation. Foods with this type of fiber include wheat, whole wheat bread, whole grain couscous, brown rice, legumes, carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes. More recently recognized, however, are factors such as viscosity and fermentability. For example, the viscous and soluble fibers found in oats, barley and psyllium form a gel in the intestinal tract, which slows digestion and binds with cholesterol and fats, thereby helping to control blood sugar and lower blood lipids. ""Fiber really is fuel for the gut,” says Slavin. Fermentable fibers, including fruit pectin, beta-glucans in barley and oats, and oligosaccharides in beans, are metabolized by gut bacteria to produce beneficial short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs provide energy to cells in the colon, help improve mineral absorption, and lower the pH in the colon, which inhibits growth of disease-causing bacteria. Many fermentable fibers are also considered “prebiotic” because they promote the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria. Inulin, for example, is a prebiotic fiber found naturally in onions, garlic, leeks, wheat and oats. It's also extracted from chicory root, a plant that's part of the dandelion family. If there's a celebrity fiber type at the moment, it's this one, which has recently been added to things like beverages or power bars that wouldn't normally contain fiber. While studies have linked inulin to weight loss and the lowering of blood sugar — among other things, it seems to slow appetite signals to the brain as well as slow stomach emptying, leaving you feeling fuller, longer — taking in too much inulin too fast, especially if you're not used consuming it, can lead to digestive upset. How much do we need? For folks over 50, the Institute of Medicine recommends 30 grams of dietary fiber per day for men, 21 grams for women. These numbers are based on the cardio-protective amount of 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories consumed. Unfortunately, most Americans get half this amount. Teresa Martin, a registered dietitian based in Bend, Ore., who presented on fiber, gut microbes and disease prevention at the 2018 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics annual meeting, recommends 35 to 50 grams of fiber per day to see therapeutic effects and to promote a healthy gut microbiota. Sources of fiber Even though fiber is naturally present in fruits, vegetables, beans, peas, whole grains, nuts and seeds, 95 percent of Americans come up short for a variety of reasons. For one, highly processed low-fiber foods are ubiquitous in our environment. Two, the recent popularity of gluten-free, wheat-free, keto and paleo diets all limit grains; yet according to Slavin, whole grains are the no. 1 source of fiber in the American diet. Last, there's confusion about which foods are highest in fiber. For example, just because a label says “whole grain” does not mean the food is high in fiber. Check the Nutrition Facts panel on packaged food labels to choose those providing at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. And what about supplements? The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends getting your fiber foremost from foods such as fruits and veggies. This is because whole foods have benefits beyond fiber; they deliver vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other beneficial plant compounds that often work synergistically. Fiber supplements can be helpful in bumping up fiber intake, but they deliver only one type of fiber. Increasing your fiber intake Martin takes a novel approach for getting more fiber. Specifically, she suggests trying to consume 30 different plant species each day. For example, instead of having a plain lettuce salad, add diversity to your bowl with any number of extra ingredients: radishes, spinach, onions, carrots, tomatoes, cabbage, cucumbers, celery, arugula, dandelion leaves, avocado, beans, sunflower seeds, nuts and fresh or dried fruit. Be adventurous! For a list of fiber-rich food sources, check out the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, which list “high fiber bran ready-to-eat cereals” as the richest source of fiber, closely followed by cooked navy beans (though other options abound).

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/foods-for-bone-health/,"8 Surprising Foods That Can Help Strengthen Bones Go beyond dairy to help keep your skeleton healthy By Nissa Simon, AARP Comments En español Published December 05, 2023 There’s more to healthy bones than calcium-rich milk, although we all know that both milk and foods rich in vitamin D are good for your bones. Bone is living tissue that constantly rebuilds and repairs itself. Alas, after age 50, bones start to lose density and strength and become porous, which leads to a bone disease called osteoporosis that increases the risk of broken bones. Chances of developing osteoporosis are greater if you’re a woman; however, men also risk developing it, especially after age 70. To keep bones strong, we need two nutrients in particular — calcium and vitamin D. Our bodies cannot make calcium, so eating calcium-rich foods is vital. Vitamin D, for its part, helps the body absorb calcium from food and seems to help protect older adults against osteoporosis. Calcium Needs How much calcium you need depends on your age and sex. The National Institutes of Health recommends 1,000 mg a day for men 51 to 70 years old and 1,200 mg a day for women in that age group. After 70, both men and women should plan on 1,200 mg of calcium daily. Some people don’t have the taste or tolerance for dairy, but a variety of foods can help boost bone health. Although few foods have the calcium levels of dairy, if you combine several of those listed below, you can get a full day’s worth. And other nutrients — such as potassium and vitamin C — are important to keeping bones strong, as we explain below. Here are eight foods to incorporate into your diet that can help keep your bones healthy. Getty Images 1. Dried figs These chewy delights are a good source of both calcium and potassium, minerals that work together to help prevent osteoporosis. Dried figs contain healthy plant-based nutrients (phytochemicals) as well as chemicals that can help prevent cell damage (antioxidants). An added plus, according to Christopher Gardner, professor of medicine at Stanford University, is that dried figs are delectably sweet and provide a super-easy snack. You can store them in an airtight container at room temperature for six to 12 months. Quick tip: Cut the figs into chunks (discard the hard stem) and combine them with other dried fruits and nuts for a customized trail mix. Serving size: 60 grams (about 2 ounces) Calcium content: 96 mg Getty Images 2. Broccoli According to a recent survey by Green Giant, broccoli took the number 1 spot as America’s favorite vegetable, followed by carrots and corn. That’s a smart choice, considering that broccoli has easily absorbed calcium and other healthful nutrients, including those essential for bone formation and prevention of bone-density loss. Broccoli is also rich in vitamin C, which also plays a role in protecting against bone loss. You can eat broccoli either raw or cooked. Although some people don’t like the taste of raw broccoli, it’s perfectly safe to eat. Quick tip: If you prefer cooked broccoli to raw, be sure to make the most of its calcium content by steaming or sautéing instead of boiling. Serving size: ½ cup raw Calcium content: 112 mg Calcium Needs How much calcium you need depends on your age and sex. The National Institutes of Health recommends 1,000 mg a day for men 51 to 70 years old and 1,200 mg a day for women in that age group. After 70, both men and women should plan on 1,200 mg of calcium daily. Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images 3. Almonds In spite of the fact that most of us call almonds nuts, they’re not true nuts, they’re seeds; but no matter what you call them, almonds really are a kind of super-nut. Not only do they provide calcium, a mainstay of strong bones, they also offer phosphorus, the second most abundant mineral in the body, which is important for the formation of bones. More than 85 percent of the phosphorus in the adult body is found in the bones. One of its key functions is working together with calcium to form and keep teeth and bones healthy, as well as to help maintain your energy levels. Phosphorus also plays a key role in how well our nerve cells and brain function. Quick tip: Fit a couple of dozen almonds into a small bag to take along as an on-the-go snack. Sprinkle chopped almonds on salads to add flavor and crunch. Serving size: Just under ½ cup, about a handful Calcium content: 75 mg Getty Images 4. Oranges These lovely globes are packed with vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, which may help increase bone density, especially in the spine.﻿ One study suggests that vitamin C decreases the risk of osteoporosis in people with lower levels of physical activity. In addition, vitamin C is crucial to the production of collagen, the most abundant protein in the body and a major component of bone. Oranges also contain calcium, albeit a small amount. The good news: The vitamin C present in oranges boosts the absorption of calcium from food and has the potential to speed bone healing after a fracture. Quick tip: Orange peels contain natural oils. A few rubs of the peel can polish water-stained metal appliances and faucets. Serving size: One medium-size orange Calcium content: 55 mg Getty Images 5. Prunes Dried plums, commonly called prunes, are best known for their ability to prevent constipation and possibly colon cancer. But prunes have many other health benefits. One study concluded that eating five or six prunes a day for six months resulted in preservation of bone at the hip. Fractures can occur in any bone but are most common in the bones of the hip, spine and wrist. Start out with a prune or two a day for a week to determine if they cause diarrhea. If not, then gradually build up to five or six prunes spread over the course of the day. Quick tip: Thanks to their natural sweetness, prunes can spice up mundane dishes. Chop a few into fine bits and scatter on a green salad, or mash into a sharp cheese and spread on crackers for a between-meals snack. Serving size: ¼ cup (5 prunes) Calcium content: 20 mg Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images 6. Beans Beans of all kinds are a stellar source of calcium, a mineral the body needs to build and maintain strong bones. Calcium comes from the food you eat; your body cannot produce it. Without sufficient calcium in your diet, your body takes it from your bones; over time they become weaker and prone to breaking. Beans also provide magnesium, a mineral that supports healthy bones. Beans are also rich in the mineral phosphorus, which your body needs to make energy. Quick tip: To prepare dried beans for cooking, add six cups of water for each two cups of beans. Heat to boiling and boil for three minutes. Remove from heat, cover and soak overnight. If you’re using canned beans, simply rinse and drain. Serving size: 80 raw Calcium content: White beans: 132 mg; red beans: 93 mg Getty Images 7. Sweet potatoes Surprise! It’s not a potato. This tuber, a specialized storage root that grows below the soil, is a member of the morning glory family not the nightshade family. This colorful vegetable is an excellent source of vitamin A, which is essential for maintaining healthy bones and cartilage, the strong connective tissue that protects joints and bones. Cartilage surrounds the ends of your bones, cushioning the spaces in your joints where bones meet, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Sweet potatoes are also loaded with magnesium, a mineral that reduces the risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis. Quick tip: Don’t store sweet potatoes in the fridge — refrigeration can bring on a hard center and unpleasant taste. Instead, keep them in a cool, dry area with good ventilation. Serving size: 1 cup mashed Calcium content: 76 mg Getty Images 8. Tofu Tofu, made from soybeans, is packed with calcium and magnesium, two minerals that help your body build and maintain strong bones. Most of the calcium is stored in your bones, the remainder in blood, muscle and other tissue. Magnesium reduces the risk of fractures and helps prevent the onset of osteoporosis. In addition, this soy-based food is rich in protein, which is an important part of a healthy diet. Proteins are made up of chemical building blocks called amino acids. Your body uses amino acids to build and repair bones and muscles. Quick tip: Cut a block of leftover tofu into slices or cubes and freeze them overnight on a baking sheet; just make sure they’re not touching one another. Store in a covered container. Frozen tofu will last for several months. To defrost, uncover the cubes and put them on a plate in the refrigerator for a few hours.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/types-of-eye-drops-and-how-to-use-them/,"4 Types of Eye Drops and How to Use Them Safely These can help with dryness, redness, allergies and irritation Getty Images By Hallie Levine, AARP En español Published February 18, 2023 Millions of Americans use over-the-counter eye drops every year to treat common problems such as dryness, redness and itching. If you’re one of them, an alert from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which found that two brands of eye drops were linked to drug-resistant bacteria — may have you worried that you’re at increased risk of infection. The reassuring news is that most likely you’re not. The CDC’s recommendation was specific for two brands of artificial tears products — EzriCare and Delsam Pharma. In general, “over-the-counter eye drops are safe to use,” says Stephanie Erwin, an optometrist at the Cleveland Clinic. It may still be overwhelming for you to figure out which drop is right for you. “There could be 40 or 50 different eye drops available, so it may be difficult for someone to determine what is best,” she says. Here’s a look at four types of over-the-counter eye drops, and what you should use, when. 1. Artificial tears These drops are used to lubricate eyes. They are designed to treat dry eye, a condition in which your eyes don’t produce enough tears. It becomes more common with age, due to hormonal changes, especially among postmenopausal women. You can help prevent dry eye by avoiding environmental triggers, such as low humidity, says Anat Galor, M.D., spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and professor of ophthalmology at the University of Miami. But you may need to restore tear health by using over-the-counter artificial tears, she says. There are two main types of artificial tears on the market: those that have preservatives, which are found in bottles, and those that are preservative-free, which are packaged in individual vials, says Laura Palazzolo, M.D., an ophthalmologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. In general, it’s best to opt for the latter “if dry eye is more severe and you need to use drops more than four times a day,” Palazzolo says. Since high quantities of preservatives can be toxic on eyes, you want to “use preservative-free tears to limit the total amount of preservative exposure,” she says. It’s true that preservative-free eye drops, such as the ones involved in the recall, carry a higher risk of infection, notes Christopher Starr, M.D., a clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The preservatives have antimicrobial qualities that can prevent bacteria and fungus from growing. But that shouldn’t deter you from using preservative-free products. Check your bottle or package label to make sure it isn’t one of the recalled products, Starr advises. If it isn’t, it’s safe to use. Just make sure that the eye drops aren’t expired, and keep the bottle or vial tip clean and free of contamination. 2. Nighttime dry eye drops These are thicker and usually come in a gel or ointment form to help keep your eyes hydrated overnight. The benefit is that “the drops obviously last longer, but trying to see through something thick and goopy is difficult because it makes your vision blurry for a little while,” says Vicente Diaz, M.D., a Yale Medicine eye doctor who is the chief of ophthalmology at Bridgeport Hospital in Connecticut. That’s why eye specialists recommend that you apply them right before you hop into bed in the evening. Though they often contain preservatives, that’s usually not an issue, since you use them only once per day, Diaz points out. 3. Antihistamine eye drops These drops can help relieve eye itching and redness due to allergies. “They block histamine, a chemical released by the allergy response that causes itchiness,” Erwin says. It’s a good idea to see your eye doctor if you notice symptoms of eye allergies, Galor says. These can include itching, burning, redness, tearing, puffy eyelids and stringy eye discharge. A specialist can examine the lining of your eyes to make sure your symptoms are caused by allergies. If they are, over-the-counter antihistamine eye drops are the best solution, rather than allergy medications that you take by mouth. “An antihistamine itself can dry eyes out,” Galor explains. One quick tip: Store your drops in the fridge, and take them out as needed. “The cold sensation will help soothe the eye,” Palazzolo says. It’s fine to use preservative-free eye drops, as well, if you also have dry eye. Palazzolo recommends that you apply one, wait five minutes, then apply the second one. This way, “one does not dilute the other,” she says. 4. Anti-redness eye drops These drops contain ingredients such as tetrahydrozoline that work to reduce redness by constricting blood vessels around the eye. Experts don’t recommend them other than for very occasional use. “If these are used daily and consistently, they will have the opposite effect: Blood vessels will dilate and become bigger so that the eyes become even more red,” Palazzolo says. It’s OK to use them in a very rare situation, such as an event where you need to have your eyes look more white in a photo, she says. Using them more often may be problematic: “If your eyes are red daily, it’s probably for a reason,” she says. “There might be something else going on. You want to treat the cause, not mask it.” If you need to use something for a one-off event, Palazzolo recommends an eye drop that contains low-dose brimonidine tartrate, a drug normally used to treat glaucoma patients. “It has the side effect to make blood vessels smaller, so they do not appear as red,” she says. It’s less harsh than traditional anti-redness drops. How to lower risk of eye infections Regardless of which drops you choose, there are a few things you can do to ensure that you use them safely to reduce the risk of infection. Starr advises that you don’t let anything come in contact with the bottle tip. That includes your eyeball. To insert drops safely, he recommends, you tilt your head back, pull the lower eyelid down and away from the eye and “drop the drop” from a distance. “If you’re not sure if the drop got into the eye, it’s generally safe to try again,” he says. If you think your bottle tip has been contaminated, he says you should either throw it away or clean the tip with alcohol and let it air-dry before reusing. If you develop eye discharge, redness or pain, see your eye doctor right away, since these could all indicate infection that may require other treatments, such as antibiotic eye drops. What types of drops can contact lens wearers use? If you have contact lenses, you may wonder if you can use eye drops while wearing them. The answer is yes, eye doctor Vicente Diaz says, but “the thicker a drop is, the less of a good idea it is.” Rewetting drops and most of those for dry eye (sold over the counter in drugstores) are fine, since they are very thin and won’t distort your vision, he says. But if you have a thicker drop, such as a gel or ointment, it can stick to your contact lens and make it hard for you to see, he says. Since these are usually only applied at night, before bed, it’s less of an issue. If your doctor prescribes an eye drop, talk to them about contact lens use.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/foods-help-acid-reflux/,"8 Foods That Help Acid Reflux and Heartburn Learn the best and worst foods to prevent GERD By Barbara Stepko, Updated July 24, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published November 16, 2021 / Updated July 24, 2023 Getty Images The meal may be over, but for some the memory lingers on. And not in a good way. Heartburn, chest pain, belching, coughing, regurgitation — it’s all part of an all too familiar picture for those who suffer from heartburn. If you’re one of the 20 percent of adults who frequently experience these symptoms, incorporating foods that help curb acid reflux into your diet may alleviate discomfort and promote better digestive health. What is acid reflux or GERD? Chronic acid reflux, known as gastroesophageal reflux disease﻿ (or GERD), is a condition caused by the flow of contents from the stomach upward into the esophagus. What’s behind the burn: a weakening or malfunctioning of a ring of muscle at the base of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). When this doesn’t close properly, any acid-containing contents of your stomach can flow back up into the esophagus. While antacids and other over-the-counter medications can help tame stomach acid, dietary tweaks can reduce the frequency and intensity of symptoms such as heartburn. But keep in mind that “every person is different,” says Julie Stefanski, ﻿a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Your doctor or a registered dietitian can help identify which specific foods may ease your heartburn. Here are eight foods that can help you find relief from heartburn or GERD. Oatmeal is a high-fiber food that helps absorb stomach acid. Garcia Fotografia / 500px / Getty Images 8 foods that help prevent acid reflux 1. High fiber foods According to a small 2018 World Journal of Gastroenterology study, high-fiber consumption may minimize issues with GERD. “High﻿-fiber foods make you feel full,” says Neena Mohan, ﻿assistant ﻿professor of ﻿clinical ﻿medicine in ﻿gastroenterology at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University. “That’s a good thing, because you’re less likely to overeat, which can contribute to heartburn.” What’s more, oatmeal in particular absorbs stomach acid. Other high-fiber options: whole﻿-grain bread, brown rice and quinoa﻿,﻿ ﻿﻿a﻿s﻿ ﻿w﻿e﻿l﻿l﻿ ﻿a﻿s﻿ green vegetables ﻿s﻿u﻿c﻿h﻿ ﻿a﻿s﻿ asparagus, broccoli and ﻿brussel﻿s sprouts. But remember, Stefanski﻿ says﻿: “Fiber can’t work unless there is also enough fluid in your diet,” so make sure to drink plenty of water. ﻿ Bananas are a good option because they are low in acid and can neutralize an irritated stomach. Marko Geber / Getty Images 2. Bananas This low-acid or alkaline fruit can help neutralize stomach acid by coating an irritated esophageal lining. And not only are bananas alkaline, they’re also rich in pectin — a soluble fiber that helps keeps food flowing nicely through the digestive tract. This can help you feel full longer, so you’re less likely to overeat. Other alkaline foods include: Melons (particularly cantaloupe and honeydew)Grains (like wild rice, oats and quinoa)CauliflowerAlmonds Leafy greens are easy on the gut and won’t cause painful gas. Yagi Studio / Getty Images 3. Salad greens Pile up your plate! These mild green leafy veggies are alkaline, so they’re easy on the gut and won’t cause painful gas.﻿ In fact, a small 201﻿7 study, published in JAMA Otalaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery, showed that people who followed a plant-based Mediterranean diet heavy in such produce reported less ﻿frequent acid reflux symptoms. Just resist the urge to add high-fat dressings, acidic vinaigrettes or toppings such as onions, which can trigger GERD, Stefanski notes. Yogurt can sooth heartburn and promote a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut. seb_ra / Getty Images 4. Dairy Milk and yogurt act as a temporary buffer, soothing heartburn symptoms. “One of the reasons we’re symptomatic with acid reflux is because it causes damage to the lining of the esophagus,” says Nipaporn Pichetshote, M﻿.D﻿., a ﻿gastroenterology ﻿specialist at UCLA Medical Center. “Milk and yogurt coat the esophagus so you don’t feel that acid irritating that lining.” More happiness: Yogurt is rich in probiotics, which promote a healthy balance of bacteria in your gut, helping with digestion — along with upping absorption of nutrients. Opt for skim or low-fat varieties rather than those made from whole milk. “Foods that are higher in fat can cause more reflux,” Pichetshote﻿ says.﻿ Ginger is anti-inflammatory and can help those vulnerable to vomiting. All Nea / 500px / Getty Images 5. Ginger tea A cup or two a day may offer a triple﻿ whammy of benefits. Not only is this soothing drink alkaline, it’s also anti-inflammatory, which can help relieve gastroesophageal irritation and soothe the stomach. Ginger can also help ease nausea — helpful for those vulnerable to vomiting during acid reflux episodes. Oatmeal is a high-fiber food that helps absorb stomach acid.

This pinkish fish — along with other lean proteins such as chicken and turkey — is always a smart choice. Salmon is easy to digest and won’t linger in your stomach for a long time, reducing your risk of reflux. If you choose chicken or turkey, remember to remove the fatty skin and opt for baking, broiling or grilling, instead of frying. Add flavor with herbs (think parsley and basil) instead of spices, if they bother your belly. Watermelon is a great option to counteract stomach acid and provide anti-inflammatory properties. Charlene Collins 7. Water-based foods Gut-friendly water-based foods like celery, cucumber and watermelon can help counteract stomach acid. Like its name suggests, watermelon is made up of 92 percent water and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, which helps ease digestion. Sweet potatoes can help fill you up and are a nutrient powerhouse. Aniko Hobel 8. Root vegetables Root vegetables — think sweet potatoes, carrots and beets — boast soluble fiber, which is easy to digest. They also do a nice job of filling you up so you don’t overeat, which can lead to heartburn. Need more reasons to put a fork in it? These nutrient powerhouses are not spicy or acidic, or high in fat. Heartburn relief tips Sometimes it is not just what you eat, but how you eat. Check out these tips for taming those searing symptoms. Maintain a healthy weight Obesity — particularly when those extra pounds gather around your middle — increases abdominal pressure, upping the chance that stomach acid will be forced up into the esophagus. “Weight is the biggest trigger for GERD,” says Rena Yadlapati, M.D., a gastroenterologist and medical director of the Center for Esophageal Diseases at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s been shown in studies that weight loss, particularly around the belly, is the most impactful lifestyle intervention for reducing reflux symptoms.” Don't slouch when eating It may be tempting to settle into the cushions and watch TV while inhaling that plate of buffalo wings. But sitting less than straight while you chow down can encourage gastric juices to head in the wrong direction. “Liquid and gas want to go to the path of least resistance,” Pichetshote﻿ says. “If you’re laying down it can easily go up toward your head. If you’re a little more upright, it has to fight gravity to move upward.” The same goes for sleeping: Wait at least two to three hours after eating before hitting the sack. Avoid overreating and eat slowly Overeating is never a good idea. When your stomach is distended and bloated, acid can rise back into the esophagus, triggering symptoms. But an empty stomach can cause problems, too. Go more than three to four hours without a meal or snack, and stomach acid — which would usually be used in the digestive process to break down food — collects. Eat smaller meals throughout the day and eat slowly. And choose water to wash things down. Avoid tight-fitting clothes Clothes that are snug around the midsection can constrict the belly area, squeezing your stomach and pushing acid up into the esophagus, ﻿says Gulchin Ergun, M﻿.D﻿., a gastroenterology specialist in Houston and ﻿professor of medicine in digestive disorders at Houston Methodist Hospital﻿. Work out wisely For some people, exercise can trigger acid reflux symptoms — particularly moves that increase abdominal pressure, such as crunches. Stick with seated and standing exercises that allow gravity to work to your advantage. Take it slow — too much jostling of the stomach contents may make problems worse. Your best bet: low-impact, low-intensity moves such as walking. Salmon’s omega-3 fatty acids help the heart and are easy to digest. Catherine Falls Commercial Watermelon is a great option to counteract stomach acid and provide anti-inflammatory properties. Charlene Collins Sweet potatoes can help fill you up and are a nutrient powerhouse. Aniko Hobel Foods that cause heartburn Adjusting your diet may play a key role in managing the symptoms of GERD.﻿ You﻿ may well﻿ find one or more of the following eight foods pops up as a problem, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should completely remove them from your diet. Moderation is key. Experts say you can uncover your specific triggers by paying close attention to how your body reacts to what you’re eating. (Keeping a food diary can help.) 1. Fried, fatty foods Foods that are high in fat and drenched in oil (bacon, sausage, french fries, potato chips and do﻿ughnuts, to name a few) are digested slowly and sit in your stomach longer, giving gastric acid more time to work its way up into your esophagus, increasing your risk of heartburn. And high-fat food can cause weight gain. That extra poundage increases pressure on your abdomen, making it easier for fluid to travel upward into the esophagus. Tip:﻿ Opt instead ﻿for lean cuts of meat, chicken and fish, cooked on the grill or in the oven. 2. Citrus fruits Their ﻿vitamin C may be the draw, but these fruits’ high acid content makes them risky for reflux. (Our stomachs naturally produce a lot of acid﻿; why make things worse?) Lemon﻿s and limes are the biggest culprits, but oranges, grapefruit, grapes and blueberries make the list, too. 3. Tomatoes Also highly acidic, this common base for many meals ﻿can aggravate an already cranky digestive tract —﻿ and no, cooking tomatoes won’t help. Tip: If you can’t resist the robust flavor of marinara sauce, ﻿neutralize the acid by adding ﻿one-quarter teaspoon of baking soda to your recipe. 4. Chocolate Savoring a few pieces of Godiva chocolates probably won’t do a lot of damage, but polishing off half the box in one sitting may. Cacao is naturally acidic and can trigger a nasty burn — and the high fat content won’t do your digestion any favors. 5. Peppermint A cup of refreshing, mint-infused tea can calm a turbulent tummy. But peppermint, in any form, can also cause gastric reflux and heartburn. Tip﻿: Savor a cup of soothing chamomile tea or suck on licorice-flavored hard candy to soothe your stomach. 6. Carbonated beverages The bubbles in carbonated beverages are like air pockets, expanding in your belly. This increases pressure on the esophageal sphincter, increasing the risk for acid to reflux into the esophagus. Tip: Try decaf iced tea or dress up tap water with slices of cucumber. 7. Coffee While studies on the subject are mixed, some have shown that caffeinated beverages may impair the function of the muscles that separate the esophagus and stomach. What’s more, drinking caffeinated coffee may also increase the amount of acid that your stomach produces. 8. Alcohol More reasons to drink in moderation: Alcohol can irritate the esophagus and make the stomach produce more acid. ﻿Excessive drinking may also relax that gateway of the lower esophageal sphincter muscle. Tip: When it comes to wine, white is more acidic than red and may cause more heartburn. Beer is acidic﻿, and it’s carbonated — both bad news. But it has a lower alcohol content compared with other alcoholic beverages, and may be better for heartburn. Prefer the stronger stuff? Know this: Darker drinks (brandy, whiskey and ﻿dark rum) contain compound﻿s called congeners, which can increase stomach irritation and heartburn symptoms.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/is-dried-fruit-healthy/,"Is Dried Fruit Healthy? If you keep your servings in check, the convenient snack is better than many alternatives By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published December 20, 2024 Feig & Feig/StockFood It’s the star of the bulk food aisle, a staple in any hiker’s backpack and a key ingredient in your classic holiday fruitcake. But despite its name and origins, dried fruit often finds itself at the center of debate: Is it good for you? Or is it a sugar and calorie bomb? Here’s what you need to know about dried fruit, including how to shop for the healthiest options. Is dried fruit high in sugar? All fruit contains sugar — not the kind you find in candy bars and cereals, but natural sugar. One large apple has about 22 grams of the sweet stuff, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); an orange has about 14 grams. When you dry a piece of fruit, you remove nearly all the water, but the sugar content remains in a concentrated form, explains Alice H. Lichtenstein, professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University’s Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. A half of a raw apricot has about 1.6 grams of sugar, according to the USDA’s FoodData Central tool, which is similar to the amount of sugar in half of a dried apricot. The difference is, with dried fruit it can be easier to consume larger portions (and more calories) because you’re left with a smaller volume. You wouldn’t eat five or six raw apricots in one sitting, but it’s easy to eat five or six dried apricots. Similarly, 10 fresh grapes might be a satisfying snack, whereas 10 raisins don’t even fill your palm, so throwing back a handful isn’t difficult. “You need to watch your serving size; it's not a one-to-one,” says Amanda Sawyer, a registered dietitian and associate professor in the department of nutrition at University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. Indeed, a half cup of grapes, about 15 total, contains roughly 7.5 grams of sugar, whereas a half cup of raisins contains about 47 grams of sugar, according to the USDA. “You don't want to eat the size of a whole apple in dried fruit,” Sawyer says. Beware of added sugars and other ingredients Some dried fruits — particularly candied fruits — can contain added sugar so you’ll want to pay attention to the nutrient facts panel and ingredient list, Lichtenstein says. Cranberries, which are naturally tart, typically contain added sugar in their dried form. So do some brands of banana chips. Know, too, that some banana chip products even contain saturated fats, like coconut oil, so be sure to pay attention to the package and look for dried banana chips with no added sugars or oils. And when you mix dried fruits with say, the butter, sugar and eggs in fruitcake or white chocolate bark, any nutritional benefits are no doubt negated. Another consideration: Many types of dried fruits are sticky in texture, Lichtenstein points out, “so it's a good idea to be a little more aware of dental hygiene” after you eat it. What about fiber and other nutrients? You don’t lose out on fiber when you opt for dried over fresh, and that’s good news for the vast majority of Americans who are not meeting the recommended 25 to 30 grams per day. “If you're drying a piece of fruit that has the apple peel and the apple, you're getting the same amount of fiber as you would if you ate the apple, both the peel and the inside,” Sawyer says. And one plus, she adds: just like dried fruit has more sugar per volume than fresh fruit, it also has more fiber per volume. “So that's a really good thing about it,” she says — especially for older adults who may experience dwindling appetites and are looking for ways to pack in nutrition where they can. Extra fiber can be good for constipation relief too, which is a common complaint in older adults. One cup of dried apples has about 7.5 grams of fiber, whereas 1 cup of fresh, chopped apples has about 2.6 grams of fiber. What is fiber? Fiber is the material in plant-based foods that the body can’t absorb, so it passes through the system undigested. It can help regulate blood sugar, keep hunger in check and promote regular bowl movements. According to the American Heart Association, fiber also helps protect against a number of age-related health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and certain types of cancer. Dried fruit is going to continue to hold on to some of its other nutrients, as well, Sawyer says, such as potassium, magnesium, calcium and some antioxidants. However, not all of the vitamins will survive the drying process, she explains. For example, “it’s unlikely it's going to have as much of something like vitamin C, which gets destroyed by heat,” Lichtenstein says. A few other perks One nice thing about dried fruit is that it’s convenient, SNAP eligible and shelf stable, Sawyer says. “And if you live alone, buying fruit in bulk is hard because it goes bad.” That’s not to say dried fruit — which you can make at home using a low-temp oven or a food dehydrator — should be a replacement for fresh or frozen, Lichtenstein says. “But it's a reasonable choice,” she says, especially compared to other snack foods that lack fiber and other nutrients. Lichtenstein recommends using dried fruit rather than table sugar or other sweeteners in vinaigrettes and marinades. The fruit will soften in the liquid and release sweetness and flavor, she says. Sawyer suggests throwing dried fruit on top of oatmeal or plain yogurt to boost the fiber and nutrient profile. What is fiber?

Common symptoms to expect after a shot. Plus, simple ways to alleviate discomfort​ By Rachel Nania, Updated October 21, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 24, 2021 / Updated October 21, 2024 Getty Images The COVID-19 vaccines have been updated for the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season to more closely match the latest versions of the coronavirus that continue to spread and cause infections. The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna target the KP.2 “FLiRT” variant that contributed to the summer swell in cases, and the vaccine from Novavax targets its ""parental strain,"" JN.1. While these two variants are no longer dominant in the U.S., their close relatives are, and doctors and researchers expect the updated shots will provide good protection against severe symptoms of COVID-19 heading into 2025. “COVID is [still] circulating with us,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Mandy Cohen, M.D., said in a news briefing. “So we need to continue to be vigilant.” Health officials are recommending that everyone ages 6 months and older get the updated vaccine this fall — especially older adults who are at higher risk for complications from COVID-19. Here’s what you need to know about any possible side effects from the vaccines. No surprises from common COVID vaccine side effects According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the common side effects that can accompany the updated 2024-2025 shots are in line with those of the previous versions. “So, if you had a sore arm before, if you had a little bit of achiness, maybe a little low-grade fever, you can expect that to happen again,” Kristin Englund, M.D., an infectious disease specialist with Cleveland Clinic, said in a news release. According to the CDC, the most commonly reported side effects of the COVID mRNA vaccines (from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) are: Pain, soreness, redness at injection siteFatigueHeadacheMuscle painJoint painChillsFeverNausea/vomiting (Moderna) And the most commonly reported side effects of the Novavax COVID vaccine, which uses a different and more traditional protein-based technology, are: Pain, soreness, redness, swelling at injection siteFatigueHeadacheMuscle painJoint painChillsFeverNausea/vomiting Alleviating COVID vaccine side effects The good news: If you’ve been vaccinated for COVID-19 — and millions of Americans have been — you likely already know what to expect and how your body may react. “I think people also understand how to manage the side effects better in terms of drinking plenty of water prior to getting a vaccine, drinking plenty of water after you get the vaccine, taking it easy the next day,” Robert Weber, administrator for pharmacy services at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and assistant dean for medical center affairs at the Ohio State University College of Pharmacy, told AARP. Taking an over-the-counter pain reliever afterward can help manage any discomfort, he added. Just know it’s not advised to take these medicines ahead of time to try to prevent potential side effects. And applying a clean, cool, wet washcloth to the injection site can help to relieve pain or swelling on the arm where you got the shot, the CDC says. Another tip: If your schedule allows, clear your calendar the day after your vaccine. “If you work during the week, you might want to get vaccinated on Friday or Saturday so that you don’t have to work when you’re not feeling great,” said Kawsar Talaat, M.D., an associate professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Just know that one day of not feeling well from the vaccine is far better than several days of not feeling well with COVID,” she added. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Not everyone experiences side effects after a COVID-19 vaccine; for most who do, symptoms tend to be mild to moderate and go away in a few days. That said, if your side effects are worrying or linger longer, it’s important to call your doctor. Serious reactions are rare, the CDC says, but they can happen. Anaphylaxis, a severe type of allergic reaction that can occur after any type of vaccination, has occurred at a rate of approximately 5 cases per 1 million COVID-19 vaccine doses administered, the CDC reports. Cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have also been reported following COVID-19 vaccination, though mostly in younger age groups.

Vaccines are key to preventing severe illness COVID-19 is still sending thousands of Americans to the hospital each week, the latest data shows, and public health experts say getting the updated vaccine can keep that number from swelling even more. Keep in mind that older adults have access to two other tools that can help them avoid illness from respiratory viruses: the annual influenza (flu) vaccine and the newer RSV vaccine, which protects against complications from respiratory syncytial virus — a common bug that hospitalizes as many as 160,000 people 65 and older each year. “We also know that you can get more than one virus at the same time and that people who do get multiple viruses tend to be sicker. And so, again, anything you can do to prevent infection is good,” Talaat said. ﻿ For those who do get flu or COVID-19 this year, antiviral treatments can help keep an infection from progressing to severe illness. ﻿Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include new information on 2024-2025 COVID vaccines.

Her memory used to be pretty good, she told him, but she now had to write everything down to remember.​​ “Three years later, she was having trouble paying her bills and forgetting to take her medication,” recalls Andrew Budson, M.D., chief of cognitive and behavioral neurology and director of the Center for Translational Cognitive Neuroscience at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System. “She knew her memory wasn’t perfect but didn’t realize how much things had progressed.” Two years after that, she was getting lost in her neighborhood and denying there was anything wrong with her memory. “As [patients] progress, they forget that they can’t remember. This is classic Alzheimer’s dementia.”​ JUMP TO SECTION Types of dementia Signs and symptoms What causes dementia? How is it diagnosed? Treatment and care Reducing risk for dementia ﻿﻿Dementia is an umbrella term for conditions that impair a person’s ability to think, reason and remember to levels that interfere with daily life. “Something in the brain goes wrong,” says Paul E. Schulz, M.D., director of the Neurocognitive Disorders Center at the UTHealth Houston McGovern Medical School. “And it affects the person’s real world.” Although the risk of dementia rises a great deal after age 65, it is not an inevitable part of aging. “It’s important to know it’s a disease; it’s not just normal aging or getting old,” says Melinda Power, director of the George Washington University Institute for Brain Health and Dementia. Dementia can be caused by several different diseases, including Alzheimer’s. “At the core of any dementia, brain cells die,” she adds. In the early stages, the person initially can compensate, by using labeled pillboxes, for example, or keeping notes, and often still can function. But gradually — often over years — the person begins to have trouble doing things for themselves. “There are multiple things going on in the brain,” Budson says. “What is common to all the dementias is that there is a process that is progressively killing brain cells. That is the commonality.” Types of dementia Alzheimer’s disease is by far the most common form, causing 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. But there are other forms, each with different causes and sometimes strikingly different symptoms. These include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia — which entered popular consciousness with news of actor Bruce Willis’ diagnosis in 202﻿3﻿. Some people can suffer from a combination of two or more of these, a condition known as mixed dementia. What these illnesses have in common is that they result from a progressive destruction of brain cells, affecting thinking, memory and behavior in various ways. Video: 5 Signs of Dementia JUMP TO SECTION Types of dementia Signs and symptoms What causes dementia? How is it diagnosed? Treatment and care Reducing risk for dementia Signs and symptoms of dementia Dementia is not the same as mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, an early stage of memory and cognitive loss not serious enough to impair a person’s daily activities. Some people with MCI — 10 to 15 percent — will progress to full-blown dementia each year. Others will not. “Mild cognitive impairment means there is some evidence that your thinking and memory are not as good as they should be, but not to the level where you can’t function independently,” Power says. “It’s true that people with MCI are more likely to develop dementia in their lifetime. It’s also true that many will revert back to normal cognition or never progress to dementia.” shapecharge / Getty Images The Stats More than 5﻿5 million people globally live with dementia, a number expected to rise to about 139 million by 2050., according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, an estimated 7.2 million Americans﻿ have the most common form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease. That number is projected to reach close to 14 million by 2060.﻿ Early-onset ﻿Alzheimer’s is﻿ much less common, affecting about 200,000 Americans younger than 65, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overall, women are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s than men. Black and Hispanic people are at greater risk for Alzheimer’s than white people. People with dementia, on the other hand, have progressed to a point where they can’t pay their bills, reliably take medications or drive safely. Eventually, they will struggle to make a grocery list or work the TV remote. They may get lost in their own neighborhood and no longer recognize loved ones. They may “remember” experiences they never had. They will stop being able to dress themselves or go to the toilet. With Alzheimer’s, people “have trouble remembering the answers to questions, so they end up asking them again and again and again,” Budson says.﻿ “﻿Other times, patients with Alzheimer’s can have false memories. For example, one of my patients watched a TV show about going on a trip to Europe, then told her family she went on this wonderful trip to Europe. She thought it all happened to her.” Dementia in its various forms can impair judgment, affect mood and personality, prompt odd behavior and distort how a person perceives what he or she sees. One of Schulz’s Alzheimer’s patients had trouble telling where objects are in space. “She is a math professor who can still do all her equations.” She wrote them down, so she could consult them. But she can’t find her phone on the table, he says. “She can look at a doorknob but can’t tell you which way the door will open.” Occasionally forgetting a name or misplacing a set of keys﻿ is normal as we age. The deficits associated with dementia are greater, and more devastating, since they seriously affect how a person lives and functions. “Many fear dementia more than a cancer diagnosis,” says Christine Kistler, M.D., who specializes in geriatric medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In a way, that’s understandable. “We’ve made remarkable advances in diagnosing and treating cancer, but there is nothing we can do to cure dementia.”﻿ shapecharge / Getty Images The Stats More than 5﻿5 million people globally live with dementia, a number expected to rise to about 139 million by 2050., according to the World Health Organization.

Dementia occurs when neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain quit working. They lose their connection to other brain cells and eventually die. We all lose neurons as we age, but the loss is much greater in dementia. risk factors for dementia, such as age and genetics, are impossible to change. But there are other﻿ factors that you can act upon — including diet and exercise, hearing loss and social isolation. How is dementia diagnosed? There is no single diagnostic test to say whether a person has dementia. So doctors use a variety of tests and tools to learn what’s going on with the patient, look for signs of disease and, most importantly, rule out other treatable conditions that may be causing the cognitive problems. Brain scans may be used, as well as other tests — on blood and spinal fluid — to detect changes within the brain and identify the presence of certain substances associated with dementia. Paper-and-pencil or computer-based tests of memory and thinking are also often used to help make a dementia diagnosis. ​Dementia treatment and care When it becomes impossible for a dementia patient to remain at home, the family often faces a wrenching, expensive decision about whether to move their loved one into a care facility. “The point at which a person can’t stay at home is unique to that person,” Kistler says. “It tends to be when the behaviors can’t be managed safely at home, and that includes caregiver burnout and distress.” Families don’t have to do this alone. Social workers affiliated with care facilities and doctors’ offices can often provide education on how to make this decision and how to make the transition in a way to have the best odds of success. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits The transition can be difficult and confusing, but there are steps families can﻿ take to ease the process. “Families can visit even if their loved ones don’t know them. A kind voice and caring actions can really help,” Kistler says. She also suggests taking the patient outside. ﻿﻿“We know nature is helpful — or play them music. Put familiar things in their room, such as photos — there is no reason to leave sterile walls there.” E﻿ven small gestures to keep a patient busy are meaningful. Power’s husband, a nurse, found a soothing way to comfort one elderly dementia patient who was anxious about being in a new facility. “She didn’t know where she was,” Power recalls. “My husband grabbed a stack of towels and said, ‘Could you fold the towels for the baby?’ It made her feel valued. She became calm. She had a purpose and felt good about it — and the feeling is what mattered in that moment.” Reducing risk for dementia Researchers say there are things you can do to reduce your risk, along with avoiding head injuries and maintaining hearing. These include stopping smoking, eating a healthy Mediterranean-style diet and exercising, controlling diabetes and managing heart disease risks, such as high cholesterol and hypertension. “We believe that what’s good for the heart is good for the brain,” Power says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/wildfire-smoke-heart-health-risks/,"Not Just the Lungs: Wildfire Smoke May Increase Heart Risks The haze isn’t just harmful to your airways. Research suggests it’s a cardiac hazard too By Rachel Nania, Updated July 25, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published June 09, 2023 / Updated July 25, 2023 Smoke from Canadian wildfires and similar natural disasters poses heart health risks. David Parsons / Getty Images Most people know that breathing in wildfire smoke can do a number on your airways, triggering everything from a coughing fit to a serious asthma attack. But inhaling the noxious air can be hazardous for your heart too. A 2020 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that breathing in heavy smoke from California wildfires increased the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (when the heart suddenly stops pumping) by up to 70 percent. Additional research has linked wildfire smoke to a significant increase in emergency room visits, particularly among older adults, for heart-related issues like irregular heart rhythm, heart failure, heart attacks and stroke. “Most people think of breathing problems and respiratory health dangers from wildfire smoke, but it’s important to recognize the impact on cardiovascular health, as well,” Comilla Sasson, M.D., vice president for science and innovation for emergency cardiovascular care at the American Heart Association and an emergency medicine physician, said in a news release. “Too often we leave that as a side story,” says Gaurab Basu, M.D., a health equity fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment. “And it really is one of the things I think most about in terms of the impacts of air pollution.” What is wildfire smoke? Wildfire smoke is a mix of gases and fine particles from burning trees and plants, buildings and other material. Source: CDC Wildfire smoke is chock full of pollutants — just think of everything a fire engulfs — including tiny pieces of liquids and solids, called fine particle pollution, that can lodge themselves deep in the lungs and possibly the bloodstream. Once in the body, researchers say, these microscopic particles can prompt an inflammatory response that can affect the cardiovascular system, especially in people who already have cardiovascular disease. “So, people who have any preexisting respiratory or heart-related conditions should take extra precautions because they are likely extra sensitive to the particles in the smoke,” says Katelyn O'Dell, an atmospheric scientist and a postdoctoral research scientist at George Washington University, who studies air pollution exposure and its health impacts. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), people with chronic heart disease may experience the following symptoms after exposure to fine particle pollution: Heart palpitationsUnusual fatigueLight-headednessShortness of breathChest tightness or pain in the chest, neck or shoulder Approximately 127.9 million U.S. adults had some form of cardiovascular disease between 2017 and 2020, statistics from the American Heart Association show. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for Americans. What is wildfire smoke? Wildfire smoke is a mix of gases and fine particles from burning trees and plants, buildings and other material. Source: CDC Lower your risks when there’s smoke Wildfires are nothing new, but they are becoming more frequent and more intense, experts say. “And those trends are projected to continue due to a drying and warming climate,” O’Dell adds. So it’s important to be prepared should the smoke from a blaze blanket your area. Here’s what the experts recommend: Check the air quality before venturing out. You can find updated air quality forecasts at airnow.gov or on your phone’s weather app. Depending on the index, adjust your activities accordingly — especially if it's hot out. A study published July 24 in the journal Circulation found that the risk of experiencing a fatal heart attack may be twice as high on days when it's both hot out and when there are high levels of fine particulate pollution in the air. Wildfire smoke can make anyone sick, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but older adults, pregnant women, children and people with preexisting respiratory and heart conditions are at higher risk when the air quality is poor. If you’re unsure of your risks, talk to your doctor. Take air-quality alerts seriously. “It can't bleed into the background,” says Basu, noting that air pollution kills an estimated 7 million people globally each year. “It’s a serious thing that we need to be very conscious of.” If you’re at high risk for a health issue from wildfire smoke and the air quality is worsening, stay indoors with the windows closed and avoid activities that contribute to poor air quality, like frying or burning candles. Be in touch with your doctor. The American Lung Association advises people with heart disease, lung disease and diabetes to talk to their doctor about any changes in medications that may be needed to help them cope with smoke. If you need to go out, mask up. One helpful tool that many people have on hand from the pandemic is an N95 mask or similar respirator. Cloth and paper masks won’t cut it when it comes to wildfire smoke. Make sure your mask has a good seal. Take a deep breath in: If the masks collapses when you inhale, you’re good to go. Use a portable air filter. Like masks, portable air filters became more popular during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We learned a lot of lessons from COVID,” Basu says. One being: “The health of the air we breathe is critical to our health,” he says. The American Heart Association’s 2020 scientific statement on air pollution exposure ranks portable air cleaners as one of the most effective ways to deal with air pollution. “Given their modest upfront cost ($50 to $200) and potential benefits in reducing cardiopulmonary outcomes, this measure has a high benefit for the cost,” the American Heart Association’s Sasson said. In the market for one? O’Dell recommends checking the California EPA’s website of certified air cleaners. You can also DIY one — called the Corsi-Rosenthal box — using a box fan, air filters and some duct tape. Stay hydrated. “Maintaining adequate oral hydration by drinking water and other fluids is also important to preserve the function of cilia, the microscopic broomlike cells in the airways that help sweep out particulate contaminants inhaled from the environment,” Clayton Cowl, M.D., a Mayo Clinic pulmonologist and clinical toxicologist, said in a news release. Know the warning signs of heart attack and stroke. Symptoms of chest discomfort, shortness of breath, numbness on one side, sudden speech difficulty and weakness all warrant emergency attention. There are several other warning signs of a heart attack or stroke — get familiar with them and call 911 if you or anyone around you experiences them.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/cancers-linked-to-alcohol/,"7 Cancers Linked to Alcohol Consumption Mounting research highlights the health dangers of drinking. Here’s what we’re learning By Michael Schroeder, Updated March 26, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published February 21, 2025 / Updated March 26, 2025 AARP; (GETTY IMAGES, 2) Alcohol-associated car crashes claim the lives of about 13,500 people annually in the U.S. Fittingly, billboards broadcast the dangers of getting behind the wheel impaired. But health officials say an even deadlier drinking-associated danger lurks in relative obscurity: An estimated 20,000 cancer deaths each year are attributed to alcohol consumption, according to the latest research and a recent Surgeon General’s advisory published in January. The direct link between alcohol use and cancer was first established decades ago, ""and evidence for this link has strengthened over time,” the advisory states, with former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who authored the report, emphasizing that alcohol is a preventable cause of about 100,000 cases of cancer annually. In fact, behind tobacco and obesity, alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer. Yet more than half of Americans don’t know alcohol consumption is linked to higher cancer risk, according to survey research highlighted in the advisory. The research to date shows alcohol use increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including: Breast (in women)ColorectumEsophagusLiverMouth (oral cavity)Throat (pharynx)Voice box (larynx) The more a person drinks, the greater the danger, but any alcohol consumption can have an impact. From the perspective of cancer risk, “there is no safe amount of alcohol,” says Noelle LoConte, M.D., a medical oncologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Carbone Cancer Center, who studies the link between alcohol and cancer. Yet while drinking socially is normalized, talking to a doctor about the health risks associated with drinking is not, LoConte says. Many people don’t know exactly how much alcohol they consume, she notes, or if they do, they may not disclose that amount to their physician. Breast cancer: Even “a little” might be too much Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women, with roughly 270,000 cases diagnosed annually. Within that massive number is another: About 16 percent, or more than 44,000 cases of breast cancer, are attributed to alcohol consumption, according to a 2024 research review published in the American Cancer Society’s flagship journal CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. Research consistently finds that alcohol can alter or raise hormone levels, including estrogen. Higher levels of the hormone can lead to mutations in breast tissue that cause cancer. “Even drinking within the guidelines, so one a day for women,” can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, LoConte says. Put another way, research finds about 11 out of every 100 women who consume less than one alcoholic beverage will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, as noted in the Surgeon General’s advisory. Two more than that, or 13 in every 100 women, who have one drink a day, and 15 in 100 women who have two drinks per day, will develop breast cancer. Of course, drinking is but one prominent risk factor that could raise a woman’s risk of developing cancer. Many others, starting with age, obesity, genetics/family history and environmental exposures (to radiation, for example), can also stack the deck against a person. Doctors encourage considering all risks. “If you’re a postmenopausal woman and there is a reason why your risk is higher than normal for breast cancer,” it’s important to factor that in when choosing whether to drink — and how much to drink, says William Dahut, M.D., chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society. Mouth, throat and esophageal cancers: The “dose-dependent” dangers of drinking Although head and neck cancers aren’t as common as breast cancer, the alcohol-related risk of developing these cancers is more pronounced and increases more sharply the more a person drinks. That risk is present even when a person stays within the recommended limit, which is two drinks per day for men (and, again, one drink per day for women), LoConte says. She recommends abiding by those guidelines at a minimum, “but really getting as low as comfortable” is ideal, she says. LoConte was the lead author of a 2018 statement on alcohol and cancer by the American Society of Clinical Oncology that outlined those “dose-dependent” relationships between total alcohol consumption and rates for certain cancers. Heavy drinkers — which the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines as men who consume five or more drinks on any day or 15 drinks or more per week, and women who have four or more drinks on any day or eight or more per week — developed oral cavity (mouth) and pharynx (throat) cancers and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at around five times the rate of non-drinkers. A predominant cause of these and other alcohol-related cancers (and a contributor to breast cancer) is a byproduct of the body’s breakdown of alcohol called acetaldehyde, which can damage DNA. Once damaged, cells can grow out of control and turn into tumors. A mix of risk factors – and a fluid approach to prevention Other cancer-causing substances and risk factors also mix dangerously with alcohol. As noted in the Surgeon General’s advisory, “carcinogens [a term for cancer-causing substances] from other sources, especially particles of tobacco smoke, can dissolve in alcohol, making it easier for them to be absorbed into the body, increasing the risk for mouth and throat cancers.” The challenge for public health experts and frustration for social drinkers alike is that there’s no one-size-fits-all recommendation for drinking. But a general principle holds: “It seems the more you do drink, the greater the risk would be — and factoring that into your individual risk becomes really important,” Dahut says. That’s true for those who have already been diagnosed with cancer who drink alcohol, too. “It pretty much complicates every step of cancer treatment,” LeConte says, pointing to research on cancer patients who imbibe. “Their surgery stays are longer, they have more surgical complications, they [don’t tolerate] chemotherapy as well, they have higher rates of cancer recurrence.” For some time, it’s been known that heavy drinkers have more infections — “evidence of a ‘deranged immune system’ we call it,” LeConte says. “But that may mean immunotherapy, which is potentially curative therapy for many people with cancer — even stage 4 cancer sometimes — will not work as well.” LeConte understands people don’t make all their decisions based on cancer risk. “But we would like people to at least be aware that alcohol is a carcinogen so that they can incorporate that in their decision-making,” she says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eye-changes-with-age/,"How Your Eyes Change With Age Some vision issues are normal; others may be signs of trouble By Hallie Levine, AARP Comments En español Published January 07, 2019 Clickt to get to the audio version so you can listen on Audible free. Getting started Like crow’s feet and graying hair, changes to our eyes are inevitable as we age. But while some age-related eye issues — such as needing reading glasses — are harmless, others, like cataracts, can impact your vision (or worse) and need to be diagnosed and treated. Here, a look at the most common age-related conditions, and three symptoms that may be signs of more serious eye-health issues. Presbyopia While you’re still in your 40s, the lens in your eye begins to lose flexibility, making it hard to read up close or small print. “It’s very disconcerting for a lot of people, because it’s the first sign that they’re getting older,” says Sumayya Ahmad, assistant professor of ophthalmology at Mount Sinai Hospital’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. You may notice that you’re holding reading material at arm’s length, or that you have trouble reading the menu in a dimly lit restaurant. If presbyopia’s your only vision problem (meaning you don’t otherwise use contact lenses or glasses) then all you need to do is don a pair of reading glasses, says Michelle Andreoli, an ophthalmologist at the Wheaton Eye Clinic outside Chicago and a clinical spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. But if you already wear specs, you’ll need to switch your lenses to bifocals, in which the top of the lens is corrected to treat distance vision, while the bottom helps you see things close up; or opt for progressive lenses, which have gradual focal changes. If you wear contacts, you have two options: monovision lenses, which correct one eye for seeing at a distance and the other for close-up vision, and multifocal lenses, in which different parts of the lens are set at different powers. Floaters. These small spots in your field of vision are actually specks or threads of protein that can form, as you age, in the vitreous, the gel-like fluid in the space between the eye’s lens and retina. If you see them occasionally, and they disappear after a few minutes, you don’t need to worry. But if a large number suddenly appear and/or they’re accompanied by flashes of light or vision loss, see your doctor immediately or head to the ER as it could be a sight-threatening retinal detachment. As you get older it can become harder to distinguish between an object and its background. iStock/Sarah Peng/AARP Loss of contrast sensitivity At around age 60, you may start noticing that it’s harder to drive at night or in fog, or, conversely, to adjust from going from a dark backyard into a bright kitchen. These are all due to decreased contrast sensitivity, says Andreoli, which makes it hard to distinguish between an object and its background. This is because your eye’s rod cells, which help you see in dim light, degrade with age. The best way to combat this, at least during the day, is to wear a pair of over-the-counter sunglasses tinted orange, yellow or amber to enhance contrast, Andreoli says. But be wary of using these at night, since they can reduce the amount of light entering the eye and thus make it harder to see in the dark. If you’re experiencing a lot of trouble driving at night, see your doctor; you may also have cataracts or dry eyes, which can make the contrast problem worse. Dry eye Up to 75 percent of adults over age 40 experience dry eye, a condition in which your eyes don’t produce enough tears. “As you get older, tear production slows, as do other glands around the eye that produce oil that also helps keep eyes moist,” explains Howard Krauss, a Los Angeles ophthalmologist. As a result, your eyes may sting, feel gritty or sometimes even tear excessively (it’s your eye’s natural response to irritation, Krauss notes). Women are more susceptible, especially as plunging hormone levels during menopause affect the eye’s tear production (although it’s unclear exactly how or why). See our guide for information on treating dry eye. Floaters. These small spots in your field of vision are actually specks or threads of protein that can form, as you age, in the vitreous, the gel-like fluid in the space between the eye’s lens and retina. If you see them occasionally, and they disappear after a few minutes, you don’t need to worry. But if a large number suddenly appear and/or they’re accompanied by flashes of light or vision loss, see your doctor immediately or head to the ER as it could be a sight-threatening retinal detachment. As you get older it can become harder to distinguish between an object and its background. iStock/Sarah Peng/AARP Cataracts By age 80, more than half of all Americans have had a cataract — a clouding of the lens in the eye — according to the National Eye Institute. You’re more at risk if you smoke or drink a lot of alcohol, have had a lot of UV exposure, or have diabetes (a 2018 study published in the medical journal Eye found that it nearly doubles the risk of getting a cataract). “People usually complain of blurry vision, first at a distance, then up close — they can’t see the TV, they have trouble reading books, and they may find it hard to drive,” Andreoli says. If cataract symptoms are mild, you may not need to do more than get a new eyeglass prescription to help you see better. But if you’re having trouble with day-to-day activities, then you’ll need surgery, where your ophthalmologist replaces your cloudy lens with a new, artificial one. Learn more about cataracts and how to treat them. Three red flags for potential eye disease or damage People between the ages of 55 and 64 should have a comprehensive eye exam every one to three years, and then every one to two years after age 65, even if they have no symptoms, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This allows your doctor to screen you for potentially sight-stealing conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and cataracts. But if you notice any of these three signs, see your eye doctor right away. A small blurred area near the center of your vision. This can be a sign of age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease that causes damage to the retina.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2024/updated-covid-vaccines-approved.html,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by 7 Things to Know About the New COVID Vaccines FDA approves updated coronavirus shots for 2024-2025 By Rachel Nania, Updated October 24, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published August 22, 2024 / Updated October 24, 2024 AARP (Getty Images (2)) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed off on updated versions of coronavirus vaccine that target a more recent variant of the virus that was behind this summer’s surge in COVID-19 cases. The new shots — one from Moderna﻿, another from Pfizer/BioNTech and a third from Novavax — are available at pharmacies and doctors’ offices across the country﻿, and infectious disease experts hope the reformulated vaccines will help to keep cases from swelling this fall and winter. Here are seven things you need to know about the updated COVID-19 vaccines. 1. The mRNA vaccines target a FLiRT variant During the summer, the FDA recommended that vaccine manufacturers target the KP.2 coronavirus strain in the 2024-2025 COVID vaccines. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. At the time, KP.2, a member of the FLiRT variant family and a descendant of omicron, was behind a large share of increasing infections in the U.S. Though this particular strain is no longer among the top circulating variants, its close relatives are, and health experts expect that the updated vaccines will provide strong protection against them as well. The FLiRT variants all came from the same parent strain, explains Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. “And there are very, very minimal mutational changes between all of them.” 2. Another shot can restore waning immunity It’s not just about making sure we have a vaccine that targets the most recent versions of the virus, Guest says. It’s also about restoring faded immunity. Paying for a COVID vaccine ﻿ Most people with Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance can get an updated COVID vaccine at no cost through their health plans, the CDC says. Health officials urge individuals without insurance to contact their state or local health department for information about free vaccines, now that the national Bridge Access Program has ended. You can find a directory of state and local health departments on the CDC’s website. “We know that immunity from this vaccine diminishes over time,” she says, so the vaccine you received last year isn’t providing you with optimal protection now. Though the summer surge has receded, around 1,000 Americans are still dying from the disease each week, the latest data from the week of Sept. 21 shows. “I think the population would like to put the pandemic in the rearview mirror and not really think about it anymore. But the virus is still very much with us and still continues to cause problems,” says Mark Rupp, M.D., a professor and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The vast majority of COVID hospitalizations that occurred from October 2023 to March 2024 were among individuals who were not vaccinated or not up to date on their vaccinations, according to data presented at a meeting of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory committee.

You can find a directory of state and local health departments on the CDC’s website. 3. Vaccines can reduce the risk of long COVID Who will get the COVID vaccine? According to recent findings from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, 45 percent of adults age 50-plus plan to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall. A few other findings: 59 percent of adults age 75 and older plan to get the vaccine. 51 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 plan to get the vaccine. 37 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 plan to get the vaccine. Beyond restoring protection from a short-term illness, the CDC says, the vaccines can reduce the likelihood “of suffering the effects of long COVID,” which has impacted an estimated 17 million U.S. adults, according to a report from the health policy nonprofit KFF. Long COVID — marked by symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, headaches and joint and muscle pain — can creep in after a coronavirus infection clears and last for months, even years. Symptoms can be so severe for some people that they can result in a disability, the CDC says. “That risk of long COVID is there and it’s real, and it can be minimized by getting vaccinated,” Rupp says. 4. Virtually everyone should get new vaccine The CDC recommended that everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID vaccination once it’s available. “It’s really important that everyone get this vaccine; it is even more important than anyone 60 and older get it,” Guest says. “And we just can't stress enough that the majority of the severe complications from COVID-19, and unfortunately the fact that we still have deaths … they’re more likely to be among people who are older than 60. And so getting this is really important to protect them from consequences like that.” If you’re 65 and older, plan to go back in the spring for a second shot. On Oct. 23, the CDC issued a recommendation for people 65-plus and those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised to receive a second dose of 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine six months after their first dose. Who will get the COVID vaccine? According to recent findings from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, 45 percent of adults age 50-plus plan to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall. A few other findings: 59 percent of adults age 75 and older plan to get the vaccine. 51 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 plan to get the vaccine. 37 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 plan to get the vaccine. “For the past several years at least, we've had two increases of COVID a year. There's a summer increase, and then it abates, and then we have another, and usually larger, winter increase,” says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. “And we know that the COVID vaccines provide good protection in the short-term, but by the time you get to month four, five and six, that protection begins to wane.” The idea is a second shot in the spring can protect older adults through the summer surge, until an updated vaccine is released in the fall, he explains. 5. The (mostly mild) side effects remain the same Not everyone experiences side effects after vaccination, but some people do, and the FDA says for those individuals, there are no surprises with the updated vaccines. Common side effects can include: Pain, swelling and redness at the injection site FatigueHeadacheMuscle painChillsNauseaFever Side effects tend to be mild and generally go away in a few days, the CDC says. “These updated vaccines meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality,” Peter Marks, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. 6. You can get your COVID and flu shots at the same time If you’re looking to save time and an extra trip to the clinic, you can get your COVID vaccine and flu shot — even the RSV vaccine, too — at the same time. The optimal time to get the flu shot is September and October, the CDC says. Where you live may influence your decision on whether to pair up flu and COVID vaccines. “The northern half of the country tends to see the flu season start close to a month earlier than the southern part of the country,” Guest says. “And so in the northern states, I would not even consider waiting. I would go ahead and get both if they were available. If they are not available for some reason, and only COVID is, I would get the COVID [vaccine now] and then go back [for your flu shot].” 7. An updated vaccine from Novavax is authorized Novavax’s vaccine — which uses a more traditional (protein-based) technology from the mRNA vaccines — was authorized by the FDA on Aug. 30 for individuals 12 and older. Instead of targeting the KP.2 variant, Novavax’s 2024-2025 vaccine targets JN.1, which the company describes as “the ‘parent strain’ of currently circulating variants.” It’s expected to provide strong protection from the variants that are spreading, Rupp says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/reusable-water-bottle-mold-sickness/,"Is Your Water Bottle Making You Sick? Here’s what germs could be lurking inside﻿ — plus, how to clean it properly By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published March 20, 2024 Photo Illustration: AARP; (Source: Getty Images) Reusable water bottles are all the rage these days — no doubt a boon for the environment and our hydration levels. But if you’re not cleaning your glass, stainless steel or plastic bottle, that must-have accessory could be a potential health hazard. “Just like any other surface where water accumulates, spores can drop and start forming mold,” says Benjamin Turner, an instructor in the Department of Biology at ﻿The University of Alabama at Birmingham. Mold, a type of fungus, spreads by way of microscopic reproductive cells, called spores, that waft through our indoor and outdoor air. They like to settle where there’s moisture. “That’s where the spores will incubate and start forming those black fuzzy or gray, white areas of mold patches,” Turner says. Some molds are harmless, but others can cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems. Still, S. Wesley Long, M.D., medical director of microbiology at Houston Methodist, says you’ll likely be deterred by an off-putting smell or taste before drinking enough to make you sick. “But certainly for some people, especially the immunocompromised, they need to be more careful,” Long says. Bacteria can also grow in your bottle. In fact, your mouth has one of the highest concentrations of microbes ﻿— tiny living organisms including bacteria, fungi and viruses ﻿— in the body, says Peter Iwen, a professor and microbiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. These various germs can transfer to the bottle and “produce a substance that allows them to clump together,” called a biofilm. “And then you have this slimy biofilm that forms on your bottles,” Iwen explains. This biofilm likely won’t get you sick since the germs came from your mouth. But it could get someone else sick if they take a swig of your drink — especially if you’re harboring a virus like COVID-19, influenza or norovirus. “Sharing it with other people is a risk because your flora [the population of microbes in your body] is not necessarily applicable to that next person that might be drinking from that bottle,” Iwen says. ﻿ Pouring anything with sugar into your bottle — a sports drink, for example — only adds fuel to the fire by supplying “a rich source to promote bacterial and fungal growth,” Long says. Getty Images How to wash your water bottle How do you prevent mold and other microbes from moving in and taking over? Cleaning your water bottle every day — or every couple of days — with hot water and soap is a good place to start. Iwen also recommends sanitizing your bottle every week to 10 days. You can either run it through the dishwasher or soak it in a vinegar solution. “Take about one part vinegar to about three or four parts water﻿, and just let the bottle soak in that for maybe five minutes,” Iwen says. Rinse it off with hot water and soap, and you’re good to go. If your bottle is equipped with seals, straws or silicone mouthpieces, you’ll want to disassemble those and give them a good wash and soak, too. “Rubber, for instance, is a good area for bacteria to form these biofilms. So you should be taking it apart,” Iwen says. ﻿Inexpensive, specially designed brushes are even sold to help clean the often-neglected inside of straws. “Pay attention to the nooks and crannies where substances can sort of get lodged and take hold and get missed in a superficial cleaning,” Long says. If a sugary drink was in your bottle, make sure it didn’t leave behind a dried, sticky residue. “That’s just a great medium for bacterial and fungal growth,” Long adds. Just as important as washing the bottle is drying it properly. Think of what happens to your lawn after a good rain, Turner says. “Mushrooms form, and mold is a fungus﻿, and so it’s just waiting for the right environment. It needs oxygen and water and a little warm temperature. So if you can dry things out, that’s probably the number one thing you can do to avoid mold and mildew growth,” he says. A few other tips: Buy easy-to-clean bottles. On the hunt for a new bottle? If you’re looking for a low-maintenance option, Iwen recommends a stainless steel bottle with a wide mouthpiece. They’re easier to clean, plus, he says, biofilms form easier on plastic. Keep your bottle with you. We’re all guilty of occasionally leaving our coffee mugs and water bottles in the car, but don’t make a habit out of it — especially if it’s warm outside. “Bacteria love to grow in that kind of environment,” Iwen says. The advice is the same for storing your bottle on your desk at work or in your gym bag for your next workout. Don’t refill disposable bottles. “They weren’t designed to be used over and over again,” Iwen says. The plastic can break down quickly, making it easier for bacteria to take over.

Not necessarily. To be sure, salty chips, frozen pizza, and sugary sodas and cereals aren’t nutritional all-stars. In fact, more than 70 percent of the sodium in the typical American diet comes from packaged and prepared foods, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Americans love their processed foods. A recent study by the NYU School of Global Public Health found that ultra-processed food consumption has risen across nearly every segment of the U.S. population over the past 20 years and may be a big contributor to the obesity epidemic. And, according to a 2023 report from the National Poll on Healthy Aging at the University of Michigan, about 13 percent of people ages 50 to 80 — especially women and those who are lonely, overweight or in fair or poor health — are actually addicted to processed foods. That’s a concern because recent studies have linked highly processed foods to a greater overall risk of cancer (especially breast and ovarian cancer), dementia, ﻿type﻿ 2 diabetes and heart disease. But there are plenty of healthy options — if you’re choosy and make it a habit to read ingredient lists. What is a processed food? Remember, not all processed foods are alike. According to the Department of Agriculture, processed foods are any raw agricultural commodities that have been altered from their original state. That can include cutting, drying, freezing, pasteurizing or packaging. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics places these foods on a continuum, says Nancy Farrell Allen, an Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics registered dietitian: Those that are minimally processed, like bagged spinach, eggs, oats, pasta and plain roasted nuts; those processed at their peak, like canned tomatoes, tuna, frozen fruit and freshly made bread; and ultra-processed foods (in which culinary ingredients or food additives are included for taste or convenience), like flavored yogurts, salad dressings, packaged crackers/cookies, chips, deli meat, soy burgers, ready-to-eat meals, frozen pizza and soft drinks. That last group is the one many doctors and researchers say you should avoid. Keep those guidelines in mind the next time you’re at the grocery, and fill your cart with these 25 good-for-you processed foods. 1. Dairy, soy milk or filtered milk Yes, milk is processed (hello, Louis Pasteur!), but that’s a good thing. “I’m an advocate for dairy milk. It’s natural, and it provides roughly a dozen nutrients and antioxidants that nourish and heal our bodies,” says Farrell Allen. As for soy milk, “It’s similar in protein content to cow’s milk and is usually fortified with vitamin D and calcium,” says Stephanie Crabtree, a longevity dietitian and owner of Florida-based Holistic Health RD. One caveat: Look for organic soy milk, with no sugar or artificial sweeteners. A third option that is healthy for older adults is ultra-filtered milk, which has more concentrated protein and less or no lactose, says Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the Mayo Clinic. 2. Greek yogurt “Greek yogurt contains probiotics that support gut health, protein to support muscle repair and calcium for bone health,” says Cassandra Burke, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Catalyst Performance Lab in Finksburg, Maryland. Some research has shown that probiotics may help cognitive function, elevate mood and lower anxiety. But choose plain Greek yogurt over a sugary, flavored variety — that’s like eating a candy bar! Greek yogurt is a great swap for sour cream in burrito bowls and is a yummy snack topped with fruit (for fiber) or walnuts (for a dose of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids), Farrell Allen says. 3. Precut veggies We might not have liked it when Mom told us to eat our veggies — but she knew best. “Precut vegetables can be a game-changer for some seniors,” says Stacey Woodson, a Philadelphia-based registered dietitian. “They are an excellent choice for those with limited mobility as they remove the need for chopping and make it easier to incorporate essential nutrients into daily meals.” Veggies give a quick hit of fiber, vitamins and antioxidants, says Alyssa Simpson, a registered dietitian and certified gastrointestinal nutritionist in Phoenix. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, vegetables (particularly dark-green leafy, cruciferous or deep-yellow or orange ones) protect against heart disease, COPD, diverticulosis, cataracts and possibly stroke. Add precut carrots, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and other vegetables into stir-fries, soups, lunch boxes or veggie trays — or simply season and roast. 4. Packaged salads Need another weekday time-saver from the produce aisle? Packaged salads might be just the ticket. “Prewashed greens hit the mark as a shortcut for getting more veggies in your diet,” Burke says. “A balanced diet containing fiber-rich vegetables not only helps reduce the risk of heart disease but also helps us maintain a healthy weight.” Skip the toppings and dressing included in the packages and add some grilled chicken or canned tuna and a low-sugar vinaigrette for a quick, nutrient-dense meal. Beans are a great source of both fiber and protein. Sam Island 5. Canned beans “Beans are loaded with plant-based protein and essential minerals like iron and magnesium, supporting heart and gut health,” Simpson says. Look for low-sodium versions, or rinse beans in water for a few seconds — doing so can reduce the sodium by 40 percent, says Christine Rosenbloom, registered dietitian and nutritionist, and author of A to Z Blog: Simple, Practical, Science-Based Tips for a Long, Healthy Life. “Beans are a fantastic source of dietary fiber, with about 15 to 20 grams in half a cup,” says Jennifer House, a registered dietitian in Alberta, Canada. “High intake of fiber can lower blood cholesterol levels and protect against colon cancer and ﻿type 2 diabetes.” Add beans to soups, salads, bowls and tacos to keep you feeling satisfied. 6. Frozen or canned fish The American Heart Association recommends consuming two 3-ounce seafood servings (preferably fatty fish like salmon, herring, mackerel, bluefin tuna and mussels) a week. Unless you’re bagging your own trout, frozen fish (usually frozen on boats right after the catch) can be as good as fresh. “Frozen or canned fish is an excellent source of high-quality protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which support heart and joint health,” Simpson says. According to the FDA, the healthiest seafood, canned or otherwise, in terms of mercury levels includes anchovies, clams, haddock, flounder, oysters, tilapia, shrimp, scallops and canned light tuna. (If you have questions about specific fish species, check out FDA.gov/fishadvice.) Look for plain varieties that have no (or reduced salt) and no breading or sauces; canned fish in water has a lower fat content and fewer calories, if that is a concern. Use them in fish tacos, casseroles, meat salads or as a topping on veggie salads. Beans are a great source of both fiber and protein. Sam Island 7. Nuts and seeds “Nuts and seeds are high in unsaturated fat, fiber, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals,” House says. “While they are nutrient-dense, they are also calorie-dense, so don’t munch on an open bag; take out a handful (about ⅓ cup) at a time for snacking.” Nuts have also been shown to help prevent weight gain and provide other heart-healthy benefits, according to the American Heart Association. In December, the FDA updated labeling criteria and said manufacture﻿rs can now call nuts and seeds healthy. You can blend seeds like hemp hearts, flax seeds or chia seeds into smoothies, sprinkle chopped walnuts or pumpkin seeds on yogurt, or top salads with pistachios. Look for unsalted versions if high blood pressure is a concern. 8. Peanut butter or other nut butters “Ground up into ‘butter,’ nuts and seeds provide healthy fats to support hormones, brain health and hunger cues,” says Kaytee Hadley, a functional medicine dietitian and founder of Holistic Health and Wellness in Richmond, Virginia. They also provide protein and vitamin E and are great for older Americans dealing with a lower appetite or difficulty chewing hard foods, Woodson says. Choose varieties of peanut butter, almond butter, sunflower seed butter and cashew butter with no added sugars, hydrogenated oils or excessive salt, and enjoy them on whole-grain toast, in oatmeal or blended into smoothies, Simpson says. 9. Tofu “Tofu is one of the most versatile and nutritionally dense foods,” Hadley says. “I always recommend it to meat eaters and vegans alike because it’s packed with high-quality plant-based protein, calcium and brain-supporting choline.” Are there any caveats? “Despite common misconceptions, eating soy foods like tofu has been linked to lower rates of certain cancers﻿, does not disrupt hormone levels in men and can even have a positive impact on women’s hormones,” she says. Use tofu as a replacement for meat and season to add flavor (tofu itself is bland). Remove skin to make a rotisserie chicken healthier. Sam Island 10. Rotisserie chicken “This is a convenient, protein-rich option that supports muscle maintenance and makes meal prep easy,” Simpson says. To keep it healthier, remove the skin to reduce sodium and saturated fat. Shred the chicken into salads, soups or grain bowls for a quick and versatile meal. 11. Frozen fruits and veggies Frozen fruits such as brain-boosting blueberries are great in the winter. “Most are picked in the field and frozen right away,” locking in their nutrients and flavor, Rosenbloom says. “Fruits and vegetables are loaded with important vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber, which are imperative for good health and preventing deficiencies,” says Woodson. “They are budget-friendly options that last for months in the freezer, making nutritious eating more accessible for seniors. Their pre-cut nature and easy portioning help prevent food waste while eliminating the need for difficult chopping.” That’s a huge win, considering fruit’s proven benefit on our physical health (potentially helping ward off breast cancer, improving heart health and lowering blood pressure) and its ability to act as a mood booster. 12. Cottage cheese “Cottage cheese is making such a comeback, especially the low-fat, 1﻿-percent version, for the protein, calcium and vitamin D it offers,” Farrell Allen says. Choose varieties labeled “low sodium” or “no salt added,” Burke says. You can also look for cottage cheese containing live cultures to benefit gut health. Top with fruit or nuts as a sweet meal, add cottage cheese (plus salsa!) to a baked potato for a savory meal, use it in a dip, or make cottage cheese “chips” to snack on (bake a couple tablespoons of cottage cheese with a favorite topping, like herbs or minced onion), House says. 13. Whole-grain brown rice “Loaded with B vitamins and fiber, brown rice is a complex carbohydrate that provides energy to power you through the day and your workouts,” Burke says. A 2024 Danish study of almost 50,000 men and women found that eating whole grains extended life expectancy. “Stick with plain brown rice and season it with dried herbs and spices; packaged and pre-seasoned varieties often contain added sodium.” Pair brown rice (which has more beneficial nutrients than white rice, Haley says ) with your favorite lean protein (like chicken, fish, or tofu) and some roasted or stir-fried vegetables for an easy grain bowl. Or top a base of brown rice with eggs and vegetables for a savory balanced breakfast. 14. Hummus “Hummus is a nutrient-dense, protein-packed food that’s﻿ perfect for older adults who desire simple food choices that support their nutritional needs,” Woodson says. “Its smooth, creamy texture makes it great to use as a dip while providing essential fiber, protein and necessary fats in a form that's gentle on aging digestive systems.” Hummus can be a great substitute for mayonnaise on sandwiches, pairs well with ground chicken meatballs, cucumbers and pita for a Greek-inspired wrap, or can be thinned out with lemon juice and water for a low-sugar salad dressing, Burke says. But read labels on store-bought hummus to check for unhealthy additives. The fewer ingredients, the better. To make healthy, delicious popcorn, pop it on the stovetop. Sam Island 15. Popcorn Remember when we popped our own popcorn on the stovetop as kids? You still can! Just add healthy seasonings (like a bit of salt and a dash of flavorful cayenne or nutritional yeast) for a great fiber-filled﻿, on-the-go or after-dinner snack, Zeratsky says. The hulls of popcorn, another natural unprocessed whole grain, are high in polyphenols and fiber. If you go with microwave popcorn, look closely at the nutritional label before you pop, pop, pop your nutrition to smithereens. 16. Mozzarella sticks “These are a good source of both protein and calcium, which is important for bone density as we age,” says Jordan Hill, lead registered dietitian for Top Nutrition Coaching and owner of Hill Health Nutrition in Denver. “The typical recommendation is three servings a day of calcium,” and cheese sticks are a relatively inexpensive (and snackable!) way to get one serving. Why is protein needed? Because we lose muscle mass as we age, Hill says, and our appetites start to decline, so we may be protein deficient. The Mayo Clinic says that calcium not only helps us maintain strong bones (to help prevent osteopenia and osteoporosis) but also benefits your heart and nerves.﻿﻿﻿ Remove skin to make a rotisserie chicken healthier. Sam Island To make healthy, delicious popcorn, pop it on the stovetop. Sam Island ﻿17. Sauerkraut “Sauerkraut is rich in probiotics that support gut health and provides vitamins like C and K,” Simpson says. It is also rich in fiber and antioxidants, which may protect against inflammatory diseases, the leading cause of death worldwide. “But it’s important to choose fresh, refrigerated options without added sugars, preservatives or vinegar, as vinegar indicates it wasn’t properly fermented to produce probiotics.” Add it as a tangy topping to sandwiches, salads or grain bowls for a boost of flavor and beneficial bacteria. 18. Chickpea or lentil pastas Looking to swap your standard noodles for something a little healthier and heartier? “Chickpea or lentil pasta is a nutritious option for those over 50, providing plant-based protein and significantly more fiber than regular pasta to support muscle health and digestion,” Simpson says. However, she advises, “Due to the high fiber content, it’s essential to start with smaller portions to avoid digestive discomfort, especially if you’re not used to high-fiber foods.” And check the ingredient list, Farrell Allen says. Some chickpea pastas contain stabilizers, so ask your dietitian for healthy suggestions. Either enjoy pasta with a simple olive oil and garlic sauce or toss it with roasted vegetables for a nutrient- and protein-packed meal. 19. Dried fruit “Dried fruit is high in fiber and antioxidants,” House says. “Prunes are known best for their gut health effects — relieving constipation — but also can help prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women, possibly due to polyphenols, vitamin K and potassium.” Adds Farrell Allen: “All dried fruits provide a concentrated source of sweetness along with vitamins/minerals such as potassium, magnesium and iron.” But it can be easy to overeat dried fruit, which has concentrated natural sugars that can stick to your teeth, says House, so stick to a ¼ cup serving of plain dried fruit or mix it into trail mix or granola. Choose cereals with whole grains and fewer additives. Sam Island 20. Cereal “Cereals have gotten a bad rap because of artificial colors and added sugar, but not all cereals are created equal,” Hadley says. “Whole-grain cereals without those additives make a delicious and healthy breakfast that you can prepare with fruit, or top with an egg and mushrooms.” (The Center or Science in the Public Interest has a database that rates food additives from ""safe"" to ""avoid."") All grains in the U.S. are fortified with B vitamins and iron, Farrell Allen says. And whole grains are high in fiber and plant phytochemicals that act as antioxidants in the body, House says. A 2023 analysis found that eating cereal is linked to a lower risk of obesity compared with other breakfasts or skipping breakfast. A few healthy cereal options to get you started: Cheerios, Bob’s Red Mill 10 grain hot cereal or Great River Milling’s Hot Cereal. 21. Protein powders “If you’re struggling to get enough protein, it helps to have a convenient option like a protein powder,” Hill says. “You can blend it with fresh fruit or veggies like cauliflower or spinach in a smoothie, or add it to oatmeal or yogurt.” But she adds a couple of caveats: Protein powders (some flavored, some not) are meant as a supplement, not to replace something in your diet, and it’s important to make sure the powder has undergone third-party testing for added sugar and chemicals; look for logos from third-party certifying organizations (like Aegis, NSF, Informed Choice or BSCG) or ask your dietitian for suggestions. 22. Edamame, frozen or dried “Edamame is a legume and a soy product, and it’s high in protein,” Hill says. It’s also full of B vitamins, fiber, potassium and magnesium. Find it in the freezer aisle and microwave or boil it for a quick side or snack. On the road? Pack an edamame snack pack — “it’s just like having dried fruit,” Hill says. Look for low- or no-salt varieties, and either eat as a snack or toss into soups, stir-fries or salads. 23. Tomato sauce — but check that label! “Moms used to make this from scratch,” Farrell Allen says, “but jarred sauce provides ease at mealtimes.” These bottled sauces — make sure they’re low in sugar and salt —“allow us the benefits of tomatoes year round — think lycopene, ﻿v﻿vitamin C and carotenoids, which help lower inflammation and decrease the risk of heart, skin and eye diseases.” Processed tomato products such as tomato juice and canned tomatoes have more lycopene than fresh. This nutrient has been found to help lower blood pressure and protect against prostate cancer. And if you’re mad about tomatoes, a healthy warm-weather option is salsa (without additives, so look for those in the refrigerated section of your grocery), Zeratsky says. 24. Kombucha and kefir Kombucha, a fermented tea beverage, and kefir, a fermented milk, contain live probiotics, which help populate healthy gut bacteria. “Our gut talks to our brain,” Hill says, “and when our gut is healthy, it has positive impacts on our mood, how we digest food and how our immune system runs. It’s called the second brain for good reason.” A 2023 study indicated that kombucha may lower blood sugar levels in people with ﻿type﻿ 2 diabetes. Just make sure you get kombucha or kefir that is not loaded with extra sugar and other additives. 25. Olive oil The monounsaturated fat found in olive oil, a mainstay of the healthy Mediterranean diet, helps decrease heart disease and inflammation that occurs in many chronic diseases, like diabetes, high blood fat levels and some cancers. And a 2024 study of more than 90,000 adults reported in JAMA Network Open found that consuming ﻿7 grams or more a day of olive oil lowered the risk of dementia-related death by 28 percent. The new FDA rules also allow olive oil to be called healthy by manufacture﻿rs. Opt for extra﻿-virgin varieties, which retain more nutrients. Use olive oil for sautéing, drizzling over salads or as a dip for whole-grain bread. And a bonus option: Pureed pumpkin This is a great source of ﻿vitamin A and flavor — but be sure you get pure pumpkin and not pumpkin pie filling, Zeratsky says. She suggests stirring it into hot cereal, plain yogurt, a smoothie, casseroles, soups or mac and cheese — or even using it as the filling in homemade ravioli. Choose cereals with whole grains and fewer additives.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/safe-sunscreen/,"Extreme Heat View Series 7 Expert Tips for Choosing the Right Sunscreen Here’s what you need to know to select sun protection that’s healthy for you and good for the planet By Michelle Crouch, Updated May 30, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published May 12, 2022 / Updated May 30, 2023 You probably already know that using sunscreen regularly can slash your risk of skin cancer, reduce wrinkles and slow the effects of aging. But recent concerns about sunscreen ingredients have made it more difficult than it used to be to choose a safe sunscreen. The Environmental Working Group (EWG), a nonprofit advocacy organization, says about 75 percent of sunscreens on the market provide inferior sun protection or have worrisome ingredients. Studies also show that some sunscreens may cause damage to oceans and coral reefs. A growing number of destinations, including Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have banned sunscreens with certain chemicals. While more research is needed to prove whether sunscreen ingredients are harmful, the concerns have left many Americans with questions about sunscreen safety and uncertain about which products to purchase. What’s important, experts say, is not to let those concerns stop you from using sunscreen altogether, because there’s no doubt that leaving your skin unprotected puts you at greater risk of skin cancer. A Guide to Better Skin After 50 Have healthy looking skin at any age Tips, advice and resources Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U﻿n﻿i﻿t﻿e﻿d﻿ States, and about 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. Both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers have been rising in recent decades. While melanoma accounts for only 1 percent of all skin cancers diagnosed in the U.S., it is the deadliest. “Any sunscreen is better than none,” says Mona Gohara, an associate clinical professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine and a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). “We know that the sun can you give you cancer. There is thus far no proven data that says sunscreens can give you cancer.” Can sunscreen ingredients harm your health? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a few years ago decided to reevaluate the safety data on sunscreen ingredients. After an extended clinical study, the agency found that some commonly used sunscreen chemicals — avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate and octinoxate — can seep through your skin and into your bloodstream. The study found that even after a single application, the chemicals remain in your body for an extended period. But the fact that those chemicals get into your blood doesn’t necessarily mean those ingredients are harmful, says David Fivenson, an immunologist and dermatologist in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Some laboratory-based studies indicate that chemical ingredients could interfere with the normal function of the body’s hormonal system, affect infant development or cause other health issues. But Five﻿nson notes, “there has never been good, practical evidence of harm in a realistic study of people.” If there’s one ingredient to avoid, it’s probably oxybenzone, says Tasneem Mohammad, senior staff physician in the department of dermatology at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. “In a lot of areas of the world, like Europe, it’s not really used anymore,” Mohammad says. Here, he and other dermatologists offer 7 more tips for choosing a sunscreen this summer: 1. Consider a mineral-based sunscreen If you are concerned about health effects, the safest choice is a so-called “mineral” or “physical” sunscreen with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, dermatologists say. Those are the only sunscreen ingredients that the FDA says are “generally recognized as safe and effective.” Mineral sunscreens also cause fewer skin reactions compared to those that rely on chemicals. While chemical sunscreens act like sponges and absorb ultraviolet light, “a physical sunscreen acts like a shield,” Gohara explains. It sits on top of your skin and deflects UVA and UVB rays away from your body. 2. Check to see if it’s reef-safe Lab research shows some chemical sunscreen ingredients can be toxic to coral and other marine organisms, says Fivenson, who is a cofounder of an American Academy of Dermatology group that examines environmental issues. However, the true impact is unclear because the concentrations of chemicals used in some studies were as much as 1,000 times higher than the amount in most real-world environments, he says. If you are concerned about the environment or traveling to a place that bans certain chemicals, look for sunscreens labeled “reef-safe” or “reef-friendly.” Keep in mind, however, that those terms are not regulated by the FDA, Fivenson says. So you should also check the ingredients to ensure they don’t contain oxybenzone or octinoxate — the chemicals most often banned because of their detrimental effect on marine life. 3. Choose an SPF of at least 30 Short for “sun protection factor,” SPF is a measure of a product’s ability to protect you from the sun’s UVB rays, which cause sunburn. Choose a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, which blocks 97 percent of the sun’s UVB rays. SPFs over 30 are only slightly more effective, so don’t let sky-high SPFs lull you into thinking you are totally protected from sun damage. 4. Look for “broad spectrum” Sunscreens that are labeled “broad spectrum” will ensure you are protected against UVB rays, which cause sunburn, and also from UVA rays, which cause wrinkles and aging. UVA rays also contribute to skin cancer. (Note: EWG testing found that many sunscreens labeled as “broad spectrum” do not protect as well as promised against UVA and UVB rays.) 5. Beware of sprays Although sunscreen sprays are easy to use, many dermatologists don’t recommend them. For one thing, there’s a risk of lung irritation or damage if you inhale it. Never spray it near your face. In addition, getting adequate coverage can be tricky. “It’s tough to get even product application, and a lot of sunscreen gets blown away by the wind,” Mohammad says. If you do decide to use a spray, apply it outside or in a well-ventilated room, and rub it in by hand to ensure a more even application. 6. Look for targeted formulas if you have darker skin Even those with darker skin tones need daily protection. The problem is, some sunscreens — especially mineral-based ones — leave people of color looking ashy. “The sunscreen industry has risen to the occasion and formulated tinted sunscreens that don’t look chalky on darker-skinned individuals,” says Allison T. Vidimos, a board-certified dermatologist and chair of the Department of Dermatology at the Cleveland Clinic. Top Sunscreen Picks Still struggling to pick a product? For its 202﻿3 Guide to Sunscreens, the Environmental Working Group rated the safety and efficacy of 1,﻿7﻿0﻿0﻿ products advertising sun protection and published a list of 2﻿3﻿﻿3 sunscreens that meet its standards. Instead of skipping protection altogether, look for formulas that use micronized particles or tints to minimize chalkiness, Vidimos says. 7. Apply properly One study found that people apply only about 20 to 50 percent of the amount of sunscreen they need to achieve the amount of SPF on the label. To get full protection, most adults need about one ounce — or enough to fill a shot glass — to fully cover their entire body. “For your entire body, use a teaspoon on your face and neck, two teaspoons on your trunk, one on each arm, and two on each leg,” Vidimos says. “That gives you the labeled amount of protection. Most people put on a quarter to a half of what they should put on.” Reapply every two hours or after swimming, and don’t forget your back, neck, face, ears and the tops of your feet.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/voice-changes-with-age/,"Why Your Voice Changes as You Age Age-related changes can impact how you sound — and some adults are more affected than others By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments Published January 22, 2025 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (2)) One of Michelle Adessa’s patients was a couple of years into retirement when he noticed a change in his voice. For seemingly no reason, it had become breathy and hoarse — something the 71-year-old hadn’t experienced over the course of his career in sales and marketing, recalls Adessa, a speech pathologist with the Cleveland Clinic’s Voice Center. He couldn’t help but notice it had gotten progressively worse in the six months since his wife died and he’d begun living alone. Increasingly self-conscious, the patient began to withdraw socially. He stopped doing his regular readings at church and singing in the church choir; he begged off his weekly get-togethers at the local diner because friends, many of whom wore hearing aids, couldn’t hear him when he spoke. By the time he went in search of a diagnosis — at the urging of his family — he was sure he had somehow done permanent damage to his voice. Turns out, he had a common, treatable condition called presbyphonia, or “aging voice.” Similar to how your abs, glutes, biceps and other muscles require regular exercise to stay strong, so do the muscles in your voice. The vocal cords, also known as vocal folds, “are essentially muscle covered in vibratory tissue,” Adessa explains. “As we age, our muscles become weaker, a process called sarcopenia. It affects the body at large, and also the muscles inside the vocal folds. As the vocal folds thin — or atrophy — they don’t touch in the middle and let air escape when you talk. This can make the voice sound raspy, weak or breathy.” That’s not the only factor at play. What’s known as respiratory drive — the intensity of your respiratory center’s output, which determines how much effort is required to breathe — “changes as we age, as does hearing,” Adessa says. “All of these changes can lead to the qualities that produce an aging voice.” What does an aging voice sound like? Besides breathiness and hoarseness, the symptoms of presbyphonia include lower volume and projection of your voice, difficulty being heard in noisy settings (like restaurants), a higher than normal pitch (if you’re a man), or lower (for women). Experts believe presbyphonia tends to go undiagnosed, so it’s difficult to know just how common aging voice is, but research suggests around 1 in 3 adults ages 60 and older have one or more of the symptoms above. And although the condition is rarely serious, it’s important to see a laryngologist or ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if symptoms continue, to rule out other medical conditions like GERD (short for gastroesophageal reflux), cancer of the larynx, or neurological diseases such as spasmodic dysphonia or vocal fold paralysis. “For example, a small tumor on the vocal folds can also produce raspiness. For that reason, anyone with voice changes that last longer than four weeks should see a doctor. This is particularly important for those with risk factors such as a history of smoking,” says Ted Mau, M.D., an otolaryngologist who specializes in voice disorders at UT Southwestern Medical Center. If the exam shows that the vocal cords/folds are thin, stiffened, or have a gap between them when they close, the diagnosis is typically presbyphonia. Treatment for an aging voice You might think talking less would be a good way to preserve your voice or treat an aging one. Just the opposite. Like any muscle, your voice needs to be exercised to stay strong. And while presbyphonia isn’t life-threatening, it “can impact your quality of life,” says Cristen Paige, a speech-language pathologist and senior clinician at Duke Voice Care Center. “People may ask you to repeat more often, which can be tiresome and frustrating. Sometimes you have to strain to be heard. You may also feel like you’re running out of air as you talk, which can be exhausting.” Mau adds that many older adults already experience social isolation, and voice problems “can really exacerbate that.” Voice therapy is considered the first-line treatment. Working with a speech pathologist, you’ll do vocal exercises that are designed to improve breathing, reduce straining when you speak and find the best pitch and volume. “While nothing can restore the vocal folds to their 25-year-old glory, voice therapy focuses on improving what already works well,” Paige says. “Speech pathologists individually tailor exercises that capitalize on good and efficient breath support. We help people strategize how they can best be heard, whether that’s over the phone, when out to dinner, or even just talking to a loved one at home.” But any use of your voice counts as exercise, Adessa adds. “Reading out loud to yourself or your grandchildren, talking on the phone, singing along to a song that you love on the radio — those are all ways to exercise the voice,” she says. “Maintaining good breath support is also essential. All the classic things we do for our health — such as cardiovascular exercise, getting enough sleep and reducing stress — can help to optimize breath support and vocal quality.” If therapy doesn’t help, your doctor may recommend injections to plump up the vocal cords (an in-office, half-hour procedure that offers a temporary fix) or voice box implants to stabilize the vocal cords (a surgery known as thyroplasty that provides a permanent solution). “Both work by restoring a fuller bulk and straighter edge to the vocal folds, so the voice can be smoother and stronger,” Mau says. As for Adessa’s patient, his voice improved after just three sessions of therapy. “He rejoined his choir and his weekly socializing at his local diner,” she says. “He now speaks with his daughter on the phone twice a week and even FaceTimes with his grandchildren so he can read to them.” Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/best-foods-for-constipation-relief/#comments_widget_id,"5 Foods to Relieve Constipation (Yes, Prunes Are #1) Irregularity is common in older adults, but the right foods can help jump-start your stool By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published June 15, 2023 Dusan Stankovic / Getty Images Can’t go? It may not make up for the bloating and bellyache, but if it’s any consolation, know that you’re not alone. About 16 percent of U.S. adults experience constipation, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). And when it comes to adults 60 and older, that percentage more than doubles. ﻿ What gives? “The GI (gastrointestinal) tract ages, just like the rest of a person’s body,” says William Chey, M.D., chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. Older adults also tend to take more medications than their younger peers, and many drugs and supplements can cause constipation, Chey adds. The good news is constipation can often be managed at home. Plenty of water and regular exercise can get — and keep — things moving. So can a few standout foods. Foods for constipation 1. Prunes Prunes are often hailed as the number one food to help you go number two — and for good reason. Prunes, which are just dehydrated plums, are packed with fiber, which helps keep food moving through the digestive system. They also contain the sugar alcohol sorbitol, which has a laxative effect, Chey explains. One study even found prunes to be more effective than psyllium (the active ingredient in Metamucil) for the treatment of mild to moderate constipation. Similarly, studies have found that prune juice is a safe and effective way to relieve constipation. There is a downside to prunes, however. They can cause gas and bloating — and the more you eat, the more likely you are to notice these effects, Chey says. 2. Kiwi Can’t deal with the unpleasant side effects from prunes? Grab a kiwi instead. Actually, make it two. A new study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that two kiwifruit a day helped to relieve constipation. Plus, research has shown that kiwi is better tolerated than prunes or psyllium, Chey says. 3. Oatmeal Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which helps to absorb water. Think of when you mix hot water into oatmeal and it starts to gel — that’s because of the soluble fiber, explains Ashley Baumohl, a registered dietitian in the division of gastroenterology at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. “Not only does [the fiber in oatmeal] help regulate your bowel movements, but it’s also actually softening them, making them easier to pass,” Baumohl says. Chia seeds — which also form a gel-like consistency when combined with water — is another example of a food high in soluble fiber. 4. Papaya Known for the beautiful orange hue of its ripened flesh, papaya can help jump-start a stalled digestive system. “Papaya has a lot of digestive enzymes, a lot of fiber and also some fructose, which for some people can cause a laxative effect,” Chey says. Mango is another fruit with similar traits. 5. Aloe vera juice Cruise the beverage aisle at your local grocery store and you may spot a thick liquid made from the aloe vera plant. A bottle of the stuff, known as aloe vera juice, comes packed with purported health benefits — from clearer skin to heartburn relief. The low-sugar juice can also help with constipation, Chey says, along with another plant, fresh rhubarb. “They actually offer a stimulant effect﻿; they stimulate your colon to contract and can help with constipation in that way,” Chey says. A few other tips: In addition to the foods above, a wide range of fiber-filled fruits, veggies and other snacks can help keep you regular. Berries, though small in size, are mighty when it comes to gut health due to their fiber content. They’re also versatile, Baumohl says. You can put them in yogurt, pile them on top of oatmeal or enjoy them in a smoothie.If you’re reaching for an apple or pear, keep the skin on to up your fiber intake. And add vegetables like artichokes to pasta, Baumohl recommends.Reach for nuts and seeds, which are a good source of fiber and healthy fats.Keep your meals varied and avoid an all-white diet (white bread, potatoes), which can disrupt regularity, Baumohl says. ﻿Fiber is key when it comes to staying regular, but if you aren’t used to a fiber-rich diet, make sure you add it in slowly. It can be a shock to your GI system if you suddenly load up, Baumohl says. Beyond food, pay attention to your posture on the toilet since this can affect your bowel movements. Raising your feet, leaning back or squatting may make going to the bathroom a bit easier, according to the Cleveland Clinic. ﻿ If your constipation doesn’t let up, call your doctor. Medication may be able to help. You should also see a health care provider if constipation is a new problem for you, you see blood in your stool, you are losing weight unintentionally or you have severe pain with your bowel movements, the Cleveland Clinic says. Foods to avoid If you’re constipated, or are prone to it, best to steer clear of matzo, which is dehydrated unleavened bread. In fact, doctors often recommend it for people who have diarrhea, Chey says. The NIDDK also suggests avoiding fast food, highly processed food (hot dogs, frozen pizza, microwave dinners) and meat. Wondering about bananas? Go ahead and grab one, Chey says. They’re known to help with diarrhea, but they can also help with constipation. “Bananas contain a substance called pectin, which has water-holding capacity. So if you have excess water in your stool, it’ll bind up the water and make your stool more fully formed. But the nice thing about pectin is that if your stools are too hard, it’ll also hang on to water and make your stool softer,” Chey explains. A Recipe for Relief Feeling backed up?

A new report from the American Cancer Society finds that incidence rates in women ages 50 to 65 have surpassed those of men in the same age group for the first time, according to the new research published Jan. 16 in the journal CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.﻿ Lifetime risk for cancer is about 40 percent for men and 30 percent for women, the new report states. For many cancers, mortality and incidence trends are at odds Even as cases continue to rise for eight different types of cancer — including prostate cancer in men﻿, and breast, melanoma, uterine and liver in women — the report finds that deaths from cancer dropped by 34 percent from 1991 to 2022, due to progress in cancer treatment, early diagnoses and reduction in tobacco use. Exceptions to the overall decline in cancer mortality include increasing death rates in both men and women for oral and pancreatic cancers, and in women for uterine and liver cancers. Arif Kamal, M.D.﻿, chief patient officer for the American Cancer Society, says that although it’s heartening that cancer death rates have continued to decline over the past 25 years, it’s concerning that incidence is rising, particularly among younger people and women. “Two decades ago, men would be more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than women.﻿ Now what we’re seeing is that gap closing pretty quickly, almost so it’s equal,” Kamal says. “For women between 50 and age 65, we’re seeing growth in cancer, particularly in lung cancer, where more women are being diagnosed than men under the age of 65.” He adds that breast and uterine cases are also rising in women age﻿s 50 to 65. Why are more older women are getting cancer? Although scientists don’t completely understand why cancer incidence is rising in older women, Kamal says unhealthy weight may be a factor, adding that being overweight drives the growth of 13 different cancers. “We particularly need to pay attention to post-menopausal weight gain and post-menopausal obesity,” Kamal says. “The concern is, why is there such an uptick in cancers between 50 and 65, essentially at a time when women go through menopause.” Kamal, an oncologist and former researcher at the Duke Cancer Institute, says women should pay attention to weight gain, particularly later in life. ﻿Because of hormonal changes in perimenopause and menopause, weight gain may actually drive the formation and growth of new cancer﻿s. More than 1 in 3 men and 1 in 4 women are overweight, according to the National Institutes of Health. Alcohol may play a role﻿, as well, along with﻿ eating ﻿ultra-processed foods and red meat (particularly for colon cancer). The U.S. Surgeon general recently issue﻿d a report that said alcohol use is linked to seven different cancers. Larry Norton, M.D., medical director of the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center with Memorial Sloan Kettering, says the increase in alcohol use during the pandemic may be increasing cancer risk for men and women. “The data on high alcohol intake is very clear. There are a lot of cancers associated with high alcohol use,” Norton says. ﻿Researchers are still debating how big of an effect moderate alcohol use has on cancer risk, he adds, but “the one thing everybody i﻿n my field would say is that it’s better to drink less than more.” Cancer continues to rise among young and middle-aged adults What's also concerning is the sharp rise in cancer cases in younger﻿ and middle-aged adults. “There are an increasing number of young people being diagnosed with cancer, particularly under the age of 50,” Kamal says. Last year’s American Cancer Society annual report found that while the overall proportion of cancer diagnoses decreased for adults 65 and older over the last three decades﻿, it increased for those ages 50 to 64.﻿ Additional new research supports the American Cancer Society's data. An August 2024 study published in the Lancet found that younger adults have a higher risk of 17 types of cancer —﻿ including breast, pancreatic and gastric — than older generations would have faced at the same age. Scientists aren’t sure why more young people are getting cancer. However, because younger adults are not typically screened for many types of cancers and some of the cancers on the rise don’t have screening methods, Kamal says it’s crucial for people to advocate for themselves if they have unusual symptoms or notice something changing about their bodies. Norton says there is an urgent need to understand why this is happening. “This is a time for dramatically increasing our research using our modern tools in data science to find things we are not thinking about, that we are not yet aware of﻿, that actually may be associated with these trends.” More Black adults and Native Americans are dying ﻿Alarming inequalities in cancer mortality continue, according to this latest report. Native Americans are 2 to 3 times more likely to die than white people from kidney, liver, stomach and cervical cancers. Black people are twice as likely to die of prostate, stomach and uterine cancer compared with white people﻿, and are 50 percent more likely to die from cervical cancer, which is highly preventable. In Black adults between the ages of 50 and 64, the cancer incidence rate continues to be higher in men than women. Kamal says that although all men should start screening for prostate cancer at age 50, Black men should get a test for prostate cancer earlier, at age 45. Reducing your cancer risk The key things you can do to lower your risk of cancer are the same habits that help keep you healthy in general: exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol and don’t smoke. (See 10 Things You Can Do Right Now to Help Prevent Cancer.) It’s also important to get recommended screenings for cancer, including mammograms for women, prostate cancer screening for men and colonoscopies for both. Norton says exercise is especially important for cancer prevention. “Exercise changes your body's physiology,” he says. “Exercise is not just for your heart, or your lungs or your bones, as many people know, but it’s really for all the cells of your body.” Kamal says that the increase in lung cancer incidence, particularly among non-smokers, should inspire more people to be screened for lung cancer. ﻿Only 6 percent of people eligible for lung cancer are getting screened, he adds. Do you need to get screened for lung cancer? You are considered ""high risk"" for developing lung cancer and should be screened if: You are between the ages of 50 and 80 You have a 20 pack-year history of smoking (this means one pack a day for 20 years, 2 packs a day for 10 years, etc.) AND, you are a current smoker, or have quit within the last 15 years Doctors can now use CT scans to find lung cancer early﻿, when treatment is more likely to be successful. But signs of lung cancer can be easy to miss﻿, and 20 percent of lung cancers happen in people who have never smoked. Kamal says if you have a cough that won't go away, doctors may think it's due to acid reflux or a cold, but once they've eliminated those possibilities, they ""may ignore those symptoms or not pay attention."" ﻿In that case, he says, a patient should bring up the possibility that a lingering cough could be due to lung cancer. If you are diagnosed with cancer, Kamal recommends joining a clinical trial, if possible. He says mortality rates for children with leukemia have dropped 70 percent in the last 20 years, which he believes is largely due to the majority of children with leukemia being enrolled in clinical trials. “When people ask me, ‘When will we cure adult cancer?’ The answer I give is: ‘When we get to the point where most adults with cancer are participating in a clinical trial.’” Do you need to get screened for lung cancer? You are considered ""high risk"" for developing lung cancer and should be screened if: You are between the ages of 50 and 80 You have a 20 pack-year history of smoking (this means one pack a day for 20 years, 2 packs a day for 10 years, etc.) AND, you are a current smoker, or have quit within the last 15 years Elizabeth Agnvall is the health and healthy living editor at AARP.org.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fighting-heart-disease-in-america/,"America’s War Against Heart Disease 75 years after it started, we’re losing the battle against our number 1 killer. Here’s why and what will help Chad Hagen By Sari Harrar, AARP En español Published January 17, 2023 Lori Kubitz’s eyes popped open at 4 a.m. “like an alarm went off in my brain.” She could barely breathe. The pain in her chest felt like a bonfire. Her jaw hurt so much that she thought it would explode. As the sun rose over her lakeside cabin in Pelican Rapids, Minnesota, her husband rushed her to the nearest hospital, some 30 minutes away. “I was scared,” she says. Her father had died of a heart attack. But Kubitz was just 54 years old. She didn’t smoke. Her cholesterol was normal, her weight and blood pressure “just a little” high. “I thought heart attacks happened to heavy smokers, people who were 50 pounds overweight and people in their 70s and 80s,” she says. When she reached the hospital, blood tests and heart scans confirmed her worst fear. Her left anterior descending artery, the heart’s largest, was 99.9 percent blocked. “They were wheeling me into surgery,” she recalls. “I thought, Am I going to die? ” Kubitz’s out-of-the-blue heart attack illustrates a scary new reality. After decades of steady decline, heart disease — long America’s number 1 killer and the third-leading cause of disability — is screaming back with life-changing and often fatal consequences. Return of the killer It was 1948 when President Harry Truman signed the National Heart Act, establishing the National Heart Institute (now the National​Heart, Lung and Blood Institute). Truman also funded the landmark Framingham Heart Study, the world’s longest-running population study of heart disease. For the next six decades, thanks to the explosion in both research and treatment, we were winning the war on heart disease. Deaths from heart attacks, heart failure, heart rhythm disorders and related conditions fell a stunning 69 percent between 1950 and 2009. But lately, the good news has been overshadowed by major reversals. “We’re looking at a crisis in terms of lowering life expectancy for the first time in decades,” says cardiologist Sadiya Khan, M.D., assistant professor of medicine and of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. News reports might point to COVID and the opioid crisis as the drivers of this shift in overall life expectancy, but a 2022 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also lists the rising rate of heart disease deaths as a major reason for that decline. Among the new heart-health trends that are deeply concerning to Khan and other cardiologists: Midlife and younger adults are dying of heart disease﻿s more often. Death rates from heart disease﻿s rose ﻿8.5 percent for adults ages 45 to 64 between 201﻿0 and 2020, says Stephen Sidney, M.D., director of research clinics with Kaiser Permanente Northern California.Record numbers of older adults are dying too. Fatalities due to heart disease among 65-plus Americans rose from 475,097 in 2011 to 556,665 in 2020 (more recent data isn’t yet available). Interestingly, the heart-disease death rate fell over those years; however, the big growth in America’s older population means a rise in total deaths.The COVID pandemic injected rocket fuel into the heart disease resurgence. In 2020 and 2021, heart attack deaths increased by up to 21 percent for those 45 to 64 and 17.9 percent for people 65 and older, according to a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center study. That might simply be a side effect of the pandemic’s long-term legacy of weight gain, inactivity and stress. But the virus itself may be playing a direct role: A large 2022 study found lingering heart risks a year after COVID infection. Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Larisa Tereshchenko, M.D., told the journal Science that contracting COVID could emerge as the number 1 risk factor for future heart disease. James L. Young II in 2011 (left), before he entered the hospital with a heart emergency, and in 2021, a decade after he quit smoking and started to exercise and eat more healthfully. Courtesy James Young II Beyond heart attacks In 2011, graphic designer James L. Young II stood in a Detroit parking lot, gasping for air. He was just 40 years old. But years of smoking, beer and lots of fast food had left him with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. He ended up in a hospital emergency room. “The cardiologist on staff said, ‘If you’d waited one more week to come to this facility, we’d be talking about you in the past tense.’ That’s a wake-up call.” Young wasn’t suffering a heart attack. He had congestive heart failure, a condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently. Doctors recommended implanting a pacemaker. “What’s option B?” Young asked. The cardiologist gave him about a month to improve his heart function by losing weight and exercising. He swapped breakfast bacon for sautéed kale, quit smoking and drinking, gave up fast food and started walking. At first he made it just a quarter of the way around a local high school track. But he soon built up to 10 to 12 miles a day as he listened to house music through his earbuds. VIDEO: How I Discovered I Had Heart Failure Over time, Young lost weight, reduced his medications, ran a couple of half-marathons and returned to college. Now 51, he’s a graduate student in public health at Purdue University and an American Heart Association national ambassador, telling his personal story and serving on an AHA committee that awards funds to heart-disease researchers. “Drinking, smoking and heavy eating were my Band-Aids,” Young says. “I had to learn to value myself as a human being.” As Young discovered, cardiovascular disease isn’t just about heart attacks. It’s a broad category of disorders that covers the blood vessels, muscle, electrical system and valves, as well as the functioning of the heart. (That’s why clots in your leg veins are technically a type of cardiovascular disease.) That said, the primary forms of heart disease include: Coronary artery disease (CAD), when plaque narrows or blocks blood vessels that deliver oxygen and fuel to your heart muscle; this is the classic cause of heart attack.Heart rhythm problems (such as atrial fibrillation, or A-fib), when the heart’s natural electrical system stops functioning​normally, making heartbeats erratic, too fast or too slow.Heart valve malfunctions and heart failure, which is when the heart loses its capacity to pump efficiently, often due to damage from a heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes or CAD. Cardiovascular disease also includes stroke, which is caused by blockages or bleeding in blood vessels in the brain. All told, cardiovascular disease is expected to have killed more than 650,000 Americans in 2022. (That’s roughly 1 in every 5 deaths.). Each year, 2.5 million of us are expected to have a heart attack or undergo a procedure to open or bypass clogged coronary arteries, and 7 million more will live with chest pain triggered by narrowing of those blood vessels, according to the CDC. Overall, 77.5 percent of men and 75.4 percent of women ages 6﻿0 to 7﻿9 have some form of cardiovascular disease, according to a 2021 report from the American Heart Association; among those of us 80 and older, 90 percent have it. Victory and loss Heart disease wasn’t always a major killer. In fact, it was relatively uncommon in the U.S. in 1900, when life expectancy was a cruel 47.3 years and pneumonia, flu and other infections were the top killers. But with the discovery of vaccines and antibiotics, everyday infections and injuries became less lethal. At the same time, another health-related seismic shift occurred: the rise of unhealthy living. During World War II, Americans began to smoke more, sit more at work, eat more saturated fat­ — and we became enamored with sugar and processed foods. The result: Untold millions of Americans upholstered their coronary arteries with gunky, fatty plaque. Between 1940 and 1948, heart disease deaths soared by 20 percent. That emerging crisis prompted President Truman to fund the National Heart Act and the Framingham Heart Study. When researchers began the study, so little was known about heart disease that their budget, ironically, included money for office ashtrays. The early findings of this new research push were bombshells: Smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and being overweight all contributed to heart attack risk — obvious today but groundbreaking information in its day. And so a worried nation slowly began changing its habits. Heart disease death rates began dropping in 1968 — so fast that in 1978, the National Institutes of Health held a conference to determine whether the improvements were for real. James L. Young II in 2011 (left), before he entered the hospital with a heart emergency, and in 2021, a decade after he quit smoking and started to exercise and eat more healthfully. Courtesy James Young II VIDEO: How I Discovered I Had Heart Failure An avalanche of heart disease discoveries was helping to turn the tide. Among them: Open heart bypass surgery began saving lives in 1960. ACE inhibitors, among the most widely prescribed blood pressure drugs today, were approved in 1981. The first cholesterol-lowering statin — a type of drug now taken by more than 35 million Americans — was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1987. In 1970, 38 percent of older adults hospitalized with a heart attack died; in 2010, just 7 percent did. As death rates continued to decline, experts predicted heart disease would become America’s number 2 killer, behind cancer, as early as 2013. But then things changed. Chad Hagen Twin epidemics “I don’t think we’ve ever really won the war on heart disease,” says Andrew Freeman, M.D., director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. “Despite excellent medical therapies, the most powerful of all treatments we have is lifestyle. And we’ve paid lip service to lifestyle for decades.” America’s obesity and diabetes epidemics took off in 1985. Twenty-five years later, heart disease deaths began inching upward. Today, 42 percent of Americans are obese (generally defined as having a body mass index above 30), and another 30 percent are overweight (a BMI between 25 and 30), according to the National Institutes of Health. More than 37 million have diabetes and 96 million more, including 48 percent of older adults, have prediabetes, according to the CDC. “We have more cases of heart disease because important drivers of cardiovascular disease — obesity, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome — are growing more and more prevalent in this society,” says Anekwe Onwuanyi, M.D., professor of medicine and chief of cardiology at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. And in the fight against heart disease, we are moving in the wrong direction. Rates of well-controlled diabetes fell from 57 percent to 50 percent between 2007 and 2018. Deaths due to high blood pressure increased by about 50 percent between 1999 and 2017. In contrast, the prevalence of high cholesterol fell about 42 percent between 1999 and 2018, likely due to the widespread use of statins. “Major reasons for this are limited access to health resources, the ever-expanding number of Americans with obesity, and reduced access to heart-healthy food,” says Nicholas Ruthmann, M.D., a staff cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. The neglected majority Ten days before her 55th birthday, Vonnie Gaither, a high school career counselor and mother of two, boarded a plane in Salt Lake City bound for her home in Anchorage, Alaska. “I buckled my seat belt, talked to the person sitting on my left, and that’s the last thing I remember,” she says. Flight attendants found her slumped in her seat minutes later, unconscious and without a pulse. Flight attendants performed CPR and used a defibrillator to shock her heart so it would beat again. She woke up from an induced coma a day later to find her family gathered around her hospital bed. Her surgeon explained that she had suffered a heart attack; three stents had been inserted into her heart to open a major blockage. Back home a week later, her daughter threw a “55 and Alive” party for Gaither, then accompanied her on walks three times a week on a local middle-school running track. Gaither rediscovered broccoli and spinach, bought fruit salads at Costco and switched to turkey burgers, ground turkey in spaghetti sauce and turkey bacon at breakfast. “I love steak, but I eat it about once a month now,” she says. “It’s a celebration.” She took medications to lower her cholesterol, control her blood pressure and reduce the risk for heart-threatening clots, and she went to cardiac rehab exercise classes. But she still required triple bypass surgery a few months later due to a new buildup of plaque. Today, at 70, Gaither is retired and spends her time painting, bowling and socializing with friends and family. And she wonders about her heart risk. There’s a family history, she says. But there’s more. Gaither is a Black woman, and that elevates her risk in two ways. For decades, women were underrepresented in clinical trials and their heart attack symptoms dismissed in emergency rooms as stomach pain or even emotional problems. The American Heart Association published its first treatment guidelines for women in 1999, but it’s taken longer for science to discover that the anatomy and electrical pathways of the female heart are unique, which may help explain why a woman’s heart attack symptoms can be different from a man’s. Yet women’s heart health is still under-studied, according to a 2022 review of research in the journal Circulation Research, and women’s heart attack warning signs are too often overlooked. In fact, in 2019, just 44 percent of women in a national survey identified heart disease as the top killer of women, and the vast majority were unable to identify many of the symptoms of a heart attack. But health professionals seem to have the same difficulty identifying heart disease in women: The same study found that when women suffering heart attacks arrive at an emergency room, they experience longer wait times and are less likely to be seen by a heart specialist or receive an echocardiogram or potentially lifesaving heart drugs. Another study found that women tend to wait longer before calling 911 when they’re having a heart attack — up to 37 minutes longer. Women are also less likely to receive preventive care such as cholesterol-lowering statins and treatments for heart failure and atrial fibrillation. “Gender biases in medicine still persist,” says cardiologist Emily S. Lau, M.D., of the Corrigan Women’s Heart Health Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “There continues to be a pervasive belief — either conscious or subconscious — among health care providers that heart disease is less common among women and that women are less likely to derive benefit from therapies. And we have not trained our health care providers to recognize the unique ways that women experience heart disease.” Indeed, while men are at greater risk from heart disease when they’re younger, by the time women reach their 70s and 80s, their risk of heart disease actually exceeds that of men. And recent research shows that high blood pressure or diabetes during pregnancy is an early warning sign of lifelong elevated heart risk, even if the conditions resolved after the women gave birth. But doctors seldom explore this aspect of a woman’s health history. In the same way, the war against heart disease has been slow to recognize the heart health needs of African Americans, Hispanics and other racial and ethnic groups. According to a 2018 CDC report, heart disease mortality rates for Black adults are 21 percent higher than for whites, and the Black-versus-white death rate gap actually increased by 16.3 percent between 1968 and 2015. Social determinants of health — like education, neighborhood-level poverty and access to healthy food — explained much of this difference in heart disease rates, a 2022 Feinberg School of Medicine study found. This is important because it refutes the myth that the disparity is unexplained or caused by genetics, says Khan, one of the study authors. Adding to the disparity: Just 3 percent of cardiologists are Black and just 4 percent are Hispanic, according to a 2021 study. Clinical research has shown that seeing a doctor from your own racial or ethnic background “leads to better outcomes — being able to follow recommendations, making lifestyle changes and adhering to treatments,” says Onwuanyi, president of the Association of Black Cardiologists. ﻿ For Latinos, recent studies are puncturing the controversial Hispanic paradox — a belief that Hispanics enjoy protection from heart disease due to strong families, social support, food or perhaps even genetics. A large 2022 University of Miami study found that 6.1 percent of Hispanic women developed heart disease, a higher figure than white women in the study; so did 9.2 percent of Hispanic men, a higher figure than Black and white men. The idea of the Hispanic paradox could be hazardous to the health of Hispanic women and men, Johns Hopkins University researchers warned in a 2022 study, worsening “the existing poor cardiovascular health among the Hispanic population.” “We as a country need to realize that [heart disease] isn’t happening to everybody equally,” Khan says. “There are significant racial and ethnic inequities. If we don’t turn this around, we’re going to see an exacerbation of those disparities.” Chad Hagen The latest heart disease breakthroughs After surgeries for an aortic aneurysm (when the aorta walls balloon out), two hernias and a problematic leg artery, Steven Rowell got a stern warning from his surgeon: Decades of smoking had damaged his blood vessels. “If I wanted to stay around longer, I had to make some decisions,” says Rowell, 63, a hospital-system network engineer from Cape Coral, Florida, who had puffed a pack a day for more than 25 years. “With all the grandkids I have, I wanted to see them grow up.” Rowell began swimming and biking with his wife as she trained for triathlons and began following a more plant-based diet. And he signed up for an innovative test that detects if plaque is clogging the arteries of the heart. The test, known as a coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is widely used in people with early warning symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain. But now some cardiologists are using the test with people like Rowell, who have risk factors like smoking but exhibit no warning signs. The idea is to look inside the heart — while there’s still time to use medications and lifestyle changes to attack dangerous plaque before a heart attack happens, says James Min, M.D., former director of the Dalio Institute of Cardiovascular Imaging at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Min developed an FDA-approved system called Cleerly for evaluating heart plaque in CCTA images and assigning it a risk stage (from no risk to severe risk). “Heart doctors have never actually directly measured heart disease,” Min says. “It sounds weird, but we haven’t. We have used risk factors, like an abnormal stress test or a blockage.” Yet 50 percent of heart attacks happen to people who haven’t had any early warning signs. Cleerly could reduce the risk for those individuals who don’t show any outward signs of being at risk, Min says. The screening technique shows not just the amount of plaque but also the type: Hard, calcified plaque is relatively safe, while soft plaques can rupture and spin off heart-menacing blood clots. Seeing the buildup and knowing its type can help doctors write treatment plans. And seeing actual pictures of what’s going on inside their own heart may motivate people to stick with medications and healthy habits. “Half the people prescribed statins will not be taking them after one year. And by five years, 90 percent are not taking their medications,” Min notes. The day after his scan, Rowell saw his own coronary arteries for the first time. “It was eye-opening,” he says. “I had one artery that was 100 percent blocked. The majority were 30 to 40 percent blocked, and the majority was soft plaque.” Seeing the state of his heart prompted his doctor to change his blood pressure and cholesterol medications and inspired Rowell to upgrade his eating habits and get more exercise. His cholesterol and blood pressure numbers dropped into a healthier range, and he’s lost 35 pounds. In December he will repeat the CCTA test and hopes to see positive changes. Not everyone agrees with the idea of CCTA screenings for people with no heart disease warning symptoms. In 2021, the American Medical Association advised consumers that there was “no high-quality evidence to support routine use” and urged the use of exercise stress tests, which identify blockages in the heart. But the American College of Cardiology has recently partnered with Min in his research, and the Cleerly system is covered by some insurance plans. In October, Medicare began reimbursing $950 for the system too. Chad Hagen The fight for new answers New uses of CCTA screenings are hardly the only advanced weapon being deployed in the war on heart disease. Exciting recent breakthroughs include advances in surgical techniques, implantable devices and more-effective medications. New plumbing tools. In 30 percent of the 965,000 artery-clearing heart procedures performed each year in the U.S., cardiologists face a tough problem: a hard, calcium-packed shell covering soft, gooey plaque in blood vessel walls. This hardened shell can resist cardiologists’ efforts to deploy artery-widening balloons and stents to hold arteries open. But a new technique called intravascular lithotripsy, approved by the FDA in 2021, uses shock waves to break up these hardened deposits. It is similar to technology used to break up kidney stones, is easier for interventional cardiologists to use (the device is threaded through arm or leg arteries to the heart) and may work better for hard areas deep within plaque. “Coronary artery disease patients in their late 60s, 70s, 80s and older will generally have calcium in their blockages, so this is an important tool for treating heart disease in older persons, particularly the very elderly,” says Quinn Capers, M.D., a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. In the clinical trial of 384 people with hard plaque, 92 percent of them were able to receive a stent after lithotripsy, with no heart attacks within 30 days. Meanwhile, doctors are now deploying stents that are stronger, safer and more flexible, providing a variety of new options for patients. On the horizon are biodegradable stents that keep arteries open only long enough for medications and lifestyle interventions to work; when the artery heals, they dissolve. Advanced heart drugs. When sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors burst onto the research scene, scientists thought this new class of drugs would be great at lowering blood sugar. They got a big surprise. “They really reduce episodes of heart failure in the patients with diabetes. Because of this, and because the drugs don’t lower blood sugar if it is not elevated, we tested SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with heart failure without diabetes, and the drug is effective in those patients too,” says cardiologist Nancy K. Sweitzer, M.D., professor and vice chair for clinical research in the Department of Medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and editor in chief of the journal Circulation: Heart Failure. In a 2022 analysis of five major studies, SGLT-2 inhibitors cut the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure by 33 percent. Meanwhile, there are new options for people who can’t tolerate statins or who eventually just stop taking them. Cholesterol-smashing medications called PCSK9 inhibitors are given by injection every three or six months at your doctor’s office or a hospital. They block the breakdown of LDL receptors so more bad cholesterol is shunted to your liver for disposal. They lower LDLs by 50 to 60 percent, and they also reduce the odds of a heart attack by 15 to 20 percent more than statins alone. Effective new implants. Until 12 years ago, older and sicker adults with stiff, diseased heart valves were considered “inoperable” — getting a new valve was deemed too risky because it required open heart surgery. Since then, cardiologists have developed a heart-valve delivery method called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). “Now patients can have their aortic valves repaired in a procedure where a new valve is implanted using a catheter inserted into the femoral artery in the groin,” Caper﻿s says. “Some patients are discharged from the hospital after an overnight stay, with a bandage on their groin.” In 2019, Cleveland Medical Center researchers found that deaths from diseased heart valves in older adults fell suddenly starting in 2013, at the same time that the number of TAVR procedures was increasing in the U.S. The new procedure may be the reason, they note. Today, TAVR is more common than open heart surgery for replacing the aortic valve. “It’s an amazing advance over the past 20 years,” says interventional cardiologist B. Hadley Wilson, M.D., executive vice chair at Atrium Health’s Sanger Heart and Vascular Institute in North Carolina and president-elect of the American College of Cardiology. Your heart in your hands Perhaps the best news about our heart health crisis is that when it comes to your own personal risk, the key to prevention is in your hands, says Michelle McMacken, M.D., executive director of nutrition and lifestyle medicine for NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan. “A suboptimal diet is responsible for almost half of the deaths from heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes,” McMacken says. “Even among those who are living at high genetic risk, a healthy lifestyle can actually reduce the risk of developing heart disease by half.” But according to the American Heart Association, just 11 percent of people in their 40s and 50s and 4 percent 60 and older are taking these essential personal steps. While 72 percent of adults in a recent Harris Poll said they want to talk more about self-care with their doctor, 78 percent of physicians in another survey said they don’t have time during the typical 17-minute appointment. One in 4 doctors didn’t feel confident they could give advice. And in a survey of 1,000 cardiologists that National Jewish Health’s Freeman conducted for the American College of Cardiology, nearly 90 percent had little training or education in day-to-day nutrition. That has to change, Freeman says. “You have to ask patients about lifestyle — and keep revisiting the topic. If we incentivize doctors to spend more time on it, if we show doctors the value of it, these would be extraordinary efforts. If and when we win the battle against heart disease, it will no longer be the number 1 killer.” 5 Amazing Facts About the Human Heart The blood vessels in your heart are the most likely to clog.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/how-to-quit-smoking/,"To Kick a Smoking Habit, Try a Combo Approach If you're serious about quitting, experts say you should start with two Rxs — and build from there Xtock Images/Getty Images By: Hallie Levine, AARP En español Published June 08, 2021 More than half of all adults over the age of 65 who smoke want to quit. Yet only 1 in 20 are able to successfully do so, according to a 2019 study published in Preventive Medicine Reports. One reason their track record may be so dismal is they fail to take advantage of the available treatments. In the 2019 study, only a third of older adults who tried to quit used any sort of proven cessation treatment such as medication or counseling, and only 6 percent followed recommendations to combine both. ""Many older adults have already tried to quit multiple times over the years, so they think there's no real use in trying again,” says Albert Rizzo, M.D., chief medical officer of the American Lung Association. “But we know that your chances rise dramatically if you combine at least one of the FDA-approved medications with some form of counseling.” It can also help to remember that you reap health benefits from quitting, no matter what your age, Rizzo adds. Within minutes of smoking your last cigarette, your heart rate drops, and within a month, smoking-related symptoms like coughing should improve. “Even if you're 90, your quality of life can improve dramatically — you'll notice that your sense of smell and taste improve, you'll experience less shortness of breath, and within a year your risk of heart attack drops dramatically,” Rizzo says. Here, five things to keep in mind as you come up with your own stop-smoking plan: Get a prescription — or better yet, two There are seven over-the-counter and prescription drugs that can help you quit smoking, says Scott Sherman, M.D., a smoking cessation specialist at NYU Langone Medical Center. These include: Varenicline (Chantix), a prescription drug that works in your brain to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cigarette cravings. Bupropion (Zyban or Wellbutrin), an antidepressant that has been shown to help smokers stop, possibly by activating the dopamine centers of the brain. Nicotine replacement therapies. These help to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms. They're available in five forms: the patch, gum, nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges. All work equally well; choosing one boils down to patient preference, explains Sherman. Combining two of these therapies yields maximum effectiveness, advises Humberto Choi, M.D., a smoking cessation specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. “We usually try to start patients on varenicline combined with another nicotine replacement therapy — this appears to be the most effective,” he says. A 2017 study published in the Journal of Smoking Cessation found that a triple therapy — varenicline combined with the patch and lozenge — can also work well, but the trio approach comes with a high risk of side effects such as insomnia, strange dreams and nausea. This may be especially pronounced in older adults, who tend to be more sensitive to medications, so Sherman recommends that you start with just two, and talk to your doctor about adding on if you feel it's needed. Practice mindfulness If hypnosis was the treatment of the 1980s, mindfulness-based therapies are the smoking cessation approach of the early 21st century. “When nicotine gets into your body through cigarettes, it releases a brain chemical called dopamine, which makes you feel good,” explains Jud Brewer, M.D., an associate professor in psychiatry at the School of Medicine at Brown University. “Your brain itself has a built-in reward-based learning system, so each time you smoke, it reinforces a brain pathway that says this is great and do it again."" Mindfulness can help you can hijack that reward system and essentially stub out these cravings, stresses Brewer. One way to do this is to really focus on the sensations of smoking for a few weeks before you officially quit. “When I have patients sit down and really pay attention to it, they notice the burning feeling as they inhale, and the cigarette's unpleasant taste and smells,” he explains. Once you do quit, every time you experience a craving to light up, go back to those specific sensations. A study done by Brewer and published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependency found that people who participated in mindfulness training for smoking cessation were about five times more likely to have succeeded at the end of 17 weeks than those who participated in a more traditional smoking cessation program. Get virtual support Even something as simple as text messages can help you break a habit. Programs like Text2Quit and SmokefreeTXT, which send advice and tips to your cellphone, can more than double success rates, according to a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. “Just something as simple as sending out text messages several times a day can make a big difference, because it keeps you accountable,” explains Sherman. Use of quit apps is another important strategy because you can use them to track cravings, get motivational messages, find tips and distractions to help you manage cravings and bad moods, even monitor progress toward smoke-free milestones. Try to look for an app that encourages you to accept smoking triggers (like iCanQuit), rather than just avoid them. Apps that focus on acceptance are almost 50 percent more effective in helping you quit than those that teach avoidance, according to a study published last year in JAMA Internal Medicine. Another option is a mindfulness-based app, like Brewer's To Quit. A study published in 2019 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology found that people who used the app for a month reported significantly reduced cravings and lower cigarette consumption than those who used a more traditional smoking cessation app. Be careful with e-cigarettes If you're desperate to stop smoking, you may wonder about switching to e-cigarettes, battery-operated devices that heat nicotine into a vapor that you breathe in. Since this vapor has fewer toxins than cigarette smoke, it may be considered a safer option than smoking. A 2021 review looked at 56 studies involving nearly 13,000 adults and concluded that nicotine e-cigarettes were more effective at helping people quit smoking than standard treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy, or nicotine-free e-cigarettes. But e-cigarettes aren't without health risks, as the vapor they generate contains potentially dangerous substances, including lead, volatile organic compounds and cancer-causing agents. “Often the amount of nicotine found in one e-cigarette is higher than what's in a pack of regular cigarettes,” says Choi. “This can increase your blood pressure and heart rate, which is very dangerous for someone who already has preexisting heart or lung disease.” Even if you don't have these conditions, e-cigarettes can still carry side effects such as mouth and throat irritation, headache and cough. “There's also some research to suggest that some people try e-cigarettes as a way to stop smoking, and then end up using both,” adds Rizzo. That's why groups like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Lung Association recommend that you use FDA-approved stop-smoking medications with proven track records of efficacy and safety rather than e-cigarettes. Don't dwell on relapses When you try to stop smoking, it's normal to have a slipup — or several. “It may take 10, or 12, or even 20 times before you become successful,” says Rizzo. The good news is once you make it past those first few months, your odds of starting the habit up again drop dramatically — by as much as 87 percent at six months, according to one study published in the British Medical Journal. Consider each quit attempt a victory, and the longer it lasts, the better. If you do fall off the wagon, it's important to figure out what causes you to slip up, Rizzo says. This way, you can use the information to your advantage on your next go-round. You may want to switch a medication, or try a different app or counseling strategy. “What's important is that you continue to keep trying until you succeed,” Rizzo says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/otc-medications-risky-after-50/,"Your Guide to Aches and Pains View Series Brought to you by 10 Over-the-Counter Medications That Can Become Risky After 50 Age-related changes can affect the way your body handles various drugs and supplements By Maggie Aime, Updated September 06, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published November 17, 2023 / Updated September 06, 2024 Getty Images If you’ve experienced the pain of a headache, the burn from acid reflux or the annoyance of allergies, odds are you’ve reached into the medicine cabinet for an over-the-counter pill or potion to subdue your symptoms. What you may not know, however, is that these seemingly harmless medications come with some risks — especially as you age. One study estimates that harmful reactions caused by over-the-counter medications lead to about 178,000 hospitalizations each year, and adults 65 and older are especially vulnerable to this outcome. One reason: the sheer number of drugs older adults take. Nearly half of adults 65 and older take five or more prescription medications, according to a report from the Lown Institute. Add to this regimen the occasional pain reliever, dietary supplement or allergy pill, and you increase your risk of experiencing drug-drug interactions and unwanted side effects. Another reason has to do with age-related changes in the body. Aging changes how your body processes and gets rid of medications. As we grow older, we lose muscle and gain fat, and this “impacts how the body holds onto medications,” says Ann M. Hester, M.D., a board-certified internal medicine physician based in Highland, Maryland. Organ function also plays a role. Our kidneys, which filter medications and waste from the body, become less efficient as we age, Hester says. And decreased kidney function means medications can build up in the body. Similarly, the liver breaks down many medications, but reduced liver function in older adults slows this breakdown process, Hester says. Beyond kidney and liver changes, having less stomach acid — which also happens with age — can affect how medications are absorbed. What’s more, conditions that become more common with age, such as high blood pressure, can make certain medications, like decongestants, more dangerous. Over-the-counter medications to use cautiously Here’s a look at some over-the-counter medications that can become risky after age 50. 1. Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) Some over-the-counter pain relievers can be problematic for older adults. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) can cause stomach bleeding and ulcers in older adults. Because of this, people who take blood thinners should avoid NSAIDs; the same goes for individuals with unmanaged diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure). Long-term use of NSAIDs can also cause heart and kidney problems, adds Jennifer Gershman, a pharmacist and medical writer based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 2. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Too much acetaminophen — the generic name for Tylenol — can cause liver damage. In fact, Hester says that acetaminophen overuse is the leading cause of liver failure, “and that can kill you,” she says. This means people with liver disease or who drink alcohol should be particularly cautious before taking the pain reliever. And it’s especially important to note that many over-the-counter cold and flu medications contain acetaminophen, so it’s easy to take too much of it without realizing it. 3. Aspirin As with ibuprofen and naproxen, regular aspirin use can increase bleeding risks — and that risk increases with age. ""A lot of people don't think of aspirin as a big serious drug because it’s not a prescription medicine,” says Hedva Barenholtz Levy, a pharmacist and specialist in pharmacotherapy and geriatrics in St. Louis. But Levy says older adults should be careful about using aspirin properly. It’s no longer recommended that adults 60 and older take a low-dose aspirin daily to prevent a heart event, meaning if you’ve never had a heart attack or stroke, you shouldn’t take the pill to prevent one. If you have had a heart attack or stroke or are at high risk for one, talk to your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits before starting aspirin therapy, the latest guidelines state. 4. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) For over-the-counter allergy medications, watch out for diphenhydramine, commonly found in Benadryl. In addition to causing drowsiness, it “can lead to confusion and decreased memory in older adults,” Levy says. Diphenhydramine deserves special attention because it’s an ingredient in common over-the-counter sleep products like Tylenol PM and Advil PM. Instead, choose alternatives “like Claritin, which is less likely to cause some of the side effects,” Gershman says. 5. Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine Decongestants containing phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine, like Sudafed, can spike blood pressure, Hester warns, which is especially risky for older adults more prone to high blood pressure. For example, combining an NSAID and an over-the-counter decongestant could increase the risk of stroke in older adults by raising blood pressure, Hester says. Men with an enlarged prostate should avoid diphenhydramine and decongestants with phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine, as these medications can worsen urinary issues. Given the recent news that oral phenylephrine decongestants are ineffective, consider a decongestant nasal spray like Afrin, Levy says, which is safer than oral phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine medicines. Just be sure to limit use to three days maximum to avoid rebound congestion. 6. Fluticasone (Flonase) and budesonide (Rhinocort) Levy highlights concerns with over-the-counter steroid nasal sprays such as fluticasone propionate (Flonase) and budesonide (Rhinocort). She cautions that they can increase pressure in the eye, which can exacerbate glaucoma, a condition affecting eyesight. What’s more, people who use steroid nasal sprays may experience nosebleeds with incorrect use. 7. Omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium) and lansoprazole (Prevacid) Popular over-the-counter medicines known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) — like omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium) and lansoprazole (Prevacid) — help reduce heartburn, but they require caution. ""Especially with long-term use, older individuals can experience side effects,” Gershman says. These medications reduce stomach acid, which can significantly increase the risk of bone fractures by affecting calcium absorption, she adds. Calcium is essential to maintain healthy bones. Prolonged use of PPIs may also cause severe diarrhea, an infection of the colon by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) bacteria and pneumonia — all linked to acid suppression. Gershman emphasizes that PPIs are designed for short-term use. While prescription PPIs can be used a bit longer, she advises that over-the-counter PPIs are only intended for use up to two weeks. Some older adults end up taking them for years, raising potential risks of side effects. 8. Magnesium citrate, milk of magnesia Gershman recommends older adults be careful with the over-the-counter laxative magnesium citrate. It can cause changes in electrolytes, like potassium and sodium, potentially leading to irregular heartbeat. Magnesium citrate is sometimes used for bowel preparation before colonoscopies. Though it also contains magnesium, milk of magnesia is a “safer option” to magnesium citrate, Gershman says. However, she cautions that even milk of magnesia poses risks with long-term use. This is especially concerning for older adults as magnesium can build up to toxic levels in people whose kidneys are not functioning well. 9. Oxybutynin (Oxytrol for Women) Over-the-counter oxybutynin (Oxytrol for Women) conveniently treats overactive bladders, although the men’s version of the medication requires a prescription. But convenience may come at a cost. Gershman explains that this medication can bring about side effects like dizziness, dry mouth and constipation — particularly concerning for older adults. Oxybutynin belongs to a class of medications called anticholinergics, which are also linked to a higher risk of dementia among older people. 10. Dietary supplements Regarding dietary supplements, Hester says older adults should be extra careful. For example, St. John's wort can increase the sensitivity of your skin and eyes to sunlight; and the sedative herbs valerian and kava, found in calming teas, may affect your liver. What’s more, garlic (in supplement form), ginkgo and ginseng can increase bleeding risk, especially for people who take blood-thinning medications, Gershman says. Also: Beware of taking too many fat-soluble vitamins, Hester warns. Unlike water-soluble vitamins that get flushed out of the body through urine, fat-soluble types — like vitamins A, D, E and K — are stored in the body. Taking excessive amounts of these can become risky. Consult experts and be a savvy consumer The golden rule for over-the-counter medication use is to have your health care provider or pharmacist review the medications you take and flag any potential interactions. Keep an updated list of all your medications — prescription, over-the-counter, supplements — including the doses you take and the reasons for taking them in the first place, and keep this list handy. (Some people keep it on their phones.) Also, know the brand and generic names of your medications. And don't make abrupt changes; some medications must be stopped gradually. A few other tips: Be aware of whether you should take your medication with food, Gershman says. Carefully read labels for directions, maximum daily doses and how long you should take the medication, Levy advises. Labels can be vague, so ask health care professionals for clarity. Opt for over-the-counter medications with a single ingredient instead of combination products, Levy says, especially when it comes to cough and cold medications. And remember: Don't hesitate to ask your pharmacist or physician questions before starting any over-the-counter medication. Editor's note: This story, first published Nov. 17, 2023, has been updated.

Step by step, we'll: Show you the secrets to losing weight Give you guides to healthy foods Provide dozens of delicious new recipes to try Help you embrace a whole new way of eating Get Started Because of the way our bodies change as they age, getting enough protein at every meal is particularly crucial for older adults, says Stuart Phillips, a kinesiologist who studies muscle loss and aging in his lab at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. On average, adults lose about 12 to 15 percent of muscle mass each decade after age 50, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. Eating more protein throughout the day can help prevent age-related loss of muscle and strength, studies show. “Protein is the money in the bank for your muscles,” Phillips says. “In combination with being physically active, it builds a strong pool of muscle that allows you to be more resilient as you get older.” Although increasing muscle mass and strength is protein’s most well-known function, it also helps bone density, supports the digestive process and builds antibodies to fight off infection, says Stephanie Kay, a registered nutritionist and founder of KayNutrition.com. In addition, protein curbs hunger, so you feel full longer, and balances your blood sugar. More protein, earlier Many experts agree that Americans need more than the U.S. government’s recommended daily allowance of .36 grams per pound of body weight, or about 54 grams of protein per day for a 150-pound person, Phillips and Kay say. “The recommended daily requirement is actually the minimum amount for basic health,” Kay says. “As you age you’re going to want to try and consume more than that.” According to Kay and Phillips, .5 to 1.2 gram per pound of body weight (or at least 75 grams a day for a 150-pound person) is a better goal, especially for older adults. But even Americans who get that much protein in a day often don’t get maximum benefits because they tend to get most of their protein grams at lunch and dinner, Phillips says. Because your body has no way to store extra protein, if you consume more than your body can use at one meal, it just goes to waste, he explains. Research indicates you are better off trying to evenly distribute your protein intake throughout the day.

It revealed that those who concentrated their protein grams at lunch and dinner were significantly more likely to be frail than those who ate protein at every meal. Uneven protein distribution was also associated with slower walking speed and fatigue, the study found. Americans especially tend to skimp on protein at breakfast, often choosing cereal, a muffin, a bagel, oatmeal or pancakes for their morning meal, none of which have significant amounts of protein. “Breakfast is the meal I like to target because it’s the first meal of the day,” Phillips says. “If you add protein at breakfast, you feel full, it’s very nutritious, and it sets the tone for the rest of the day.” Good sources at breakfast include eggs, tofu, milk, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt and smoothies made with protein powder. Putting a halt to weight gain The research on protein timing is the impetus behind a new AARP book published by Simon & Schuster, called The Whole Body Reset. Based on research conducted exclusively on adults age 50 and older, it recommends that older people aim to get 25 to 30 grams of protein with every meal. That simple change, coupled with exercise, can stop, and even reverse, age-related weight gain and muscle loss, says Stephen Perrine, AARP executive editor author of The Whole Body Reset. “Our bodies are radically different than the bodies of younger people,” Perrine observes. “Every day is either a muscle-gain day or a muscle-loss day, and what you eat for breakfast is the determining factor in that. By the time the second half of the day comes around, it’s too late. If you skip breakfast or had coffee and a croissant, it’s too late.” Here is a healthy smoothie from The Whole Body Reset to boost your morning protein intake. “Dessert for Breakfast” Smoothie (Gluten-free, vegetarian) It’s so delicious that you may want to serve it in smaller portions as a dessert.

Plus, could ice cream help? By Michael Schroeder, Updated November 19, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published May 12, 2023 / Updated November 19, 2024 Getty Images Nearly 1 in 6 adults, or 15.8 percent, have diabetes, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That amounts to about 40 million Americans who have the chronic disease, when combined with the latest Census data. The rate increases with age, rising to 17.7 percent for those 40 to 59, then to more than 1 in 4, or 27.3 percent, for adults age 60 and older, the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics report found in evaluating prevalence between August 2021 and August 2023. Many more have, about 1 in 3, or 98 million, Americans have prediabetes, where blood sugar has risen above healthy levels but isn’t high enough yet to be classified as diabetes. Naturally, then, it might feel daunting to try to get high blood sugar under control. But fortunately experts say a number of simple (read: straightforward, not necessarily all easy, but doable) steps can bring glucose levels back into a healthy range. You also have plenty of reasons beyond diabetes prevention to do just that. People with prediabetes have a higher risk of suffering from a heart attack or stroke in the future — along with other heart disease issues — “even without full-blown diabetes,” says Zhenqi Liu, M.D., James M. Moss professor of diabetes at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. ﻿ For those with the chronic disease, as the CDC notes in its November report updating prevalence figures: “Uncontrolled blood glucose levels over a long period of time can affect multiple organ systems, including the nervous system, kidneys, eyes, heart, and blood vessels.” All that to say, getting it under control now can be a lifesaver and improve your quality of life as well. Here are steps you can take to reduce your risk and lower your blood sugar. VIDEO: Daily Habits That Could Raise Your Diabetes Risk Here are steps you can take to reduce your risk and lower your blood sugar. 1. Know your numbers To start, you need to know where you stand. The vast majority with prediabetes — more than 80 percent — don’t know they have it, according to the CDC. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends people ages 35 to 70 who are overweight or obese get screened for prediabetes and diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening for all people 45 and up and testing blood sugar earlier in those at higher risk for diabetes. You can assess your individual risk using an online tool provided by the ADA, answering questions about risk factors ranging from age and immediate family history of diabetes to activity level and race. What’s considered a healthy blood sugar number depends on the test. For example, with a fasting blood sugar test, anything below 100 milligrams per deciliter is considered healthy. A glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes and 126 mg﻿/dL or higher is diabetes. Another test, hemoglobin A1C, measures a person’s average blood sugar over two to three months as a percentage. A result of 5.7 to 6.4 percent is considered prediabetes and 6.5 percent or higher is diabetes. For more about testing, see Your Prediabetes Questions Answered. 2. Consider using a glucose monitor Many with diabetes who rely on insulin to help with blood sugar control use continuous glucose monitors — wearable devices that provide ongoing data on blood sugar — to track their levels. While some people who don’t have diabetes use the technology as well to keep tabs on their blood sugar, there is currently no strong data on the effectiveness of this strategy for people with prediabetes﻿﻿. Continuous glucose monitors help with better understanding the immediate impact of lifestyle on glucose levels, explains Megan Kristan, M.D., endocrinologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, “Seeing how different food choices, different activity levels impact your blood sugar,” she notes, “so then you can use that information to make a different choice the next time."" If you’ve been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, talk to your doctor about how to best monitor your blood sugar as you make lifestyle changes. VIDEO: Daily Habits That Could Raise Your Diabetes Risk 3. Don’t complicate exercise Lifestyle changes needn’t be overly involved or difficult to be effective — like with incorporating regular physical activity. “You have to exercise 150 minutes a week,” says Elbert Huang, M.D., general internist and director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago. That needs to be at least a brisk walk, he notes, but it doesn’t have to be more strenuous than that. Experts say the key is to pick a routine you’re likely to stick with, rather than one with onerous requirements you’re not likely to follow. It could be any form of exercise, said Minna Woo, M.D., a clinician scientist and endocrinologist at Toronto General Hospital, and director of the Banting and Best Diabetes Centre. You don’t need a gym membership, she adds To optimize the benefits, consider taking that walk after you eat. Research suggests exercising 30 minutes after a meal may be optimal to help with blood glucose control.﻿ Just don’t stop at cardio, since building muscle can also help with glucose control. Research published last year in Diabetologia suggests combing strength training with cardio is more effective for controlling blood sugar than aerobic exercise alone. “In general, you need muscle to fight off insulin resistance,” says Jennifer Hwang, internist and instructor of medicine at the University of Chicago. Aim to do weight-bearing exercise twice a week, she advises, in line with public health recommendations.﻿ As noted by the CDC, you should try to work all major muscle groups, including legs, hips, back, abdomen or core, chest, shoulders and arms. Getty Images Supplements for diabetes prevention It might be tempting to try supplements, such as vitamin D, omega-3s and berberine, in hopes of lowering blood glucose. But despite a few promising studies, there isn’t yet proof that taking supplements will help prevent diabetes in someone with prediabetes. If you are considering taking a supplement, Amy Hess-Fischl, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator at the University of Chicago Medical Center, advises talking with your doctor first to make sure that it doesn’t interact with other medications, like those taken for high blood pressure or cholesterol. What is the glycemic index? Chances are, if you’re paying closer attention to which foods spike your blood sugar, you’ve heard of the glycemic index. This is used to rate foods containing carbohydrates by how quickly they can cause blood sugar to rise. The scale starts at zero and goes up to 100 for pure sugar. The glycemic index was designed as a research tool. But while it allows for easy categorization, Hess-Fischl notes that the same food doesn’t affect everyone’s glucose level in the same way. How foods are prepared or if they’ve been combined with other foods can also affect blood sugar. So if you’re meal planning, try to avoid separating foods, like sweet potatoes and white potatoes, into “good” and “bad” categories, respectively.﻿ “White potatoes can be healthful if they eat them with the skins,” Hess-Fischl says, adding that their glycemic index is not too dissimilar from that of sweet potatoes (see below). Taking it all with a grain of salt — or, say, a sugar molecule — here’s where some foods fall on the glycemic index: Low (55 or less) Oatmeal Apples, oranges and grapes Carrots and other non-starchy veggies Quinoa Most nuts and beans Skim milk White potato, boiled (54) Medium (56 to 69) Cherries, cantaloupe and raisins Sweet potato, boiled (61) Pumpkin Macaroni and cheese Bagel Couscous Honey High (70 and higher) Watermelon White potato, mashed (8﻿3) Rutabaga Cheerio﻿s, corn flakes and many other cereals White bread Gluten-free bread Rice cakes 4. Get professional help Doctors and dietitians who regularly work with patients who have diabetes can help a person with prediabetes create a road map for getting blood sugar back in a healthy range. Sudipa Sarkar, an endocrinologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, recommends talking with your doctor to see if you’re eligible for the research-backed National Diabetes Prevention Program, a public-private partnership that’s been shown to help prevent the progression to diabetes. ﻿5. Cut back not just on sugar but on all ultra﻿processed foods Obvious blood sugar spikers like cookies and cake should be consumed in moderation. But you’ll also want to be circumspect about other foods that can cause glucose levels to rise quickly. In particular, go easy on all those processed carbs. “When people talk about diabetes and sugar, most people think it’s the sweets they need to avoid, and that’s of course true. But really what’s more common is the starchy carbohydrates,” Woo says. That includes things like bread, pasta, noodles and white rice. “These are the most deadly culprits that will raise their sugar levels,” she says. ﻿6﻿. Get with the guidelines for a balanced diet A balanced diet that cuts carbs could help with weight loss — which itself is protective against diabetes — and quickly bring blood sugar back into a healthy range, according to findings published in JAMA Network Open. Aim for an eating pattern that’s similar to the Mediterranean diet with a well-balanced plate: Getty Images Supplements for diabetes prevention It might be tempting to try supplements, such as vitamin D, omega-3s and berberine, in hopes of lowering blood glucose.

Fill half your plate with veggies Kristan, recommends a plate loaded up with vegetable﻿s. You can’t go wrong with dark leafy greens like spinach as well as pulses, such as chickpeas and beans, which have all been linked to lower blood sugar levels﻿.﻿ Short of going vegan or vegetarian, you may still reduce your risk of developing diabetes by following a healthy, plant-based diet, according to recent research published in Diabetes Care. The study followed 11,965 adults aged 45 to 64 over two decades. It found that those who ate a healthy diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, tea and coffee, while minimizing less healthy plant foods like refined grains and fruit juices along with animal-based proteins, had a lower risk of developing diabetes. However, eating an unhealthy plant-based diet with more refined and sweetened foods wasn’t linked to a lower risk of developing diabetes. ﻿8. Fill a fourth of your plate with healthy carbs This macronutrient, like the others — protein and fat — has a place in a healthy diet. But carbs shouldn’t cover half your plate — which is typical with the Western diet, Kristan emphasizes.﻿ Experts add that it’s important to swap in healthy carbs. Try to have more foods like quinoa or farro, lentils and chickpeas, and brown rice and fewer processed carbs. Instead of villainizing foods, understand where they fit on your plate. Starchy favorites like corn or potatoes will raise your blood sugar and go in the carbs category, rather than that half of your plate that’s devoted to veggies, Kristan says 9. Pump up the fiber The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people with diabetes and those at risk for it eat at least 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories (or 28 grams for a 2,000-calorie diet), following the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for everyone. AARP’s Whole Body Reset, based on the latest research in people age 50 and over, recommends 20 to 25 grams a day for women and 30 grams for men. Vegetables like lentils, nuts and fruits, especially those with edible skin, such as apples and pears, and edible seeds including berries are good sources of fiber, according to the ADA. ﻿1﻿0. Sleep on it Tired of the daily grind? Take it lying down. “Adequate sleep is critical not only for diabetes management but in terms of all metabolic diseases including weight management,” Kristan says. Conversely, not getting at least seven hours of shut-eye nightly is associated with insulin resistance, according to a review of research. When that happens, the cells don’t respond to that hormone like they should — to efficiently take in sugar from the blood and convert it to energy — and blood glucose rises. Plus, being sleep-deprived can make it harder to handle stress, which also contributes to the stew of toxic hormones like cortisol linked to insulin resistance. Think about being overtired and overstressed. “Those two are so interrelated,” Kristan says. She adds that when more insulin is produced, in response, that increases hunger and you eat more calories. Here are some tips to put the spiral to bed. ﻿1﻿1. Lifestyle changes alone not enough? Consider medication For certain patients, medication like metformin may also be helpful to lower blood sugar. “Some people are going to have a really difficult time making lifestyle changes, and some people will tell you I’m more likely to take my medicines every single day to control the prediabetes,” Huang says. While lifestyle changes are part of a comprehensive approach, experts say what’s most important is doing whatever it takes — and not waiting — to lower blood sugar so you can live a longer, healthier life. Getty Images Can eating ice cream prevent diabetes? In a delicious odyssey, an Atlantic article recently dealt with a swirling controversy around an “inconvenient” finding replicated in various nutrition studies: Consuming not only dairy, but ice cream in particular, has been linked with a lower risk of diabetes. As detailed in ""Nutrition Science’s Most Preposterous Result,” not only individual studies but analysis of decades of research has failed to dispense with this clearly consumer-approved but scientifically improbable association. A 2016 paper published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition summarizing data from about a dozen studies found that tucking into at least half a cup of the dairy dessert per week was associated with a 19 percent decrease in diabetes risk (even higher than the 14 percent risk reduction seen with yogurt). But, as noted in the story, the authors of that paper, like other experts, wrote off the findings to what’s called “reverse causation” — in essence that the link between ice cream and diabetes wasn’t going in the direction you’d think. That is to say, for instance, people who are healthy and already at lower risk for developing diabetes might have felt more at ease having rocky road, while those who were already at higher risk for developing the chronic disease might have had less. The key takeaway in all of this, buried about 3,300 words into the sweetly self-indulgent exposé, is sadly vanilla: “To be clear, none of the experts interviewed for this article is inclined to believe that the ice-cream effect is real.” Mark Pereira, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, has long wrestled with the ice cream–diabetes risk reduction correlation in his own research. “I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything like this finding in my career because it’s completely unexpected,” he told AARP. “The Atlantic article was really good journalism,” added Pereira, who was interviewed for that story. But even lacking an explanation for the link, Pereira isn’t about to advise people to make soft serve a feature of their daily diet in the name of diabetes prevention. “There could be something there that’s causal,” Pereira acknowledges, giving at least a glimmer of hope to gelato apologists the world over. “But that’s a far cry from saying, ‘Oh, I would recommend that people with prediabetes increase their ice cream intake.’ I mean there’s so many other ways that you could change your diet and improve your physical activity to reduce your A1C [a measure of blood sugar] and prevent diabetes.” Scooped another way: There’s still no proven reason to expect ice cream will protect you from diabetes. So, for now at least, experts still suggest savoring ice cream in moderation — and not for prevention. Getty Images Can eating ice cream prevent diabetes?

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/swearing-during-workout/,"Can Swearing During Exercise Improve Your Workout? Dropping a choice word or two during your next strength-training session may give you a boost By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published May 05, 2025 A profanity-laced workout may be just what you need for an extra edge. Jade Shulz It’s not often that your potty mouth is granted a pass, but that’s exactly what a growing body of research offers anyone looking to improve their workouts, including the millions of older adults who hit the gym regularly. Experts have known for a while that taboo words (and we aren’t talking dang or darn) have the power to help us release a range of emotions, both positive and negative. Turns out, that very quality comes in handy during certain types of exercise. In a landmark study published in 2018 in the journal Psychology of Sport and Exercise, a team of researchers — working off a hunch that dropping the F-bomb during exercise can improve power and strength — asked participants to choose a swear word they might use in response to accidentally banging their head﻿. They were then asked to repeat that swear word every three seconds during a 30-second, high-intensity cycling test that measures muscle strength and power﻿. Participants were also asked to repeat a swear word for 10 seconds before undergoing a test measuring grip strength and to continue repeating their swear word throughout the test. In both instances, researchers found that swearing improved performance: It increased peak and average power on the cycling test by 4.5 percent, on average, and grip strength by 8 percent, on average, compared to repeating a non-swear word. In a separate study, published in 2022, participants were asked to do chair push-ups, which involve using your hands to raise your body off a chair and holding the position for as long as possible. Those who repeated a swear word while doing so could hold the position for 10 percent longer than those who repeated a neutral word. WTF is going on? The power of profanity Experts aren’t entirely sure why four-letter words have such superpowers during a sweat session. What they do know is that “swearing might trigger a fight-or-flight response, increasing adrenaline and helping people push through physical discomfort,” says Greg Chertok, a certified mental performance consultant at Telos Sport Psychology Coaching. At the same time, the body typically has what’s known as an analgesic response, which increases your pain tolerance. “Swearing helps reduce pain perception, making exercise feel less painful, even when you’re pushing yourself to your limits,” Chertok explains. “There’s also research suggesting that swearing has psychological benefits, such as improving confidence, which could certainly be beneficial in a workout context.” Using expletives to improve physical performance has been shown to work only with moves that are relatively short and intense, Chertok says, meaning strength training exercises like lifting weights and power-building exercises such as kettlebell swings and squat jumps. The same isn’t true of cardio, he adds. ﻿ But that’s not to say there aren’t benefits to a little strategic swearing during your daily power walk, weekly spin class or run around the neighborhood. A study published in 2024 in the Journal of Exercise Physiology suggests that while swearing during intense cardio aerobic activity doesn’t impact endurance, it may make a bad mood a little better.﻿ What’s more, the study found that scores gauging mood and fatigue were worse with neutral words than with curse words. How to practice strategic swearing Swearing in the name of upping your workout isn’t the same as run-of-the-mill, anger-fueled spontaneous swearing directed at, say, the driver who abruptly switches lanes and causes you to swerve, missing another driver by this much. No, strategic swearing involves more control and, ahem, discipline. Where to begin? First off, pick a swear word. The most effective ones are personally meaningful and/or pack an emotional punch, says Nick Washmuth, a researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, who studies the beneficial effects and real-world usefulness of swearing. For most people, suggests a review of research published in 2024 in Frontiers in Psychology, that tends to be the F word or the S word. Whatever it is, you should use it as you would any piece of strength-training equipment: Unabashedly and at a steady clip. In other words, suggests Washmuth, swear out loud using normal speech volume — not whispering, not shouting﻿ — and repeat your chosen swear word just before the physically challenging move and then about once every one to five seconds during the move. As for the swearing averse, unfortunately, a robust dadgummit! fudge! or shoot! won’t get the job done. “Evidence suggests only actual swear words produce the desired psychophysiological effects,” Washmuth says. ﻿ Something else to keep in mind: You should use your self-designated swear word judiciously. Curse words are stripped of their superpower when used to excess, diminishing their emotional charge. ﻿ For those who avoid swearing, that’s good news. “If you rarely swear, you might actually experience a greater psychophysiological response when you do swear, leading to bigger performance benefits,” Washmuth says. “For strategic use, it may be wise to save swearing for special occasions — like tough workouts — to maximize its impact.” Adds Chertok: “The words we choose to use have a very real chemical effect.” For example, even though research suggests only actual swear words have the power to improve physical performance, Chertok believes “singular words like banana and vomit would induce microscopically different psychophysiological responses within us.” ﻿ Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Women’s Health, Prevention, Health and Reader's Digest.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 clear sentences:

The article explores the idea that swearing during exercise can improve physical performance, particularly in strength-training activities. Research has shown that using swear words during high-intensity exercises can increase power, strength, and endurance, possibly by triggering a fight-or-flight response and reducing pain perception. The key to ""strategic swearing"" is to use personally meaningful swear words at a steady clip, just before and during challenging moves, while avoiding excessive use to maintain their emotional charge. This novel approach to enhancing workouts suggests that the words we choose can have a real chemical effect on our bodies.",136
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/long-covid-symptoms/,"Most Common Symptoms of Long COVID Plus, what to do when the effects of a coronavirus infection won’t go away By Rachel Nania, Updated June 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published May 19, 2022 / Updated June 17, 2024 AARP (Source: Getty Images) ﻿Millions of people who have had COVID-19 find themselves suffering from a host of debilitating symptoms that can persist for weeks or even months after their initial coronavirus infection fades. This phenomenon, known as long COVID, has puzzled experts since near the start of the pandemic. And while research is starting to shore up some answers, Greg Vanichkachorn, M.D., formerly with Mayo Clinic, says, “we don’t really have [long COVID] nailed down yet.” A new definition for long COVID On June 11, 2024, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a new, universal definition for long COVID. The group defines long COVID as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” A big reason is because “it looks like more and more symptoms can be associated with this condition,” says Vanichkachorn, an occupational and aerospace medicine specialist who was the medical director of Mayo Clinic’s COVID Activity Rehabilitation Program and is now a physician with Delta Air Lines. In fact, the list of the most commonly reported long COVID symptoms maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes nearly 20, ranging from neurological complications to digestive disorders. Some studies have uncovered more than 50 long-term effects of COVID-19, adding issues such as hair loss and vision loss to the mix. Others estimate that number is much higher — closer to 200. Still, some symptoms seem to be more prevalent. A study published May 25, 2023, in the journal JAMA identified 12 symptoms that most set apart people with and without long COVID. They are: Post-exertional malaise, or the worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion — even minor effort. Fatigue. Brain fog.Dizziness.Gastrointestinal symptoms. Heart palpitations.Issues with sexual desire or capacity.Loss of smell or taste.Thirst.Chronic cough.Chest pain.Abnormal movements. New research from AARP reflects similar findings, with older adults reporting that their most common long COVID symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, cough, and loss of taste or smell. Results from the survey, published Feb. 6, 2024, show that nearly 1 in 5 adults ages 50 and older have experienced long COVID. Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID A new definition for long COVID On June 11, 2024, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a new, universal definition for long COVID. The group defines long COVID as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID Symptoms can be life altering The symptoms, however, are only “half the picture,” Vanichkachorn says. “The other half is how those symptoms really have changed a person’s ability to live their normal lives.” A handful of viruses can cause prolonged illness (experts call this post-acute sequelae), and recovery can be especially difficult for people who required hospitalization or intensive care. But what’s different about long COVID is that it seems to be more widespread, and the symptoms that people experience, even when they no longer test positive for coronavirus, seem to be more robust, Vanichkachorn says. “We’ve had patients complain of fatigue after a viral infection before … but patients after coronavirus infection, they really have some profound fatigue.” For some, this means routine tasks such as getting dressed or taking a shower require assistance. Others have trouble completing everyday errands like grocery shopping or doing the laundry due to their symptoms — “and of course, going to work,” Vanichkachorn adds. Among adults 50 and older living with long COVID, 21 percent say it has had a major impact on their physical health;﻿ 18 percent say it has affected their mental health. Twenty percent of older adults surveyed by AARP say long COVID has impacted their social life. Priya Duggal, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, estimates that 3 to 5 percent of people who have had COVID-19 “feel they cannot function normally in everyday life” due to lasting symptoms. Some people may be at higher risk A few folks may be more at risk for long COVID than others, though Duggal emphasizes that “no one gets a free pass.” People who had underlying health conditions before their coronavirus infection may be more likely to develop long COVID, the CDC says. Research also finds that more women report long COVID symptoms than men, and it tends to be more prevalent in middle-aged adults. According to the CDC, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to get long COVID than people who received the vaccine. And research, while still ongoing, has also shown that people who treat COVID-19 with an antiviral like Paxlovid are less likely to experience lingering symptoms. “When you’re vaccinated or when you treat yourself early on, the burden of virus is much less, and, therefore, I think you are less likely to go on to develop these longer-term symptoms,” says Paul Offit, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and author of the book Tell Me When It’s Over: An Insider’s Guide to Deciphering COVID Myths and Navigating our Post-Pandemic World. “So I think anything that decreases viral replication — whether it’s vaccination or whether it is early treatment — is a value.” Talk to your doctor early if you experience symptoms Lots of questions surrounding long COVID are still unanswered, but one thing is certain: Experts say if you had COVID-19 and notice any new or prolonged symptoms three or four weeks out from your infection, talk to your primary care physician. Don’t wait months before calling for an appointment, Vanichkachorn says. If you don’t have a primary care provider, seek care from an internist, Duggal adds. There isn’t a one-size-fits all treatment for long COVID, Offit says, and that’s because there likely isn’t just one cause. Right now, a lot of it comes down to managing individual symptoms and providing supportive care, and Vanichkachorn says the earlier you start that treatment, the better. AARP research, however, found that less than half of the adults surveyed saw their health care provider to address their ongoing COVID-related symptoms. It’s also important for people with chronic health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes to reach out to their doctor if they notice a change in their numbers after recovering from COVID-19, says Sabyasachi Sen, M.D., professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. It could signal a long-term effect from the infection. The CDC has tips for patients on how to plan for an appointment to discuss long COVID. The agency recommends preparing a list of your current and past medical conditions in advance, and writing down your experience with COVID-19 and any new or lingering conditions. Be sure to include: When they started.How they affect your life.How often they occur.What makes them worse. Finally, bring a list of your current medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to your appointment, and ask questions when you have them. ﻿ Editor’s Note: This story, first published on May 19, 2022, has been updated with new information. Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

The article discusses the phenomenon of long COVID, a condition where people experience debilitating symptoms for weeks or months after their initial COVID-19 infection. Research has identified common symptoms, including fatigue, brain fog, and loss of taste or smell, and a new definition for long COVID has been proposed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Experts recommend that individuals experiencing prolonged symptoms seek medical attention early, as timely treatment can help manage symptoms, and note that vaccination and early treatment with antivirals may reduce the risk of developing long COVID. A surprising insight is that the number of reported long COVID symptoms is vast, with some studies estimating up to 200 possible effects.",137

Around that point, experts say, it pays to be choosier about your foods, and make sure you're getting enough nutritional bang for your buck. “Our need for energy declines starting in middle age,” says Christine Rosenbloom, registered dietitian and nutritionist, professor emerita at Georgia State University and coauthor of Food & Fitness Over 50. “There's less room for drinking a pitcher of margaritas and having a basket of chips — unless we want to start seeing that weight creep. And nobody wants that.” Beyond adapting to a potentially slower metabolism, you also want to compensate for things like a tendency for bones to weaken, bowel function to slow and muscle mass to decline (around 1 percent a year until age 65, after which the loss can double.) In general, older adults “need to make sure they're getting lots of fruits and vegetables, eating lean meats if they are eating meat, chicken or fish, and avoiding saturated fats and sugars,” says Marie Bernard, M.D., chief officer for scientific workforce diversity at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). “A good diet can help get blood pressure under better control, decrease the risk of heart problems and contribute to the prevention of things like diabetes and cancer."" To build your own healthy diet, remember that “foods work together in concert,” says Joseph Gonzales, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic. “You need a whole symphony for a spectacular musical piece.” But if you add these eight foods to your own orchestra, you're well on your way to a healthier tune. 1. Berries Berries provide “one-stop nutrition” for the over-50 crowd because they're high in fiber, vitamin C and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant flavonoids. “Fiber helps keep us regular, manage our weight and protect against diseases like diabetes, heart disease and cancer,” says registered dietitian nutritionist Nancy Farrell Allen, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Men 51 or older should eat 30 grams a day, and women 50 years or older should eat 21 grams a day. Berries also appear to be good for our aging brains. “Berries contain potent antioxidants that may improve motor skills and short-term memory,” Allen says. That's why they are a key part of the MIND diet, which focuses on foods that fight neurodegenerative delay. (Other “brain-healthy foods from this brain-healthy diet include vegetables, beans, whole grains, nuts, seafood and poultry.) A Tufts University study from 2020 looked at 20 years of eating by 2,800 people age 50 or older and found that those who had a low intake of flavonoid-rich foods like berries, apples and tea were two to four times more likely to develop dementia. Berries have other benefits. A 2022 British study out of King’s College London found that consuming 100 grams (about a cup) of fresh cranberries a day helps prevent cardiovascular disease. Another study this year, this one out of the University of California, Davis, found that eating a small number of dried goji berries may help delay or prevent macular degeneration. Alicia Arbaje, M.D., associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, singles out the wild blueberry (usually sold in the frozen food section). “They have three or four times the antioxidants of conventional blueberries. Add them to your oatmeal or smoothies."" 2. Dark-green leafy vegetables ""As we get older, our bones become softer and need calcium,” says Bernard of the NIH. “That's something you can get from low-fat dairy and dark-green leafy vegetables.” We're talking kale, arugula, broccoli and spinach, which are also high in fiber, appear to boost muscle function and are heart-healthy. An Australian study published in March 2021 in the Journal of Nutrition found that people who ate just one cup of nitrate-rich leafy green vegetables every day had 11 percent stronger lower limbs. Another recent study from Denmark looked at 50,000 people over a 23-year period and found that those who ate these veggies had a 12 to 26 percent lower risk of heart disease. And a third study, published this year in the journal Neurology, found that those with the highest levels of the antioxidants found in green leafy vegetables may be less likely to develop dementia. 3. Seafood Fish such as salmon, cod, tuna and trout are a lean source of protein, which older people need to maintain or regain muscle. Bernard recommends shooting for five to six ounces of protein each day, whether it's seafood, poultry, nuts, seeds, soy products or lean meat. “We have studies to suggest that older adults need to be more sensitive to protein intake because their bodies are not as efficient at using protein as middle-aged folks."" Fish is also a good source of vitamin B12, a nutrient found only in animal foods that we have a harder time absorbing as we age. “Seafood also has omega-3 fatty acids,” Rosenbloom says. “Two to three servings a week reduce the risk of death for the bulk of chronic diseases by about 17 percent.” For more ideas on healthy proteins — and for other smart options for people at midlife or beyond — check out AARP’s 2022 book The Whole Body Reset, by Stephen Perrine. 4. Nuts and seeds All nuts are not created equal, but all are good for you, Rosenbloom says. “They have protein and fiber, and they can make you feel full.” Just don't be greedy: “Eat just a handful as an afternoon snack,” she says, “and you won't be starving at dinnertime.” The daily recommendation of one ounce equals 24 almonds, 18 cashews, 35 peanuts and 15 pecan halves. Getty Images Nuts and seeds are also important sources of healthy fats. “Walnuts, flax meal and chia seeds all contain ALA omega-3 fats, which are converted to EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids,” says Allen, who notes that regular intake of omega-3 fats will help protect your brain, in particular. A 2021 study out of the University of Michigan paints a stark picture, saying that consuming a hot dog could cost you 36 minutes of healthy life, while eating a serving of nuts instead could give you an extra 26 minutes. 5. Cottage cheese It could be time to give these little high-calcium curds a permanent place on the weekly menu. “Cottage cheese is a great source of whey protein, which helps stimulate muscle protein synthesis,” says Rosenbloom. “Athletes know this — after a workout, they often have a shake based on whey protein. But instead of doing that, eat cottage cheese."" Getty Images It is also high in calcium and vitamin D. “Our bones are like a bank, and after age 35, we start to lose bone density,” Allen says, “so adding calcium and vitamin D to our diet is essential for maintenance.” (What else helps bone health? Phosphorous, found in nuts, legumes, cereals and grains, and magnesium, in nuts, seeds, legumes and dark green vegetables.) And a study out of Penn State University this year added prunes to that list, saying they appear to help prevent and protect from bone loss in postmenopausal women. 6. Beans and legumes Why super? “Beans help reduce cholesterol,” says Gonzales. “They're loaded with fiber and protein and they're low-calorie.” They're also rich in iron, potassium and magnesium. Look for dry beans or low-sodium canned versions. If you can't find either, says Rosenbloom, “drain and rinse a can of regular beans, and you can reduce the sodium by 41 percent.” (And don't forget garbanzos: Gonzales recommends hummus as a healthy snack.) 7. Water Water — that's not even a food! True, but you need to pay more attention to hydration as you age. “'As we get older, we don't have as good a thirst mechanism,” says Rosenbloom, who recommends keeping an eye on your water intake especially when it's hot and humid and you're sweating — say, while outside gardening. Bernard points out that taking in extra water can help counteract the effects of bowel function declining with age. And remember that often we think we're hungry when we're actually thirsty. 8. Avocados They don’t just taste good — they’re good for you. A 30-year Harvard study of some 110,000 people, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in March 2022, found that those who ate at least two servings of avocado a week had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those who seldom ate them. Diet Boosters Add a dash of one of these for a little more nutritional kick Herbs and spices As we age, changes in our taste buds can have us reaching more for the salt shaker. Resist! Instead, turn to herbs and spices for flavor. “Ounce per ounce, the largest amount of antioxidants are contained in herbs and spices,” says Gonzales, who notes that things like turmeric, ginger, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and parsley really do have nutritional value. Seaweed ""Seaweeds detoxify some of the pesticides, chemicals, heavy metals and pathogens we've been exposed to during our lives,” says Arbaje. One seaweed she recommends, called dulse, is sold on Amazon and in the Asian section of many grocery stores. Sprinkle the flakes on your food, or add the powder form to smoothies. Lemon or lime ""One easy way to get calcium in your diet is to squeeze half a lemon, lime or orange into your water,” says Arbaje. “You'll also get electrolytes, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, all minerals that your body needs."" B12, calcium and vitamin D Experts agree on a “food-first approach,” so you generally want to try to get your nutrients from whole foods before you turn to supplements. “I always say nature knows best,” says Gonzales. But because many of those over 50 fall short on B12 in particular, the National Institutes of Health recommends that anyone over that age take a B12 supplement. The Tufts Food Pyramid for Older Adults also suggests asking your doctor about adding calcium and vitamin D. Rosenbloom advises taking a daily multivitamin that is formulated for someone over 50 and is “USP-verified,” tested by the nonprofit United States Pharmacopeia.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/are-paxlovid-covid-treatments-still-free/,"Are COVID Treatments Still Free? Antiviral medications can help keep a mild coronavirus infection from turning severe By Rachel Nania, Updated March 26, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 01, 2023 / Updated March 26, 2025 Getty Images COVID-19 activity is calmer now than it was during the peak of winter, but public health experts warn not to get too complacent. Unlike influenza and other respiratory viruses, the coronavirus hasn’t settled into a seasonal pattern, and in past years, cases have climbed back up during the warmer months. If you find yourself testing positive for COVID this spring or summer, know that there are prescription treatments that can help keep a mild infection from turning severe. “So it’s important that everyone who’s infected and who is in a high-risk status have access to these medications,” says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. As the pandemic subsided, widespread access to free COVID-19 treatments came to an end. Now, patients need to rely on some combination of private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and assistance programs run by drugmakers to help cover the cost of once-free medications, including Paxlovid. Here’s what you need to do if you test positive for COVID-19 and are eligible for time-sensitive treatments. Who will have to pay for COVID treatments? If you have Medicare or Medicaid Medicare prescription drug plans (known as Part D) are required to cover oral antivirals for COVID-19, and out-of-pocket costs, if any, will vary by plan. If Medicare Part D enrollees have trouble obtaining antiviral coverage, they should contact their plan or 1-800-MEDICARE for assistance, a spokesperson from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services tells AARP. Some Medicare enrollees can get Paxlovid for free through a U.S. government patient assistance program operated by the drug’s maker, Pfizer, through Dec. 31, 2025, according to Pfizer’s website. People with Medicaid can also get free Paxlovid through this program. Here’s how it works: Eligible patients with a prescription for Paxlovid can enroll in the assistance program online at paxlovid.iassist.com or over the phone (877-219-7225). Pfizer estimates that the enrollment process takes about five minutes, and it can be done by the patient, a caregiver, a health care provider or a pharmacist at the point of care. The enrollment form will ask for the basics — name, date of birth, address, phone number, etc. You will also need to enter prescriber information and confirm your insurance status, so if someone else is enrolling for you, be sure they have this information. After enrolling, the patient will receive an electronic voucher that can be exchanged for a free course of Paxlovid at participating pharmacies. There isn’t a similar government program in place for Lagevrio, another oral antiviral for COVID-19 that is available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and is a treatment option for people who are unable to take Paxlovid or, if hospitalized, Veklury (remdesivir). What about Veklury?​ Veklury (remdesivir) is another COVID-19 antiviral treatment, but unlike Paxlovid and Lagevrio, it’s not a prescription pill you take at home. The medication is administered through an IV at a medical facility; therefore, it’s covered by Part B for people with Medicare. If you have commercial insurance, coverage and out-of-pocket costs for Veklury will vary by plan. ﻿​ Merck says it offers a Lagevrio patient assistance program for “eligible patients who, without assistance, could not otherwise afford the product.” It takes 10 to 20 minutes to determine a patient’s eligibility for this program; more information is available at merckhelps.com or by calling 800-727-5400. What about Veklury?​ Veklury (remdesivir) is another COVID-19 antiviral treatment, but unlike Paxlovid and Lagevrio, it’s not a prescription pill you take at home. The medication is administered through an IV at a medical facility; therefore, it’s covered by Part B for people with Medicare. If you have commercial insurance, coverage and out-of-pocket costs for Veklury will vary by plan. ﻿​ If you have private insurance You could face out-of-pocket costs for treating COVID-19 if you have private insurance, since Paxlovid and Lagevrio will “be subject to the regular cost-sharing policies” of your health plan, says Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of the Global Health & HIV Policy Program at KFF. In 2023, Pfizer priced Paxlovid at $1,390 for the five-day treatment course. If your plan doesn’t cover Paxlovid or if your out-of-pocket payment is high, you may be eligible to receive assistance through Pfizer’s copay program, which involves an enrollment process that is similar to the government-backed patient assistance program. To enroll in the copay program, visit paxlovid.com/paxcess or call 877-219-7225. Privately insured patients may be eligible for a coupon from Merck to help them save on out-of-pocket costs for Lagevrio. More information is available at lagevrio.com/patients/coupon/. If you don't have insurance You shouldn’t have to pay out of pocket for COVID-19 treatment in the next few years if you’re uninsured. Paxlovid will remain free for people without health insurance and for people who are underinsured through 2028, according to CMS. You’ll need to enroll in the patient assistance program to get the antiviral at no cost. More information is available at paxlovid.iassist.com or by calling 877-219-7225. Similarly, Merck’s patient assistance program is meant to help eligible individuals who can’t otherwise afford the full cost of the medication. More information is available at merckhelps.com or by calling 800-727-5400. Experts urge patients to be proactive Research highlighted by HHS finds that oral antiviral treatments can reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths by as much as tenfold for people at high risk for severe disease. This population includes adults 50 and older and people with underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease and obesity. However, in order for the medications to be effective, they must be started soon after symptoms appear — ideally within five days. Because time is of the essence, Mariana Socal, M.D., associate scientist in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says high-risk patients should talk to their doctor about whether they’re a good candidate for one of the available treatments before they even come down with COVID-19, so there’s a plan in place if they test positive. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Make sure you have coronavirus tests on hand, Socal adds, so if you experience symptoms, you can quickly know whether you’re dealing with COVID. If you have symptoms but test negative for COVID-19, it’s important to still talk to your doctor, Schaffner says. You may have another illness that requires a different course of treatment. “It is common for people to say, ‘Well, I’ll see if I get better tomorrow.’ And so they put things off, and of course, that allows the infection to continue,” Schaffner says. “We ought to overcome that reluctance and contact our providers early rather than later.” Editor's note: This story, first published Nov. 1, 2023, has been updated to include new information.

Discover what your pearly whites can reveal about your health. 1. Damaged tooth enamel can be a sign of eating disorders Although bulimia and anorexia are most common in girls and young women, recent studies show that about 13 percent of American women over the age of 50 have signs of eating disorders. Serious eating disorders can affect men as well. Bulimia, an illness characterized by a cycle of binge eating and self-induced vomiting, often leads to tooth damage. “Acid created in the stomach by vomiting erodes the inner enamel or thin outer coating of the teeth,” says Leila Jahangiri, clinical professor and chair of the ﻿Department of ﻿Prosthodontics at New York University College of Dentistry. The acid will cause damage to the back of the teeth but will usually spare the bottom front teeth. Jahangiri says the damage can be so extensive that the enamel is completely gone and teeth are thinner and can be seriously chipped. Anorexia, another serious illness, is characterized by weight loss, difficulty maintaining an appropriate body weight and distorted body image. Many people with bulimia are also anorexic, says Jahangiri, so those with anorexia may also have damage to their tooth enamel. 2. Pale gums can be a sign of anemia Anemia is a condition that develops when not enough rich, healthy red blood cells are produced in the body. The low level of red blood cells makes a person with anemia feel weak and tired. It can also cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches and an irregular heartbeat. Postmenopausal women are at higher risk of anemia than men due to iron loss. In the United States, approximately 10 percent of the 35 million people over 65 are considered anemic. Domenica Sweier, clinical professor at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, says that along with many other medical conditions, anemia can cause the gum tissue to be a very pale pinkish-white. “A dentist might look at the gum color, ask additional questions and would likely refer a patient to a medical doctor,” Sweier says. It’s important to note, however, that anemia can’t be diagnosed from gum color, but rather should be diagnosed with blood tests. 3. Osteoporosis can put people at risk for tooth loss Osteoporosis is a bone disease that develops when bone density, mass and structure in the body changes. It can lead to loss of bone strength and risk of bone fractures. Both men and women get the disease, but﻿ it’s more common in women as a result of hormonal changes that cause weakening of the bone, which can cause fractures and other skeletal problems. Fifty-four million Americans have osteoporosis and low bone mass. Half are over the age of 50. Osteoporosis is often called a “silent disease” because many don’t know they have it until bones in the body begin to break. Erinne Kennedy, director for predoctoral dental education at Kansas City University College of Dental Medicine, says that along with age, genetics, hormonal changes and smoking, osteoporosis can be a risk factor for tooth loss. Mary Grace Ash, clinical lecturer at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry and course director of gerontology for dental hygienists, says, “There are lots of bones around a tooth﻿, and indications of osteoporosis include tooth recession, mobility and increase in pockets between teeth,” she says. “And a dentist should be able to spot it.” Tooth loss, however, is not always a sign of osteoporosis. Many other conditions can cause the loss of teeth as people age. 4. Complications of kidney disease can lead to tooth loss The kidneys are bean-shaped, fist-sized organs that filter extra water and waste out of the blood and make urine. When the blood can’t be filtered properly, the result is kidney disease. Symptoms include dryness of the mouth, changes in taste and malnutrition. People who have kidney disease often have compromised immune systems and chronic inflammation. A compromised immune system is susceptible to the overgrowth of bacteria or fungus in the body, which can lead to periodontal disease, Sweier says. Periodontal or gum disease is a common bacteria-induced inflammatory disease that causes bleeding gums, wobbly teeth and tooth loss. Some research shows that those with inflammation of the gums have more compromised kidney function. Additionally, recent studies show that inflamed gums provide an opportunity for bacteria to enter the bloodstream. 5. Oral thrush can be a sign of HIV Oral thrush is a fungal infection caused by a fungus called candida, which is normally present in low numbers in the mouths of many people. The problem arises when there’s an overgrowth of candida. This can be caused by several factors, including a compromised immune system. “When present, oral thrush may cause burning and soreness in the mouth and throat, making it difficult to eat,” says Ash. Because people with HIV/AIDS have compromised immune systems, oral thrush is sometimes a sign of the disease. The National Center for Biotechnology Information estimates that around 80 to 90 percent of people with HIV will have oral thrush. If people with HIV/AIDS practice good oral hygiene and have their mouths checked regularly, symptoms can be discovered and treated early. 6. Acid reflux can cause damage to tooth enamel Acid reflux occurs when the contents of your stomach or stomach acid regurgitates into the esophagus. Symptoms can run from nonexistent to mild to heartburn﻿, or what’s known as acid indigestion, which tends to be more common as people age. About 20 percent of Americans suffer from acid reflux. A dentist should be able to detect tooth damage by erosion from acid reflux right away. Jahangari says the damage from acid will appear on the back of the upper and some of the bottom teeth. “You may feel little holes or notches on your back molars, but generally the tongue protects the bottom front teeth,” she adds. The erosion of tooth enamel caused by acid reflux can cause sensitivity to hot, cold or sweet foods and drink, chipped teeth or sharp tooth edges, discoloration or darkening of the teeth, and thinning and shortening teeth, which can cause changes in your bite or pain and irritation in your mouth. 7. Poor dental hygiene is linked to cognitive decline Poor oral hygiene can be a sign of cognitive decline, especially in those who have previously taken good care of their teeth. As brushing, flossing and dental visits become more difficult, the ability to maintain the health of the teeth lessens, says Ash. Research has also linked tooth loss to a higher risk of dementia. Ash says when an older person who has previously taken good care of his or her teeth has food debris in the mouth, the lack of self-care could indicate decline. Caregiver support may be needed. 8. Teeth grinding can be a sign of sleep apnea Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes breathing to stop or become very shallow during sleep. Pauses in breathing may last from a few seconds to minutes and may happen 30 times or more during an hour. The National Sleep Foundation has found that 1 in 4 people with sleep apnea also grind their teeth at night. Symptoms include snoring, teeth grinding and gasping. Untreated sleep apnea is linked to serious health problems including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, liver problems and possibly even dementia. “It’s amazing what we can learn from studying teeth,” Kennedy says, “and what we learn just may save your life.” Based in New York, Barbara Sadick is a freelance health journalist. Her work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, U.S. News & World Report and The Washington Post, among other publications.","The article explores the connection between oral health and overall well-being, revealing that teeth can indicate underlying health issues. Key findings include links between tooth damage and eating disorders, pale gums and anemia, and teeth grinding and sleep apnea, among others. A surprising insight is that poor dental hygiene can be an early sign of cognitive decline, highlighting the importance of monitoring oral health as a potential indicator of broader health concerns.",141

If you have concerns, don’t put off the exam By Nsisong Asanga Updated April 29, 2025 Reviewed by Jessica K. Caldwell, Ph.D. Comments En español Published January 17, 2024 / Updated April 29, 2025 Teera Konakan / Getty Images Some forgetting is normal at any age. Everybody misplaces their keys, right? But for some people, confusion gets pronounced, and simple tasks such as managing money and driving become difficult without assistance.﻿ Although there is no vaccine or cure for dementia, early diagnosis is still crucial. Seeking help early and getting a diagnosis offer time to try therapies that may slow disease progression and relieve troublesome symptoms. Such actions also give the patient and family members time to anticipate care needs and plan financially. In the United States, more than 7 million people are living with dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. As the older population grows, those numbers are expected to rise sharply. The average age of onset is around 84 years. When it comes to diagnosis, “there’s no specific blood test or brain scan to tell if you have dementia. We often make the diagnosis by bedside testing,” says geriatric psychiatrist Karen Severson, M.D., based in Jupiter, Florida. She’s referring to simple questions a doctor might ask or short cognitive tests to check a person’s ability to recall and communicate, such as drawing a clock face. Although she uses the term “bedside testing,” these evaluations more often happen during a visit to the doctor’s office. Getting a dementia diagnosis Symptoms of Dementia Dementia shows up in many ways.

https://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-2024/medicare-inflation-drug-price-reduction.html,"64 Medicare Prescription Drugs That Are Getting More Affordable The coinsurance rates for certain Part B medications are being lowered temporarily. Here’s why By Rachel Nania, Updated December 23, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 30, 2024 / Updated December 23, 2024 AARP (Source: Getty Images (2)) Some people with Medicare could end up spending less money on potentially lifesaving medications in the beginning of the new year. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that 64 drugs available through Medicare Part B will have a lower coinsurance rate between Jan. 1 and March 31, 2025, since the prices set by their manufacturers have risen faster than the rate of inflation. Drugs that fall under Part B are typically administered in a doctor’s office or hospital and can include cancer treatments, Alzheimer’s treatments and injectable osteoporosis medications. Under a provision in the AARP-backed prescription drug law passed in 2022, the coinsurance rates for these 64 medications will be 20 percent of what the price would have been if it increased with inflation, which will be less than what the beneficiary would pay otherwise. Drugmakers will also face penalties for the price hikes in the form of a rebate to Medicare, and these funds will be used to help ensure the sustainability of the national health insurance program that provides coverage to more than 67 million Americans who are older or have a disability. Some could see significant savings More than 853,000 people with Medicare use the 64 selected drugs annually to treat conditions such as cancer, osteoporosis and substannce use disorder. According to HHS, some people with Medicare taking these medications could see savings in the last quarter of the year that range from $1 a day to more than $10,800 a day. How much each person pays for their medications varies, depending on whether they have additional insurance that covers or reduces Part B’s 20 percent coinsurance. The list price for some of these drugs is hundreds of thousands of dollars per treatment. “By discouraging drug companies from raising their prices faster than inflation, we are keeping prices affordable for the people with Medicare who rely on these drugs to live healthier lives,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. The Medicare Prescription Drug Inflation Rebate Program is just one provision under the 2022 law that’s aimed at lowering drug prices and related out-of-pocket costs. The law also gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for certain prescription medications. The first batch of negotiations included 10 common and costly medications, and when the lower prices take effect in 2026 they will save people with Medicare prescription drug plans a collective $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket expenses, health officials project. Another key provision in the law caps annual out-of-pocket prescription drug expenses at $2,000 starting Jan. 1. The new limit is expected to benefit nearly 3.2 million older Americans with a Medicare prescription drug plan in 2025, AARP research found. That number will swell to more than 4 million in 2029. “The Inflation Reduction Act is lowering prescription drug costs so that people can access the medications they need,” Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said in a news release. “As we head into 2025, people with Medicare will feel substantial relief from high drug prices."" 64 drugs subject to coinsurance rate adjustments ​ Adjustments will take effect Jan. 1 to March 31, 2025 AbecmaAdcetrisAkynzeo CapsuleAtgamAveedBerinertBicillin C-RBicillin L-ABlincytoBreyanziBrixadi (Monthly Dosing)Brixadi (Weekly Dosing)CarvyktiChirhostimCresembaCrysvitaCyclophosphamide (Dr. Reddy)DigifabElfabrioEnvarsus XREvenityFolotynFosaprepitantFragminFyarroGemcitabine (Accord)HizentraImlygicIxempraKepivanceKrystexxaKymriahKyprolisLeukineLupron Depot-PedMeropenem (B.

But there’s a growing list of treatments that can bring relief By Rachel Nania, Updated May 01, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published January 31, 2024 / Updated May 01, 2024 Paula Winkler/Getty Images Hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings. These are the top three symptoms in a long and varied list that women can experience when going through menopause, according to new research from AARP. Other chief complaints include fatigue, weight gain and insomnia — and it’s not uncommon for women to experience more than one of these effects. In fact, a new survey from AARP finds that around 90 percent of women age 35-plus experience menopausal symptoms, some of which can be debilitating and interfere with work and other day-to-day activities. About 40 percent of women endure five to nine symptoms. It’s no wonder, then, that women are trying a variety of treatments to bring some relief. Nearly half of women surveyed in AARP’s research say they have reached for supplements to help manage their symptoms. Others have made changes to their diet and exercise routines; some have tried prescription medications. But doctors say treating menopause symptoms doesn’t need to be a guessing game that you have to play by yourself. The stigma is fading, ﻿research is evolving, and new therapies are giving women more options. “Menopause is definitely having its moment, and people are talking about it﻿,” says Rajita Patil, M.D., director of the Comprehensive Menopause Program at University of California, Los Angeles. 14 Common Menopause Symptoms Nine in 10 women report menopause symptoms, which can be wide-ranging. Here are the most common, according to new research from AARP: Hot flashes Night sweats Mood or emotional swings Fatigue Weight gain Insomnia Changes in sexual desire Vaginal dryness Joint or muscle pain Forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating Headaches Heavy bleeding or irregular periods Urinary issues Painful sex Treatments for menopause There’s not one treatment that’s right for every woman, doctors say. What might work for you depends on your symptoms, your health risks and your personal preferences. “Everybody comes into menopause with a different genetic profile, with a different health profile, with different lifestyle behaviors and different values,” Patil says. “And so all of these things have to be taken into account.” Here are some of the more common evidence-based treatments that doctors say can help many women. Hormone replacement therapy. “The pendulum has shifted” when it comes to treating symptoms of menopause with hormone therapy, which can help manage common menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, says Susan Loeb-Zeitlin, M.D., an obstetrician and gynecologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. The once widespread practice of prescribing hormone therapy came to a near halt in the early 2000s when a study, called the Women's Health Initiative, found an increased risk for heart disease and breast cancer among women taking hormones. But the research has evolved, Loeb-Zeitlin says. “People are starting to understand that for a carefully selected person, there are a lot of benefits.” For example, women in their 40s and 50s who are not at heightened risk for breast cancer or heart disease may benefit — and a long-term follow-up to the Women's Health Initiative supports this. Published May 1 in JAMA, researchers concluded that “menopausal hormone therapy is appropriate to treat bothersome vasomotor symptoms among women in early menopause, without contraindications, who are interested in taking hormone therapy.” “It definitely should be brought up as an option for patients who are candidates for it,” Patil says. “But there are a lot of other options out there.” 14 Common Menopause Symptoms Nine in 10 women report menopause symptoms, which can be wide-ranging. Here are the most common, according to new research from AARP: Hot flashes Night sweats Mood or emotional swings Fatigue Weight gain Insomnia Changes in sexual desire Vaginal dryness Joint or muscle pain Forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating Headaches Heavy bleeding or irregular periods Urinary issues Painful sex New hot flash medications. Last spring, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a first-of-its-kind treatment for hot flashes. The pill, Veozah (fezolinetant), targets the part of the brain that helps regulate a person’s body temperature. (Changes in estrogen levels during menopause affect this area of the brain, causing hot flashes.) Loeb-Zeitlin says so far the medication seems to be “really effective.” And it’s been a great option for many women who are not good candidates for hormone therapy, says Wen Shen, M.D., codirector of the Women’s Wellness & Healthy Aging Program and associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “So, for a lot of my patients, it’s been a game changer.” The issue, doctors say, is that a lot of insurance companies aren’t covering it yet, though Shen points out that the drugmaker does offer a coupon that can help offset out-of-pocket costs. Video: How to Tame a Hot Flash There could be more medications like this in the near future. Pharmaceutical company Bayer recently announced its nonhormone drug candidate that is similar to Veozah eased hot flashes and improved sleep in clinical trial participants. Stay tuned. Other nonhormonal medications. Beyond this new class of hot-flash medications, there are other nonhormonal medications that can help with menopause symptoms. Paroxetine, an antidepressant that belongs to a class of medications known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), is FDA-approved for the treatment of hot flashes. “It can lessen hot flashes, help some of the mood changes that happen with menopause, and even can help women sleep better,” Loeb-Zeitlin says. “And so that’s a great option for women who either can’t or won’t use hormone therapy.” Doctors also sometimes prescribe the antiseizure medication gabapentin and the overactive bladder medication oxybutynin to help ease hot flash symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Another nonhormonal treatment that’s increasingly being embraced by doctors and patients is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common type of talk therapy. Several studies, including gold-standard randomized controlled trials, have demonstrated its effectiveness across a range of common symptoms, and it’s a recommended form of nonhormone treatment from the North American Menopause Society. “This is very powerful,” Patil says. “It’s been shown to significantly reduce hot flashes, improve sleep, mood and quality of life during the menopause transition.” What about lifestyle changes? AARP’s research finds that 29 percent of women surveyed changed their diet to help with menopause symptoms and 28 percent started or changed their exercise routines. Eighteen percent﻿ stopped or changed their smoking or drinking behaviors. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health, these steps can help with sleep troubles, brain fog, mood changes and more. “Diet, exercise, stress management are all critical parts of a treatment plan for women going through menopause transition,” Loeb-Zeitlin says. About 8 percent of women surveyed by AARP report trying psychological or psychiatric therapy to help with their symptoms. “I think it’s underutilized but can be utilized more in the health care system if it’s available to patients,” Patil says. Be mindful of marketing claims The growing list of effective treatment options is no doubt beneficial for women. But with menopause having its “moment,” doctors say patients need to be more cautious than ever. Social media is filled with posts promoting products — gummies, pills, powders and more — that promise to relieve menopausal symptoms. Video: How to Tame a Hot Flash What about lifestyle changes?

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health, these steps can help with sleep troubles, brain fog, mood changes and more. “Diet, exercise, stress management are all critical parts of a treatment plan for women going through menopause transition,” Loeb-Zeitlin says. “Menopause treatment is such big business right now,” Shen says. “And there are a lot of unethical players out there” targeting women who are having “horrific symptoms.” Shen says to keep in mind that supplements are not approved by the FDA — neither are the claims on their bottles. “Women will spend a lot of money to buy them only to find that they don’t work,” she says. What’s more, supplements, even common ones, can cause side effects and can interact with other medications you may be taking, Shen says, so it’s really important to talk to your doctor before trying something new. Forty-five percent of women surveyed by AARP say they have tried supplements to alleviate their menopause symptoms. AARP’s report finds that women, on average, are spending nearly $150 a year on supplements for menopause. Don’t shy away from talking to your doctor For so long, many women have felt as though they can’t bring up menopause symptoms with their doctors, or that they shouldn’t because it’s just part of getting older. “Really until now — and still — I think there’s a lot of discomfort with the idea of talking about it and feeling comfortable with asking for help,” Patil says. However, “women are feeling a little bit more relaxed about coming out of the woodwork and asking their doctors,” she says. Here are some tips for starting the conversation: Ask your doctor if the symptoms you are experiencing are due to menopause or something else, Shen says. For example, hot flashes may be due to a thyroid issue; mood swings could be depression. Don’t let yourself be dismissed, Shen adds. If you find that’s the case, look for another provider, especially one who specializes in treating menopausal women. (The North American Menopause Society has a search function you can use.) Outline all of the symptoms you are experiencing and when they started, Patil says — almost like a diary, so your physician can get a clear picture of what’s happening. Educate yourself on menopause, “but be careful what you choose to read,” Shen says. Misinformation abounds, so be sure to get your information from reliable sources. “[Patients] should feel empowered to really ask questions,” Patil says. The good news, she adds, is that with more people talking about menopause, “I feel like maybe they won’t be as shy or feel embarrassed or feel like they can’t talk to their doctor about it.” Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

The article discusses the common symptoms of menopause and the various treatment options available to alleviate them, as revealed in a new survey by AARP. The survey found that nearly 90% of women aged 35 and above experience menopausal symptoms, with hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings being the most common complaints. Doctors recommend a range of evidence-based treatments, including hormone replacement therapy, new medications like Veozah, and lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise modifications. A key takeaway is the importance of women being cautious of unsubstantiated claims and misinformation, particularly regarding supplements, and instead consulting their doctors to find the best treatment plan for their individual needs.",144
https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/adults-age-60-over-should-not-take-aspirin/,"Your Guide to Aches and Pains View Series Brought to you by Don’t Start Aspirin Regimen to Prevent Heart Attack, Stroke After Turning 60 Health experts warn bleeding risks can outweigh cardiovascular benefits for some, but new research shows many older adults are unaware By Rachel Nania, Updated September 06, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published October 12, 2021 / Updated September 06, 2024 Getty Images If you’re considering taking a daily aspirin to help prevent a heart attack or stroke from ever occurring, know this: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) says that adults 60 and older should not start taking aspirin to lower their risk of a first heart attack or stroke. It also says that people ages 40 to 59 who are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease but don’t have a history of it should talk to a health care provider before starting an aspirin regimen. This guidance, published in 2022 in JAMA, is based on accumulating research suggesting that the potential harms of taking aspirin can outweigh the benefits. Daily aspirin use has been shown to lower the chance of having a first heart attack or stroke, both of which are leading causes of death in the U.S. But the over-the-counter medication, which thins the blood and prevents clots from forming, can also lead to life-threatening bleeding in the stomach, intestines and brain — a risk that increases with age. “The latest evidence is clear: Starting a daily aspirin regimen in people who are 60 or older to prevent a first heart attack or stroke is not recommended,” USPSTF member Chien-Wen Tseng, M.D., said in a statement. People who are 40 to 59 and at higher risk for cardiovascular disease may benefit from starting to take aspirin to prevent future incidents, but they should “decide together with their health care professional if starting aspirin is right for them, because daily aspirin use does come with possible serious harms,” task force member John Wong, M.D., said in a news release. Doctors should take into account a patient’s cardiovascular disease risk and chance of bleeding, among other factors, the task force said. It’s important to note that the USPSTF recommendations do not apply to people who already have heart disease, have had a stroke or are already on an aspirin regimen. “Anyone who already takes aspirin and has questions about it should speak with their health care professional,” Wong said. Many older adults are not following new recommendations Recent research, however, finds that many older adults are not heeding this advice. According to a March 2024 report from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, sponsored by AARP, 14 percent of adults ages 50 to 80 are taking aspirin regularly even though they have no history of cardiovascular issues. Twenty percent of them said they started doing it on their own, and 5 percent began taking aspirin based on the recommendation of family or friends. The poll also found that 31 percent of older adults who take aspirin don’t know about the associated bleeding risk. Similarly, a study published June 25 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine found that nearly one-third of older adults without heart disease reported in a 2021 survey that they took aspirin to help prevent it. One in 20 people were taking aspirin without medical advice. One possible explanation for the disconnect: The latest USPSTF guidance pivots from previous recommendations issued in 2016, which suggested that people ages 50 to 59 with a certain level of risk for cardiovascular disease and a low risk for bleeding take a daily low-dose aspirin to reduce the likelihood of suffering a heart attack or stroke. The old recommendations also said that the decision to start taking aspirin for preventive reasons should be “an individual one” for adults ages 60 to 69 who are at risk for cardiovascular disease. “Aspirin is no longer a one-size-fits-all preventive tool for older adults, which for decades it was touted as,” Jordan Schaefer, M.D., a hematologist at Michigan Medicine who worked with the poll team, said in a statement. “This poll shows we have a long way to go to make sure aspirin use is consistent with current knowledge.” Poll director Jeffrey Kullgren, M.D., said the report’s findings should encourage more conversations between health care providers and patients about what works best for them. “We continue to urge clinicians to be extremely selective when prescribing aspirin for adults without known cardiovascular disease,” Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, M.D., former president of the American Heart Association, said in a 2022 news release. “For example, people with higher risk for gastric or intracerebral bleeding should not take aspirin to prevent a [cardiovascular] event. Aspirin should be limited to only those adults at the highest risk for cardiovascular disease due to the presence and severity of other risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol or significant family history, who also have a very low risk of bleeding.” According to the American Heart Association, nearly half of American adults have some type of cardiovascular disease — a catchall term for conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. Cardiovascular disease accounts for more than 1 in 4 deaths in the U.S. High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for the disease; diabetes, obesity and age can also increase risk. The majority of all cardiovascular events may be prevented by managing risk factors and adopting healthy habits like exercising, not smoking and eating nutritious foods, Lloyd-Jones said. “The scientific evidence continues to confirm healthy lifestyle habits and effectively managing blood pressure and cholesterol are the top ways to prevent a first heart attack or stroke, not low-dose aspirin,” he added.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/who-needs-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-cgm/,"Who Really Needs a Continuous Glucose Monitor? The wearable tech is proven effective for diabetes management but not for prevention, doctors say By Michael Schroeder, Updated June 12, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published June 05, 2023 / Updated June 12, 2023 For most older adults, it’s easy to wear a continuous glucose monitor during daily activities. Courtesy Dexcom If there’s one thing Chih Long Liu knows for sure, it’s that he doesn’t want to suffer the same fate his mother endured. A senior research scientist at Stanford University, Liu relies on data to offset chance — and he’s taking that same studied approach to prevent diabetes. Liu’s mother died after developing end-stage kidney failure, a complication of type 2 diabetes, and her passing had a profound impact on Liu and his sister. “Of course that made us very cognizant of the potential familial risk factors, and we wanted to try to stave off type 2 diabetes in ourselves for as long as possible,” says Liu, who is 44 and lives in Saratoga, California. About six years ago, his sister started wearing a continuous glucose monitor, which allowed her to check her glucose levels throughout the day. Then about a year after that, Liu also began using a CGM after learning he had elevated blood sugar, or prediabetes — a precursor to diabetes — in an effort to bring his blood sugar back into a healthy range. Liu says the CGM helped him to notice patterns, such as how eating particular foods spiked his glucose levels, that helped him get it under better control. “We would certainly credit the CGM sensors [for] contributing significantly toward … modifying diet and exercise to help us achieve that goal,” Liu says. How does continuous glucose monitoring work? CGMs have a tiny sensor that’s inserted under the skin typically through the arm or abdomen. “It’s not quite as uncomfortable as getting a shot,” Liu shares. “It’s almost more like a pinprick.” Thereafter, the wearable devices avoid the need for pricking a finger several times daily, as required with traditional glucose meters. Liu wears his device continuously for 14 days before taking it off and leaving it off for a day, then puts the CGM back on for another two-week stretch. By comparison, people with diabetes — particularly type 1 — usually wear it continuously; others who don’t have diabetes may wear it only for a finite period to make lifestyle adjustments. Instead of blood sugar, CGM sensors measure the glucose in what’s called interstitial fluid, which is found in the space between skin and muscle where there’s fat tissue. Readings are typically taken every few minutes and accessed via a reader or smartphone. In addition to the real-time information, CGMs may also alert users with an audible alarm or beeping if their glucose levels have dropped below or gone above a set range. More data needed to support CGM for diabetes prevention While health experts are excited by the prospect of a data-driven approach to preventing diabetes — which affects more than 37 million Americans — they say CGM’s effectiveness for anything outside diabetes management hasn’t yet been proven. What’s really needed is a randomized trial where a CGM is used by some participants and not by others to show whether fewer who used the device go on to develop diabetes, emphasizes Vivian Fonseca, M.D., chief of endocrinology and the Tullis Tulane Alumni Chair in Diabetes at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. “There is no such study,” he says. The devices, which require a prescription, are FDA-approved for managing all types of diabetes, and the vast majority are still used for just that, according to device makers and distributors. However, as people become increasingly interested in tracking their vitals and other personal health data — like using smartwatches to monitor heart rate and sleep quality — some who don’t have diabetes are accessing the devices via “off-label” prescriptions. And the technology is already available over-the-counter in Europe. Companies like Nutrisense, Levels and January AI provide CGM combined with other wellness offerings that include help interpreting results and applying what’s learned to personalize lifestyle choices. Heather Davis, registered dietitian and health content technical writer at Nutrisense, says in most cases CGM is not covered for people who don’t have diabetes, though it’s worth checking with your insurance. Since first donning his CGM, Liu has participated in precision diet and CGM research conducted by his colleague Michael Snyder, director of the Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford University, and cofounder of January AI. But Liu says he has no financial ties to January or other companies that provide CGMs. Snyder cofounded January AI with business executive Noosheen Hashemi in 2017 after finding CGMs helped closely track blood sugar swings that are linked with an increased risk for diabetes and other issues like cardiovascular disease. Today, even as physicians reiterate more data is still needed to prove its effectiveness outside diabetes management, CGM is being used by everyone from elite athletes hoping a tighter blood sugar range will help with performance to people trying to lose weight. Liu says he’s lost weight and kept off 25 pounds through strict carb control and routine exercise. “The CGM sensor was very instrumental in helping me identify ... both the kinds of foods that produced significant glucose spikes as well as foods that didn’t,” Liu says, with the former including “hidden carbs” like marinated meats. False alarms Liu wears his FreeStyle Libre 2 system by Abbott — one of two major manufacturers that make CGMs in the United States, along with Dexcom — on the underside of his left arm. It has strong adhesive and is compact, allowing him to do everything from lifting weights to showering (it’s water resistant) without taking it off. In the five years he’s used it, Liu says he hasn’t experienced any side effects after first getting used to having it on. But some doctors worry people who use a CGM on their own may struggle with the results. “I think where the big gray zone is dispensing these sophisticated technology” without necessarily having a health care provider to interpret the results, says Archana Sadhu, M.D., an endocrinologist and director of the diabetes program at Houston Methodist Hospital. Technical glitches can also be a concerning factor. Once when Sadhu used a CGM herself to see how her blood sugar fluctuates day-to-day, the device’s alarm went off for nearly 36 hours continuously telling her she had low blood sugar, though she says she had no symptoms. “I confirmed with a blood glucose meter, and it was not low,” Sadhu says. “But the CGM continued to show low.” One problem is the range that may be set on a CGM is conducive to blood sugar control for a person with diabetes — but not for someone without it, says Morgan Jones, M.D., inpatient clinical director in the division of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. “In someone who doesn’t have diabetes, those alarms can actually just be harmful to their mental health,” Jones contends. So, for instance, a person might have a blood sugar that is 65 milligrams per deciliter overnight, which is a totally normal blood sugar for someone without diabetes, he says. “Then they wake up in the middle of the night, they have a lot of stress from that alarm [going] off and they have interrupted sleep. On top of that, they may think they have a new medical condition when they really don’t.” Setting parameters Even the numbers used for those CGM parameters are disputed. In Nutrisense’s app, its default glucose level range is set to between 70 and 140, says Davis﻿. “We have evidence to support that parameter for nondiabetics, she says — like an American Diabetes Association expert group’s suggestion that the low threshold be set at 70. But she acknowledges there is some variation in what researchers might consider hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, and she adds that members are able to customize that range. The Nutrisense app syncs with a CGM to reflect how different foods, stress and more impact the body. Courtesy Nutrisense Slight fluctuations in blood sugar levels are normal, and also happen regularly in people who don’t have diabetes, depending on what food they eat, according to the National Institutes of Health. Between around 60 and 140 milligrams of sugar per deciliter of blood (mg/dl) is considered a healthy level. Davis says instead of automatic alarms, members can get “optional notifications” alerting them to patterns tied to, for example, their glucose numbers after a meal or for the day. Davis says some consumers come to the company with the idea that their blood sugar range should be even tighter, say between 70 and 120, not allowing for normal swings in blood sugar. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 to 125 milligrams per deciliter is considered prediabetes and 126 mg/dL or above is diabetes. (This is measured after a person abstains from eating for at least eight hours.) She says the organization’s trained nutritionists try to educate people about what’s a healthy range, and that advice goes beyond blood sugar. According to the company’s website, that includes providing expert insights, support and accountability to reach a person’s health goals. Are CGMs safe? In April, more than 4 million FreeStyle Libre glucose readers were recalled by Abbott because the lithium-ion batteries used in the readers could get extremely hot, spark or even catch fire, according to the FDA. The readers were linked to at least 206 incidents, including seven fires and one injury, though no deaths have been reported. Generally speaking, however, Jones emphasized that the devices are “extremely safe.” The Nutrisense app syncs with a CGM to reflect how different foods, stress and more impact the body. Courtesy Nutrisense Personalized prevention Davis emphasizes CGMs are but one tool to better understand metabolic health. “One thing that we do emphasize is that we’re not just a CGM company,” she says. “We are a metabolic health company.” There are many factors that conspire to put one at risk for what’s collectively called metabolic syndrome, or insulin resistance syndrome. That can range from a large waistline (abdominal obesity) to high blood pressure to high triglycerides. But where 96 million Americans have prediabetes, and the vast majority don’t know it, according to the CDC, many are overlooking a major risk factor — high blood sugar — and missing out on a chance to prevent diabetes. Without timely intervention, up to 7 in 10 people with prediabetes will go on to develop full-blown diabetes, according to an American Diabetes Association expert panel. “I do think the diabetes endemic is worse than the COVID pandemic, and all you have to do is look at the numbers: 9 percent of people are diabetic, 33 percent of people are prediabetic,” Snyder says. “People don’t really know who’s at risk.” He argues that CGM provides a unique way to personalize behavior modification, where different foods and other factors ranging from sleep loss affect stress in different ways. January AI uses artificial intelligence to draw on its database of millions of foods and make recommendations. “Well, if you like this, and it spikes [your blood sugar], eat that instead — because we know that won’t spike you,” Snyder says. At the same time, device makers are walking the line — not promoting a CGM as diagnostic or curative, which would run afoul of regulations. “Let me put a disclaimer here: This is an off-label use of the device,” says Tomas Walker, vice president of clinical affairs for Dexcom. “The device’s FDA label says they’re to be used for people living with diabetes.” But Walker says that doesn’t mean it will stay that way. “People wear devices to get health information; and it was very natural, I think looking at this in retrospect, that a CGM would be seen as a tool for many people who want to improve their overall health.” Back to basics For all the promise of big data, diabetes experts say what’s still sorely needed is for people to see doctors annually and get blood sugar screened. The American Diabetes Association recommends everyone should have their blood sugar tested starting at age 35, and earlier for those with risk factors like a family history of diabetes. “There are a lot of people who never go to the doctor,” Fonseca says. Access issues like insurance and economic barriers notwithstanding, that’s a bar that’s far less expensive and easier to clear than accessing CGM. Then, once you see your doctor and have your blood sugar checked, “follow the advice,” Fonseca stresses. Even if that’s easier said than done — with or without technological assistance.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/ways-to-lower-cholesterol/,"5 Ways to Lower Your Cholesterol Cholesterol levels creep up as we age and can start causing problems in midlife Udra / Getty Images By Jeanette Beebe AARP En español Published August 04, 2022 Although cholesterol — a waxy, fatlike substance that can cause dangerous plaques to form in your blood, leading to a condition known as atherosclerosis — is more common among people in their 40s and beyond, high cholesterol isn’t an inevitable part of getting older. And having high cholesterol isn’t something you should ignore. Like high blood pressure, high cholesterol — which affects about 38 percent of Americans — leaves a mark on the body: It raises a person’s risk for heart disease and stroke. Cholesterol levels typically plateau around the age of 65, research suggests. But even before that, those levels climb as we age, says Karol Watson, M.D., a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles — and so do the risks for complications that can arise from high cholesterol. In fact, Watson says, “atherosclerosis develops slowly every year, first [starting] in our teens.” If you let it go unchecked over the decades, “you’re going to end up having a problem in your early 50s or even sooner,” she says. Cholesterol isn’t inherently bad, though. The body needs it to build cells and make vitamins and hormones. But in most people, the body, specifically the liver, makes all the cholesterol we need. (Some people — about 1 in 250 — inherit a genetic trait that affects how their body regulates and removes cholesterol, causing them to have high cholesterol from the get-go.) The rest of the cholesterol circulating in the blood comes from food, which is why experts emphasize the importance of making healthy choices to help prevent or manage high cholesterol. Even if your cholesterol is high, there’s still time to get it under control. Here are five ways to do that — and a few may surprise you. First things first: Know your numbers One tricky thing about high cholesterol: It doesn’t come with symptoms. So you’ll miss it if you’re not looking for it. “People should expect that they may have high cholesterol, no matter the age, and should have a blood test to check [their] cholesterol,” says Connie Newman, M.D., an endocrinologist and adjunct professor of medicine at NYU’s Grossman School of Medicine. Your annual exam is a great time to check these levels. If you have diabetes, or if it turns out that your cholesterol is too high, you’ll likely need to get tested more often. Ask your primary care physician to run a full lipid profile. This tests for a few things, including the two different types of cholesterol — low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries; and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good” cholesterol, which helps your liver get rid of cholesterol and can actually lower your risk for heart attack and stroke. The blood test will also check your triglycerides — a type of fat in the blood that your body uses for energy — and your total cholesterol. Optimal levels are as follows, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: about 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for total cholesterol; about 100 mg/dL for LDL (“bad” cholesterol); and greater than or equal to 40 mg/dL in men and 50 mg/dL in women for HDL (“good” cholesterol). Triglyceride levels should be less than 150 mg/dL. One interesting influence: Your cholesterol can rise and fall with the seasons, though “this is not something that’s learned in [medical] school,” Watson says﻿. “Everyone’s cholesterol levels tend to be a little higher in the winter and a little bit lower in the summer,” she says, adding that this difference isn’t due to more decadent eating habits in the wintertime. “Even when they have a controlled diet, they see that there’s just this natural tendency ... [and it’s] not by a lot, you know, maybe 5 percent. But it could be noticeable.” Regardless of the season, knowing your numbers can clue you in on your risks, some of which you can manage with everyday actions. 1. Make unfiltered coffee a treat Espresso, Turkish and French press coffee can spike your cholesterol, because these drinks are prepared without a filter, which allows diterpenes, a chemical compound, to enter your body. Watson says the impact can be “significant,” raising cholesterol “about 10 to 15 percent.” She describes one of her patients as a coffee connoisseur — but when she indulges herself with French press coffee, “her numbers go significantly up.” Once she starts drinking “drip coffee, they go down again,” Watson says. So it’s best to think of unfiltered coffee as a treat, not a mainstay. 2. Eggs are OK — cheese and butter, not so much There’s good news about a different breakfast food: eggs. For decades, people watching their cholesterol were cautioned against eating them, due to their high cholesterol content. But now experts say that eating an egg a day likely won’t do much harm when it comes to your cholesterol levels. Recent studies have found that some high-cholesterol foods, like eggs and shellfish, may not impact your risk for heart disease as much as others, like fried foods (see below). Just remember to watch how those eggs are prepared. In omelets, for example, that cheese and butter are full of something that does raise cholesterol: saturated fat. The same goes for the bacon and sausage that are often served alongside your eggs. 3. Help your body make more ‘good’ cholesterol If you are overweight, smoke, or sit too much and move too little, your body will likely have less “good” (HDL) cholesterol. On the other hand, if you quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight and get enough exercise — research suggests something like “moderate” activity, which is about 30 minutes a day, five days a week — your good (HDL) cholesterol levels will get better. No gym membership required: Walk the dog at a quick pace, ride your bike to work or try something else that you can stick with. Like a lack of exercise, smoking lowers your “good” cholesterol (HDL); it can also raise your triglycerides. 4. Eat fewer fried and fatty foods Unfiltered coffee and cheesy omelets aren’t the only hazard at brunch. Watch out for high-fat baked goods like muffins, waffles, pancakes and chocolate croissants. “Unfortunately, people often [drink] the French press [coffee] with the baked goods,” Watson points out. Row after row of grocery store shelves is devoted to the type of tasty treats that are tempting but not good for your cholesterol: ice cream, cookies and the like. Other seemingly innocuous foods are risky if you eat too much of them — take, for example, full-fat dairy and red meat. There are at least two reasons why: saturated fats and trans fats (which may be called partially hydrogenated oil on packaged foods). Both of these can raise the levels of bad cholesterol in your blood. For people with high triglycerides, “eating the appropriate food (salmon, vegetables, foods low in sugar, for example) can reduce triglycerides by 30 percent or more,” Newman says. If you eat too many carbohydrates or drink too much alcohol on a regular basis, cutting back may also lower your triglycerides, though more research is needed. A very high level of triglycerides “may lead to inflammation of the pancreas,” Newman notes, as well as liver and/or kidney disease, hypothyroidism and diabetes. High triglyceride levels have also been linked with heart disease. 5. Take your cholesterol-lowering medicine exactly as prescribed Statins — medications used to lower bad cholesterol and reduce a patient’s risk of having a heart attack or a stroke — can be effective, “even in people over the age of 75,” Newman says. “If your risk [for heart-related issues] is going up every year that you age and your cholesterol is going up every year that you age, most older people will be recommended to start a statin,” Watson adds. It’s crucial to take these medications exactly as your doctor prescribes them, typically every day. What’s more, never stop a statin medication without consulting with your doctor, Newman says.","The article explores the topic of managing high cholesterol, a condition that affects approximately 38% of Americans and increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. The key findings and recommendations include maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as exercising regularly, quitting smoking, and eating a balanced diet that limits fried and fatty foods, as well as knowing one's cholesterol numbers and taking prescribed cholesterol-lowering medications as directed. A novel insight is that unfiltered coffee, such as French press, can raise cholesterol levels by 10-15%, while eggs, previously thought to be a cholesterol culprit, are now considered acceptable in moderation.",147
https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/best-sleeping-position/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series What’s the Best Sleeping Position for Your Health? How you snooze can affect sleep quality, plus brain, heart and stomach health By Beth Howard, AARP En español Published June 01, 2022 Video: Find Your Best Sleep Position You know how important sleep can be to your health — seven hours a night was recently deemed the ideal in one study. But it turns out that the position you sleep in — on your side, flat on your back or prone — can also make a difference in your health and well-being. Considering that you spend a third of each day in bed, that difference could be significant. Although the experience of individuals varies, experts say some sleeping positions may improve or prevent certain health problems. Here are the preferred ways to sleep for specific concerns. Sleep on your side to breathe better You (or your partner) may have noticed that snoring is worse when you are lying on your back. “It can be significant if you have untreated obstructive sleep apnea,” says neurologist Rachel Marie E. Salas, M.D., assistant medical director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Sleep and Wellness in Baltimore. Obstructive sleep apnea happens when the tissues at the back of the throat relax and close, briefly starving you of oxygen. This leads to multiple awakenings during the night as you sputter or gasp for air. The result: fragmented sleep and fatigue. Snuggling on your side often takes care of the snoring, but Salas recommends getting tested for sleep apnea, which is commonly treated by wearing a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) device. “Eighty percent of people that meet the diagnostic criteria for apnea are not diagnosed,” she says. “But it increases your risk for heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure and heart arrythmias.” Sleep apnea is also linked to an increased risk of dementia. Video: Find Your Best Sleep Position Sleep on your back for back pain If you’re one of the 80 percent of people in the U.S. who has battled back pain, the position you sleep in can mean the difference between waking restored or so stiff you want to crawl back into bed. “Sleeping on your back in the neutral position is the gold standard,” says Shaleen Vira, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery and director of spine surgery research at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. A neutral stance means maintaining the natural curves and alignment of your spine. To do that, place a pillow roll or rolled towel under your knees, and choose the “just right” bed pillow. “Sleeping with too big of a pillow will put your neck in kyphosis, meaning it’s leaning forward and causing strain,” says Vira. “And sleeping without a pillow or too small of a pillow can cause you to be hyperextended,” causing other body stresses. Sleeping on your side — preferably with a pillow between your knees to align your back — is the next-best option, Vira says. But sleeping on your stomach, which requires you to turn your head to one side or the other to breathe, is the worst position for your spine because it flattens the natural curve of your back. It also stresses the back and neck to boot. Sleep on your side to boost brain power Concerned about your brain health? Side sleeping could help keep you sharp and possibly reduce your dementia risk. Here’s why: During the day, toxic byproducts of the brain’s activities accumulate in the central nervous system and are flushed away during sleep via cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The brain waste includes beta amyloid, a substance found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Research from the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) found that this waste clearance system works best when people sleep on their side, particularly the right side, says study coauthor Maiken Nedergaard, a professor of neuroscience and neurology at URMC, who discovered the brain’s cleaning system. The reason it’s beneficial for brain clearance is that the heart helps pump cerebrospinal fluid. “The pumping of blood initiates pulsations of the blood vessel walls that drive cerebrospinal fluid into the brain,” Nedergaard explains. This process works more efficiently when people lie on their sides, boosting the cleaning process. Sleep on your right side to protect your heart Data has shown that when people lie on their left side during sleep, the position of their heart shifts due to the pull of gravity. That causes changes in the heart’s electrical activity that show up on electrocardiograms (ECG). When they’re sleeping on the right side, however, tissues and structures between the lungs hold the heart in place and ECGs remain normal. Sleeping on the left side isn’t a problem if you don’t have underlying heart issues. But for people with congestive heart failure and other heart issues, it can cause discomfort and even breathing difficulties. If that sounds familiar, try turning to your right when you hit the sheets. Sleep on your left side for better digestion The discomfort of heartburn, indigestion and acid reflux disease — officially known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — can ruin a good night’s sleep. But “sleeping on your left side tends to make it a little better,” Salas says. “It takes some pressure off your stomach.” In fact, research shows that not only do GERD sufferers who sleep on the right side experience more instances of heartburn than when on their left side, but these episodes also last longer. Slightly elevating the head of the bed or using a foam wedge to keep your head higher than your chest can also be helpful. “Although it’s not treating the reflux, it can reduce the symptoms,” Salas says. Beth Howard is a North Carolina-based health and lifestyle writer. She has written for U.S. News & World Report, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and Prevention, among dozens of other publications.","The article explores the impact of sleeping position on overall health, addressing the question of what is the best sleeping position for various health concerns. The key findings suggest that sleeping on your side can improve breathing, boost brain power, and aid digestion, while sleeping on your back can alleviate back pain, and sleeping on your right side can protect heart health. A novel insight is that sleeping on your right side may be beneficial for heart health, as it prevents the heart from shifting due to gravity, while sleeping on your left side can help alleviate symptoms of acid reflux disease.",148
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/is-it-too-late-to-get-flu-shot/,"Everyone is Sick: Is it Too Late for a Flu Shot? Plus, the importance of testing and treating during this historically bad flu season By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published February 24, 2025 AARP (Getty Images 3) If it seems like everyone around you is getting sick this winter, you’re not wrong. The U.S. is having one of the worst flu seasons in years, with most states reporting high or very high levels of flu activity. Tens of thousands of patients are filing into hospitals each week, the latest federal data shows, and so far, 16,000 people in the U.S. have died from the flu this season. At the same time, other bugs, such as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), COVID-19 and norovirus, are also swirling about and sickening the masses. Steven Furr, M.D., a family physician in Jackson, Alabama, and board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, says a few factors are feeding the worrying influenza trends this year. “One, this is just a tough flu strain that’s going around right now,” Furr says. “Typically, there are two flu strains we deal with, influenza A and influenza B. Influenza B tends to be a milder strain, whereas influenza A tends to be much more severe. And essentially, every case we’re seeing this year is influenza A.” Another contributor: Flu vaccination rates are low this year compared to previous years. As of Feb. 8, less than half of the U.S. adult population (45 percent) has received a flu shot this season, and roughly the same share of children (45.9 percent) have been vaccinated for influenza, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. “So that really hurts when the number of people who are immunized is much less,” Furr says. Making matters worse, Furr says, is that doctors are seeing more cases of pneumonia following the flu. (Influenza can cause damage to the lining of the lungs, Furr explains, leaving you more susceptible to other infections that can morph into pneumonia.) In some instances, the subsequent pneumonias are resistant to antibiotics, making them especially difficult to treat. Preventing the flu: It’s not too late If you skipped your flu shot this fall, doctors say it’s not too late to get one now. “Usually, you’ll get some protection within a week to 10 days, and we’re not through the flu season yet,” Furr says. While flu activity tends to peak in February, cases can continue through March and April. “In fact, we’ve seen some years where it actually goes to the summer months,” Furr says. Another reason to get the vaccine if you haven’t already: While influenza A is pummeling the country now, sometimes influenza B “starts showing up later in the season,” Furr says. And it’s possible — albeit unlucky — to get infected with both strains during the same flu season. “So really, if you haven’t been vaccinated, you ought to do so,” Furr adds. Adults 50 and older are also eligible for a pneumococcal vaccine, which can help prevent a common type of pneumonia. This vaccine can be administered at any time during the calendar year. Feeling sick? It’s important to test and treat If you start experiencing symptoms of the flu — fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue and more — it’s important to get tested to confirm that what ails you is, indeed, influenza. Symptoms of other respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19 and RSV, can sometimes mimic the flu. Furr says a sure sign of flu is the rapid onset of symptoms. “Most people who get the flu will tell you, ‘I was fine at 11:51 a.m., but I felt really bad at 11:52 a.m.’ I mean, you can just almost point to the time that you suddenly get those severe body aches, then you start getting the fever,” he says. You can get a flu test at your doctor’s office or use a combination COVID-19/flu test, sold over the counter at most drugstores. If you’re positive for flu A or B, your doctor can prescribe antiviral medication that can help keep your symptoms from becoming severe — and the medicine works best when started immediately. (There are also antiviral treatments for COVID-19 if it turns out your infection is caused by the coronavirus.) “Antivirals interfere with the virus and decrease the level of the virus in a person’s body, and thereby decrease complications, decrease symptoms, get you better faster, and in some cases, [they] even prevent death,” Amesh Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, explained in a recent media briefing with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID). Antiviral treatment is especially important for older adults, who are more likely to get seriously ill from an influenza infection, says William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Between 50 and 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur in adults 65 and older, CDC data shows, and 70 to 85 percent of flu-related deaths happen in this age group. “As we get older and physically age, our immune systems also aren’t quite as robust as they were when we were younger, and so our immune systems are less able to fight off these infections,” Schaffner said during the NFID briefing. “As a consequence, older people are more likely to be hospitalized, admitted to the intensive care unit, and, frankly, die of these infections. We would like to do as much as we can to prevent that progression of illness.” Taking an antiviral early on in the course of an influenza infection may also reduce your risk of developing a secondary infection, like pneumonia. That’s because antivirals help keep your immune system in fighting shape so it’s better able to mount a defense against other infections that are trying to take hold, Adalja explains. “When you have influenza, it’s kind of a battle between the virus and your immune system. And a lot of the defense systems go into overdrive fighting influenza, and that puts you at risk for developing bacterial pneumonia because you are paralyzed fighting influenza,” Adalja says. “Year in and year out, the data would indicate that taking an antiviral as early as possible does reduce the severity of illness and keep you out of the hospital and the intensive care unit,” Schaffner says. “And often when it comes to influenza, the secondary bacterial infections that cause the more severe cases of pneumonia, that’s what puts you into the intensive care unit.” A few other tips to help stay healthy this flu season: Avoid people who are sick, cover your coughs and sneezes, and wash your hands and frequently touched surfaces often, the CDC says. Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","The article discusses the severity of the current flu season in the US and the importance of vaccination and timely treatment. Key findings include the high levels of flu activity, low vaccination rates, and the increased risk of complications, particularly among older adults. Notably, experts emphasize that it's not too late to get a flu shot, and antiviral treatment can significantly reduce the severity of illness and prevent secondary infections like pneumonia if started promptly.",149
https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/shingles-vaccine/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by Turning 50? Go Get a Shingles Vaccine It’s extremely effective, preventing a super-unpleasant infection. So why don’t more adults get it? By Barbara Stepko, & Rachel Nania, Updated April 04, 2025 AARP AARP Comments En español Published October 30, 2020 / Updated April 04, 2025 Getty Images ﻿Shingles is sneaky. It’s caused by the same virus as chickenpox — varicella-zoster — which lies dormant for decades in the body, ready to pounce﻿. “Our body gets it under control﻿, but it never fully goes away and lives in our nerves,” says Ian Neel, M.D., assistant professor and director of geriatric medicine at University of California San Diego Health. “But as we age, our immune system wanes, and it puts us at higher risk of this virus breaking out of its cage and reactivating.” In the U.S., 1 in 3 people will get shingles, usually after age 50, with the risk of complications climbing sharply after age 60. Since the risk rises with age, half of those who live to 85 will experience at least one episode. ﻿ Shingles’ most common symptom is an angry, blistering rash. And about 10 to 18 percent of people who develop that rash will also experience a complication known as post-herpetic neuralgia, a condition that affects the nerve fibers and skin, causing burning, and sometimes incapacitating, pain that can last for months (or even years) after the rash disappears. ﻿ ""That pain can be very severe, and it can have very big consequences,” says Juan Chiriboga, M.D., clinical assistant professor of family medicine at Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California. “Shingles rarely kills you,” adds William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. “But it can make you wish you were dead.” Enter Shingrix, a vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. Unlike Zostavax, its predecessor, Shingrix is, in the words of Schaffner, “spectacularly effective.” The numbers support his claim: The two-dose course of Shingrix is 97 percent successful at preventing shingles in people in their 50s and 60s, and 91 percent successful for those in their 70s and older. (That protection stays at over 85 percent in people 70-plus for four years after they get the vaccination.) What’s more, studies suggest the vaccine may also lower the risk of shingles-related strokes in older adults. The shingles shot and your brain The shingles vaccine may do more than protect you from a painful rash and all of the complications that can ensue. A new study published in the journal Nature found that older adults in Wales who received the shingles vaccine were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia over the next seven years than those who did not get the vaccine. Previous studies have reached similar conclusions. “It was a really striking finding,” Pascal Geldsetzer, M.D., assistant professor of medicine at Stanford Medicine and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “This huge protective signal was there, any which way you looked at the data.” The findings support a theory that viruses that affect the nervous system, like the virus that causes shingles, can make people more vulnerable to cognitive decline. Researchers have also seen brain benefits linked to the flu vaccine and other routine immunizations. Why more adults aren’t getting the super-effective vaccine Despite such impressive results, only about 35 percent of adults 60 and older reported receiving the shingles vaccine in 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). What’s behind the hesitation? A couple of things. ﻿ First, says Kristin Christensen, M.D., an internal medicine specialist affiliated with Penn Medicine, in Radnor, Pennsylvania, some of us don’t take shingles as seriously as we should: “People think, If it’s not going to kill me, I don’t need it, without realizing that shingles can be incapacitating, causing severe pain that can really limit people’s functioning.” What’s more, difficulty in getting the vaccine may have discouraged those who sought it out early on. The company that makes the vaccine couldn’t keep up with the initial demand, resulting in long waiting lists at pharmacies. (It’s more widely available now.) Also, there’s the ouch factor — not the needle, but the way the body initially responds to the vaccine itself. “This is a moderately reactogenic vaccine, meaning 20 to 30 percent of people may get a fever, along with pain and swelling at the injection site,” says Gregory Poland, M.D., an infectious disease expert and founder of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. However, Poland notes, the second dose tends to cause less of a reaction, so people do better with it. ﻿﻿ “And the good news is that these symptoms almost always will go away on their own just a few days,” says Pritish K. Tosh, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at Mayo Clinic. Besides, Schaffner reasons, “Having your arm hurt for a day or so is a small price to pay to avoid this infection.” In fact, he notes, “I couldn’t be more insistent and enthusiastic about any vaccine more than the shingles vaccine.” What to know about the shingles vaccine Who needs it? The CDC recommends that everyone 50 and older get Shingrix, even if they had the earlier recommended vaccine Zostavax or if they’ve already had a bout of shingles. Older adults should also get this vaccine, whether or not they remember having had chickenpox as a child. Why? More than 99 percent of Americans over the age of 40 have been exposed to the varicella-zoster virus, even if they don’t recall getting chickenpox. How often? It’s not an annual vaccine, like the flu shot. You only need to complete the series once (it’s two doses spaced two to six months apart﻿). The vaccine is more than 90 percent effective after you’ve had both shots. Why do you need it? One in 3 people will get painful, occasionally debilitating shingles, usually after age 50, and the risk increases as we get older. By age 85, half of adults will have experienced at least one outbreak. ﻿Medicare enrollees with Part D don’t have any out-of-pocket costs for vaccines that the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends for adults, including the shingles vaccine, under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This rule went into effect Jan. 1, 2023, and national data suggests it has helped increase the number of older adults getting vaccinated for shingles. According to a federal report published in May, ﻿nearly 4 million Medicare Part D enrollees received a free shingles vaccine in 2023, up from 2.7 million who received the shot in 2021.﻿ A COVID connection? A large observational study, published in 2022 in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases, makes clear how important it is for older adults to get both the COVID-19 vaccine and the shingles vaccine. Researchers analyzed medical data from nearly 400,000 older adults who contracted COVID-19 and more than 1.5 million who were never diagnosed. (Anyone vaccinated against either shingles or COVID-19 was excluded.) What they discovered: Adults age 50 and older who were infected with COVID-19 were 15 percent more likely to develop shingles within six months of their COVID-19 diagnosis than people who weren’t infected with the coronavirus. The risk shot up to 21 percent if they had been hospitalized with COVID-19. Health care experts surmise that the uptick could be related to the strain of the pandemic. “Anything that is physically stressing to our body is going to potentially keep our immune system so busy that it forgets to protect against shingles for a while, and give it a chance to come out,” Neel says. “And COVID is a very stressful event on our body and our immune system.” Indeed, surveys show a “major increase” in the number of adults who reported stress, anxiety﻿, depression and insomnia during the pandemic, according to the Mayo Clinic. Conversely, another large retrospective study, published in 2022 in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, suggests that the Shingrix vaccine may offer a reduction in COVID-19 risk of diagnosis or hospitalization. Researchers studied data from the electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Southern California members age 50 and older, between March 1 and Dec. 31, 2020. One analysis compared COVID-19 diagnoses and hospitalizations between people who had received at least one dose of the shingles vaccine and those who had not. The other analysis examined shingles vaccination status among people who tested positive for COVID and people whose tests were negative. What they found: Individuals who received at least one dose of the Shingrix vaccine were 16 percent less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19. Shingles vaccine recipients were also 32 percent less likely to be hospitalized during the trial period. Researchers think the vaccine may train the body to react more efficiently to any pathogen it encounters, including the coronavirus. “Our thought was that the shingles vaccine could potentially ramp up the immune system in a way that would also protect against COVID-19,” Bradley Ackerson, M.D., one of the lead authors of the study, said in a news release. However, the researchers stress that people should not use these results as an excuse not to get COVID-19 shots.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test/,"What to Know About the First FDA-Cleared Blood Test for Alzheimer’s Disease Doctors say the test could help individuals who are experiencing symptoms get an earlier diagnosis By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published May 19, 2025 AARP (Getty Images 2) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has green-lit a blood test that can help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. It is the first blood test to be cleared by the FDA for the disease, which affects more than 7 million older Americans and is marked by a decline in memory and thinking skills. The test, called Lumipulse, can detect abnormal clumps of protein in the brain, known as amyloid plaques. These plaques disrupt brain cell function and are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. PET scans and spinal fluid tests can also detect amyloid plaques and have been used for years to help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s. But the tests are expensive and, in the case of the lumbar puncture, invasive. They can also be inaccessible for people in rural areas. Lumipulse, on the other hand, requires only a blood draw in patients 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of the disease. “Having a blood test just makes it so much easier in being able to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,” said Charles Bernick, M.D., a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, based in Las Vegas. In its news release, the test’s manufacturer, Fujirebio Diagnostics, didn’t specify the cost of the test. People without symptoms shouldn’t test The newly approved blood test measures two proteins in the liquid part of the blood, known as plasma, and then calculates the ratio of these proteins, which is “correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan,” the FDA said. The test is only meant for older adults who are experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease; it is not a screening test. What’s more, the FDA said, the results should be used along with “other clinical evaluations or additional tests” to determine treatment options. In addition to brain imaging and lumbar punctures, doctors often use neurological exams and cognitive tests, for example, to diagnose a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. “It still becomes a diagnosis where you have to really look at the whole picture,” Bernick said. In recent years, the FDA has approved two medications for the treatment of Alzheimer’s — Kisunla (donanemab) and Leqembi (lecanemab). These drugs, which are given by infusion, don’t cure the disease but can help to slow the rate of decline in people in its early stages. Because they work by clearing amyloid plaques from the brain, the presence of amyloid must be confirmed before they can be prescribed. “They carry some risk. So if you’re going to use them or utilize them, you’ve got to be pretty sure the person has that protein in the brain,” Bernick said. Risks can include swelling and bleeding in the brain. New test could ‘revolutionize’ research and clinical care Some Alzheimer’s specialists have already been using blood tests not cleared by the FDA to help with a diagnosis of the disease. The FDA’s approval is not required for laboratory-developed tests such as these blood tests. Having the agency’s sign-off, however, confirms a test’s accuracy and opens the door for insurance coverage and more widespread use. Expert groups applauded the FDA’s May 16 announcement. Howard Fillit, M.D., co-founder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said that there’s been a “tremendous need” for blood tests and that having one will “revolutionize clinical care and clinical research” for Alzheimer’s. “It’s going to reduce the cost of care and diagnosis, and it’s going to give people the opportunity to get a definitive diagnosis and enter into clinical trials,” Fillit told AARP. “Today marks another important step in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis,” Maria C. Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead at the Alzheimer’s Association, said in a statement. “For too long, Americans have struggled to get a simple and accurate diagnosis; with today’s action by the FDA we are hopeful it will be easier for more individuals to receive an accurate diagnosis earlier.” Fillit predicts that we’ll see more blood tests in the near future, including tests that detect other key features of Alzheimer’s disease, such as inflammation in the brain. Having such tests could help doctors tailor a patient’s treatment as more medications come online. “It’s kind of going to look like cancer, where patients have a tumor, there’s a biopsy of the tumor, the tumor cells are taken to the lab, they’re characterized according to various biomarkers, and then a treatment plan with various drugs in combination is designed for the patient, and the patient receives multiple drugs affecting multiple pathways in the cancer cell,"" Fillit said. ""We’re going to have that for Alzheimer’s disease in the future. So this is just the beginning of really going into a new age of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and care and clinical trials.” Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

In women ages 50 and older, rates of new cases continue to increase by almost 3 percent each year. The good news: Melanoma is highly curable if it’s caught early. Do you know what to look for? The hallmarks of melanoma are asymmetrical or rough-looking moles without clearly defined borders. A spot on the skin that continues to grow in size or change is another indication, and a once-monthly body scan is an easy way to keep tabs on any of these concerning characteristics. But there are also some more unusual signs that could signal the presence of the skin cancer. “Melanoma is such a rule breaker,” says Elizabeth Buchbinder, M.D., an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Little moles can cause big trouble, and new spots can grow and spread quickly, she adds. “And so knowing what to look out for is super important.” Here are four warning signs of melanoma you need to know about so that no spot goes unnoticed. 1. The ‘ugly duckling’ People who have lots of moles are at increased risk for melanoma. That doesn’t mean, however, that you need to panic over every mark on your body. Pay attention to the moles that stand out — those that are darker than the rest, have changed recently or are more oddly shaped. Buchbinder calls these “ugly ducklings.” “If you have a bunch of dark moles, but you have 50 of them, they’re not all melanomas,” she says. “But if you have one mole that really looks different than the others, and it’s kind of that ugly duckling, that’s the one that you really want to get looked at and checked.” With women, melanomas most commonly appear on the arms and legs. Men need to pay special attention to their head, neck, back and trunk. Still, those aren’t the only places this type of skin cancer can pop up. 2. ‘Where the sun doesn’t shine’ The majority of melanomas are thought to be caused by ultraviolet (UV) light, but not all of them come from sun exposure. Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body, including “in places the sun doesn’t shine,” like the soles of the feet or the palms of the hand, says Elizabeth Quigley, M.D., a dermatologist and associate physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The cancer can also appear as a dark streak under a fingernail or toenail, which is what happened to musician Bob Marley. He initially mistook his melanoma for a bruise on the toe and eventually died from it. (A clue that you should see a doctor: If you discover a dark spot under the nail bed that doesn’t grow out with the nail over time, like a blood blister would, Buchbinder says it’s time to make an appointment.) And while it’s rarer, melanoma also can develop on the eye, inside the mouth or on the scalp. Buchbinder has even seen patients experience changes in their hair color — “someone who had gray hair and developed a black streak” — because of a melanoma growing on the scalp. “So, strange things can happen, but these aren’t common ones,” she adds. That said, these “hidden” melanomas are more common in people with darker skin, points out Vishal Patel, M.D., associate professor of dermatology at the George Washington School of Medicine & Health Sciences and director of the cutaneous oncology program at the GW Cancer Center. “I tell Black and Indian and Asian patients that if you have nail changes, [any dark spots] on your palms and soles, as well as in the eye and mouth, these are ones that I worry about,” Patel says. “Because while it is less common to have that, when it does happen, it is worse. So, it’s important to know about that.” Melanoma is 20 times more common in white individuals than in Black individuals, according to the American Cancer Society. Hispanics are also less likely than their white peers to get the skin cancer. However, ﻿when melanoma develops in people of color, it’s often diagnosed at a later, more dangerous stage. A 2019 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the five-year melanoma survival rate among non-Hispanic ﻿Black populations was 66.2 percent, compared with 90.1 percent for non-Hispanic white populations. 3. Red, white and blue hues Melanomas are often depicted as dark-brown moles, but they can actually present in a variety of colors. The cancer may have a blue tint to it, from deeper pigmentation, says Robert Brodell, M.D., chair of the Department of Dermatology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Or it can appear red, the result of an immune response. “The body is attacking it. It knows it’s abnormal and it’s trying to defend itself, and you get inflammation,” Brodell explains. It’s also possible for a melanoma to “look like a rash,” Quigley says, and to take on a pink hue. But when the spot doesn’t get better with creams and other treatments that normally nix a rash, “you need to check and make sure that that’s not a skin cancer,” she adds. Another sign of a melanoma can be lack of color. Some of these cancerous spots lose their pigmentation completely or partially, leaving a halo of white around a darker spot. “And that’s something that gives us a little concern,” Buchbinder says. “Was the body recognizing something like a melanoma that was going wrong, and in its process of destroying the melanoma, it destroyed some of the normal melanocytes [cells in the skin that produce pigment] in that area? It’s just one of those things that may kind of make you look a little closer at something.” 4. Spots on the skin that bleed or itch If a mole on your body starts to itch or becomes more painful or tender, you need to get it checked out. The same goes if the surface of a mole changes — maybe it starts to ooze or bleed or take on a scalier appearance and doesn’t heal on its own. “We think that some of that irritation — the itching, the bleeding — is actually the body starting to recognize [the cancer] and starting to attack it a little, making it irritated. That’s why you’ll see some itching and bleeding and irritation near the actual mole,” Buchbinder says. Video: You’re applying sunscreen wrong; here’s what to do Skin cancer prevention Wearing sun-protective clothing, sporting UV-blocking sunglasses and lathering on sunscreen are some of the most effective ways to prevent melanoma. Risk Factors for Skin Cancer Do you know your skin cancer risk? According to the CDC, the most common risk factors include: A lighter natural skin color Skin that burns, freckles, reddens easily or becomes painful in the sun Blue or green eyes Blond or red hair A large number of moles A family history of skin cancer A personal history of skin cancer Older age Another thing to keep in mind: People on certain blood pressure medications — including diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine — need to be extra cautious when spending time outside. “Many of those [blood pressure] medicines make us more sensitive to the sun and more likely to get a sunburn,” Quigley says, which amplifies the risk of skin cancer. Not all skin cancers are caused by sun exposure, so frequent skin checks are an important part of prevention, too. Catching a melanoma before it has time to grow in thickness and spread to other areas of the body greatly improves your chances of survival. (You can find tips on how to do a self-exam on the American Cancer Society’s website.) Keeping your immune system as strong as possible can also help prevent melanoma. The bottom line: “People need to really be aware of their skin,” Quigley says. “And if there’s anything that seems abnormal, it’s not the time to wait — it needs to be evaluated.”​ Editor's note: This story, first published July 9, 2021, has been updated to reflect new information.

As a result, older adults are increasingly susceptible to being swept up by the obesity epidemic overtaking the U.S. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 44.3 percent of people ages 40 to 59, and 41.5 percent of those 60 and older, are already considered obese. Numerous lifestyle and physiological factors can make losing weight even more difficult than it was when we were younger. Medical conditions that affect energy, stamina and mobility can affect our activity levels. Challenges sleeping, loss of muscle mass﻿, and declining estrogen and testosterone can also be factors in weight gain after 50. Unfortunately, as the pounds creep up, so do your chances for negative health effects. Being overweight or obese can put you at risk for health conditions like eye disease, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis, body pain and even cognitive impairment. With all the focus on weight loss drugs and surgery, it can be helpful to remember there are still science-backed approaches to reaching or maintaining a healthy weight without prescriptions or direct medical intervention. Just be sure to consult with your health care provider on any new weight loss plans and exercise routines before you begin. Understanding your BMI The first step on your weight loss journey may be taking a look at where your weight falls on the body mass index (BMI) scale. Medical professionals use BMI to determine whether someone is considered underweight (below 18.5), healthy weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9) or obese (30 or higher). BMI is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in meters squared. It doesn’t measure important health factors such as the amount of muscle you have, your age or how you carry weight. Weight and your health after 50 The relationship between our body and weight changes as we age, both in terms of gaining and losing weight, and shifts in what’s considered a safe weight. Being obese and having visceral fat can pose particular health problems for people in their 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond. Read more about what weight and health means in your: 50s 60s 70s and beyond It’s also important to remember that a healthy weight number can be different for different people. Some research has shown that people who were normal weight in early adulthood and gradually gained some weight in middle age and older (but did not get obese) can have the lowest mortality rates. The right weight for you should be determined in consultation with your doctor. If you are seeking to lose weight, it’s important to approach your journey with a focus on positive health outcomes. Fixating on dieting and weight loss can lead to negative body image, low self-esteem, eating disorders and malnutrition. Finding a weight management system that works for your lifestyle and that empowers you to feel your best and reach your goals is key to success. Calculate your BMI and learn how factors like age, race and gender can affect results. How do I lose weight fast? We’ve all been tempted to drop pounds fast for a special occasion or the dreaded weigh-in at the doctor’s office. But medical guidance recommends losing only 1 to 2 pounds per week, with the understanding that weight loss may fluctuate week to week. Losing weight too rapidly can result in lost nutrients, negative changes to your metabolism and lost muscle mass, which can be especially concerning for older adults. A slower, steadier pace can result in longer-term weight loss results and better health outcomes. It’s also important to not just focus on the scale, but to celebrate the increased muscle tone and stamina that can come from exercise, along with better health measures like reduced blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar levels. The guide below offers science-backed expert advice on various tools and recommendations to lose weight healthily and naturally.

Read more about what weight and health means in your: 50s 60s 70s and beyond Weight loss supplements While no over-the-counter vitamin or supplement will work on its own to cause weight loss, some may support your journey when combined with changes to your eating habits and exercise routine. Vitamins, including multivitamins, can help you avoid a nutrient deficiency while dieting. Additionally, vitamin B12 has been linked to weight loss and increased metabolism. Supplements aren’t typically approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and research has been mixed on their effectiveness for sustained weight loss, although a few have been shown to have a moderate impact. Some supplements can have serious side effects, especially when taken in larger quantities. It’s always important to speak with your health care provider before trying a weight loss supplement. Learn more about vitamins and supplements, including the science behind their role in weight loss. Best foods for weight loss As with supplements, no one food or beverage is the magic potion to make you instantly drop pounds. However, when combined with healthy eating patterns and regular exercise, sleep and stress maintenance, some foods can help burn calories. Foods that are high in fiber, such as apples and carrots, can help curb your appetite so that you eat fewer calories. And high-protein foods like eggs and nuts take longer to digest, which can leave you feeling more satisfied and less likely to overeat. Read more about key foods to help you to lose weight.

Effective diets for weight loss Knowing what diet may be the most effective for you can be challenging. Your medical history, food preferences, lifestyle and so many more factors come into play when picking a weight loss plan. That’s why it’s important to look at the pros and cons of the methods used in the diet, as well as potential pitfalls. Learn more about popular diets for weight loss, including Dash, MIND and Noom. Natural home remedies for weight loss Behavioral modifications can help with weight loss efforts, including tweaks to your daily routine and home life. These “home remedies” are backed by science and can include everything from using smaller plates for your meals to brushing your teeth after eating. Most important is to find techniques that resonate with you and will help you stick with your weight loss plans. Read more on home remedies for weight loss. Losing weight in your face Changes to our faces as we age are inevitable, and weight fluctuations can ﻿affect our facial appearance too. Whether it’s weight gain that causes a double chin or wider neck, or rapid weight loss that can increase wrinkles and sagging, body changes often show up in your face first. But you can take steps to maintain a healthy weight in your face. Read more about losing weight in your face. Exercises to lose weight In addition to helping with weight loss, adding exercise to your life is key to reducing stress and improving your energy, flexibility, stamina and balance, which are all especially important as we age. The most important part of starting a new workout routine is finding something that you enjoy. Whether it’s the basic cardio activity of walking, the muscle-toning benefits of strength training or a balance booster like tai chi, finding something you will stick with is key to success.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/knee-replacement-surgery/,"5 Things to Know About Knee Replacement Surgery It’s a common procedure for older adults with debilitating arthritis By Stacey Freed, AARP Comments En español Published January 28, 2025 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (2)) Nine years ago, Barbara Braverman’s knees were “no good.” The now 84-year-old, who lives in Newport Beach, California, could no longer play tennis or walk downhill without discomfort. “Even daily living, going up and down stairs was an issue,” she says. Braverman saw an orthopedist who diagnosed her with osteoarthritis — the most common type of arthritis — and said her knees had worn down to bone on bone, meaning the cartilage sandwiched between the bones had deteriorated. She spent about a year doing physical therapy, hoping to improve the situation. Braverman even got injections (cortisone and gel) in her knee in search of relief, “but I didn’t feel much better,” she says. “It was clear I needed to do something to enjoy the life I wanted to enjoy.” After speaking with her orthopedist, she decided on knee replacement surgery, or arthroplasty, and never looked back. It's a familiar story for many older adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 60 million U.S. adults are living with arthritis, and most of them are 50 and older. Worldwide, that number is half a billion, and 365 million of them have the degenerative joint disease affecting their knees. If you’re planning knee replacement surgery, here are five things to consider. What is knee replacement surgery? Your knee is made up of three parts: the femur, located at the lower end of the thighbone; the tibia, at the upper end of the shin bone; and the patella, or kneecap. Each of these has cartilage around their edges to cushion and protect your bones and to help them move smoothly. When a doctor tells you you’re “bone on bone,” it’s because that cartilage between the bones has worn down, most likely due to osteoarthritis, sometimes referred to as “wear and tear” arthritis. During a full or total knee replacement, your doctor will shave away the arthritic surfaces and install plastic and metal implants to the end of the femur, the top of the tibia and behind the patella. While the full knee replacement surgery is the most common, sometimes a surgeon will recommend a partial knee replacement. Imagine the knee as a house with three rooms, says Spencer Summers, M.D., a hip and knee replacement surgeon with New York’s Hospital for Special Surgery who is based in West Palm Beach, Florida. If only one or two of the rooms are damaged, you may be a candidate for a partial knee replacement in which only the damaged areas are renovated. While the recovery from partial knee replacement is often faster than the recovery for a full knee replacement, Summers advises patients that “the correct surgery is the one that sets them up for the best chance of long-term success.” Patients should discuss with their surgeon which is the best option for them, he says. How do I know if I need a knee replacement? Braverman’s experience is typical in that the first course of action when seeking treatment will most likely be non-surgical. Rishi Balkissoon, M.D., an adult reconstruction orthopedic surgeon at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) in Rochester, New York, says 80 percent of his practice is nonsurgical, meaning he’ll recommend wearing a brace, doing physical therapy or getting cortisone injections before considering surgery. Cortisone is a well-known steroid that can be “safely given every three months, and can happen lifelong if desired,” Balkissoon says. There are other injectables available, too — including hyaluronic acid, sometimes referred to as rooster comb or gel shots, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) — though Balkissoon says there’s not enough evidence to show they’re effective at treating chronic arthritis pain. Ultimately, your pain level and your need to continue living a life you enjoy will determine when you’re ready for a knee replacement. “When you’ve been managed with injections and your symptoms are persistent and you have documented evidence of arthritis on either an X-ray or MRI, that’s when you’re a candidate for a replacement procedure,” Summers says. What should I expect from surgery? The surgery, in which the surgeon makes a vertical cut down the front of your knee, takes 90 minutes to two hours. Based on your history, you and your doctor will discuss whether you’ll receive general or regional anesthesia. With general anesthesia, you will be completely under, and a tube in your airway will help you breathe. Regional anesthesia numbs just the area where the surgery will occur. It can be administered as spinal (a single shot) or epidural (continuously administered via catheter) anesthesia. Studies have shown that with regional anesthesia you should have fewer complications and shorter hospital stay compared with general anesthesia. In fact, Summers says, many patients go home the same day of surgery. Braverman says she had a general anesthetic and remained overnight. “But they had me up and walking right away,” she says, adding that before you are allowed to be discharged, “they show you how to sit, stand, go up the stairs — with the good foot first, followed by the bad foot — and get in the car.” What is the recovery like? Some pain is to be expected once you get home, but over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may be all you need to combat it. And because of improved pain control efforts and new nerve blocks given during surgery, Summers says, “we can make the whole knee extremely comfortable for patients for the first three days or so after surgery.” He adds that there had been a fear factor for patients around the pain, and many people put off surgery. But now, he says, when patients return for a check-in after two weeks “they tell me, ‘Hey that wasn’t nearly as bad as my friends told me it would be.’” You will need to use assistive devices such as a walker and a cane for a few weeks, Summers says. Shortly after surgery, you’ll begin to do physical therapy to get back your full motion. Many hospitals will send a physical therapist to your home — expect to keep it up for about six to eight weeks. Summers also sends patients a small stationary bicycle specifically used for knee replacement therapy. Often, insurance will cover this device. “It a good way for [patients] to do more exercise in the comfort of their home,” he says. What are the risks in knee replacement surgery? Blood loss is a common risk in knee replacement surgeries. For the past 15 years, Balkissoon says, most knee and hip reconstruction specialists have been using tranexamic acid during surgery to help provide clot stabilization and reduce postoperative blood loss. This has “dramatically reduced the potential for blood transfusions,” he says. Despite its wide use, tranexamic acid has not become the standard for care, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and other groups. Other risks include a small possibility of nerve or surrounding ligament damage. And, of course, there is always the possibility that you may have ongoing issues with your knees. But, according to the Cleveland Clinic, more than 90 percent of people who have knee replacement surgery have improved knee function for 10 to 15 years. Should I have both knees replaced at the same time? It’s not uncommon, as Braverman discovered, to have osteoarthritis in both knees. While some people undergo simultaneous (or bilateral) knee replacement surgery, it may not be the best solution for you. Making this determination requires a serious discussion with your surgeon. Summers says it’s rare for him to recommend having both knees replaced at the same time. “There are increased risks for things like needing a blood transfusion or having a blood clot because it is more surgery that you're undergoing in one stay,” he says. He usually advises his patients to “stage it out,” and have the second surgery around two months after the first one. “As I tell patients, you want to wait until you have a good leg to stand on before we do the other one,” he says. Braverman had her two knee surgeries nine months apart in 2016. Now, eight years later, she is playing tennis, walking, hiking, riding her e-bike — doing all the physical activities and traveling she has always enjoyed. And despite having two six-inch scars, she says, “I love my knees.” Stacey Freed is a contributing writer who covers remodeling, construction, lifestyle issues, education and pets.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/flu-shot-medication-interaction/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by 5 Medications That Interact With the Flu Shot Some drugs can make the influenza vaccine less effective By Terry Ann Donner, AARP Comments En español Published November 13, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (2)) Imagine showing up for a pain injection and your pain management physician cancels your appointment because you just received the flu vaccine. John Meyerhoffer, an 85-year-old retired police officer, has debilitating knee pain. He receives steroid injections every three to four months to manage his pain. “I went to my primary care doctor a week before my pain injection,” Meyerhoffer says. “We discussed my upcoming shot, and I got my flu vaccine.” When John hobbled into pain management for his injection the following week, he was sent home to wait for two weeks because he had received the flu vaccine. Getting a flu vaccine is an annual rite of passage for some 70 percent of Americans over age 65. What most flu vaccine recipients do not know is that there are several medications that can decrease the effectiveness of the flu vaccine Work with your doctor It is important to share what medications or treatments you are getting with your physician and pharmacist. Given the risk of death or serious complications with the flu, your physician or pharmacist can help you weigh the risk of delaying treatment with medication that could hamper your immune response versus getting the vaccine while taking such medication. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that 70 to 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths occur in older adults. Jodie Pepin, clinical pharmacy program director at Harbor Health in Round Rock, Texas, points out that when considering whether to delay a vaccine due to a potential drug interaction, you must weigh the risks and benefits. Here are five types of medications that can diminish the protection offered by the flu vaccine. 1. Steroid pain injections Steroid pain injections, also called corticosteroid or cortisone shots, reduce inflammation and pain by delivering medication into a joint or the epidural space around the nerves of the spine. These pain injections typically include a local anesthetic and a steroid that can minimize inflammation and pain for several months in some cases. A Mayo Clinic study analyzing more than 15,000 patients, who received steroid shots for pain in hips, knees, shoulders or other joints, found that those who got the injections a few weeks prior to the flu vaccine, experienced a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. “When getting an injected steroid in a joint or epidural space, you get some systemic absorption of the medication, which causes a transient dampening of your immune system,” says William Raoofi, M.D., of the Center for Interventional Pain Medicine at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, “Then when you are vaccinated and exposed to the weakened flu virus, your immune system is not as good at responding to it.” When suppressed, your immune system does not effectively recognize the inactive flu virus introduced by the vaccine. Then your immune system could fail to launch a strong attack on the live virus if you are exposed later. Raoofi adds that as you age, your body produces fewer and weaker immune cells that cannot remember the virus you were vaccinated against. Steroids can further weaken your ability to launch a strong immune response to protect yourself if you are exposed to the flu later. When an older adult comes into his office for a steroid injection and has received or plans to receive the flu vaccine within the next two weeks, Raoofi says he reschedules the appointment for two weeks after the vaccine. “It is a risk-benefit decision,” he says. Due to the high risk of death or complications for an older person with the flu, Raoofi says that it is important to leave a two-week window for the immune system to ramp up its response to the flu virus before receiving the steroid injection. 2. Oral prednisone Prednisone is a steroid that is taken orally to decrease inflammation, suppress an overactive immune system or replace cortisol. It treats conditions like asthma, arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Prednisone, combined with medications like cyclosporine, also suppresses the immune system after organ transplantation to prevent rejection. At doses of 20 mg per day for two weeks or more, prednisone can decrease your body’s ability to form antibodies, weakening your immune response to the flu vaccine. “High doses of steroids can weaken your immune system and potentially reduce the effectiveness of the flu vaccine,"" Pepin says. 3. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen and aspirin Over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers, taken before or after a flu vaccination, may also decrease your response to the vaccine. These medications include acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). Alcohol and the Flu Shot The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has found that if you drink a lot (5 drinks in a day for men and 4 drinks in a day for women) in one sitting, the alcohol slows your immune response for up to 24 hours. Drinking 24 hours before or after a flu vaccine can hinder your body’s ability to react to the vaccine and build immunity. Pepin recommends abstaining from drinking before you get the flu vaccine and for two weeks after being vaccinated to allow your immune system time to launch a full response. “When you get the flu vaccine, a lot of people will get a temperature of 99 degrees, malaise and pain at the injection site for up to 24 hours,” says Pepin. “This means your immune system is responding to the flu virus.” According to Pepin, taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen to prevent or reduce your temperature can reduce your ability to ramp up your immune response. If you are uncomfortable after the flu vaccine, Pepin recommends taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) which does not have an anti-inflammatory effect like NSAIDs and aspirin. However, she does not recommend taking acetaminophen until six hours after the vaccine to give your body time to start its immune response. Alcohol and the Flu Shot The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has found that if you drink a lot (5 drinks in a day for men and 4 drinks in a day for women) in one sitting, the alcohol slows your immune response for up to 24 hours. Drinking 24 hours before or after a flu vaccine can hinder your body’s ability to react to the vaccine and build immunity. Pepin recommends abstaining from drinking before you get the flu vaccine and for two weeks after being vaccinated to allow your immune system time to launch a full response. 4. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy The American Cancer Society confirms that chemotherapy and radiation therapy can diminish your response to the flu vaccine, and encourages consultation with your physician regarding the best time to be vaccinated. Pepin says it’s important to understand that chemotherapy drugs break down your immune system by attacking not only cancer cells, but also healthy cells. These healthy cells, often located in your bone marrow, produce immune cells that support your immune system. The result is that you will not be able to generate as many immune cells to remember and fight the strain of flu you were vaccinated against. 5. Biologics Biologics include medications that bind to certain proteins on immune cells to fight cancer cells or the inflammation that results when your own body attacks itself. Medications like atezolizumab (Tecentria), avelumab (Bavencio), durvalumab (Imfinzi), ipilimumab (Yervoy), nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) fight cancer. They help the immune system find and destroy cancer cells and may also damage healthy cells. Other biologics like etanercept (Enbral), adalimumab (Humira) and infliximab (Remicade) bind to proteins on immune cells to decrease the inflammatory response in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Pepin recommends consulting your physician to determine at what point in your therapy you should get the flu vaccine, keeping in mind that settling for limited protection may be better than delaying your vaccine.

But there’s another key nutrient found in many plant-based foods that functions like antioxidants and is getting a lot of attention. Researchers are taking notice and studying how they can help in the fight against chronic diseases and keep the body healthy. Say hello to polyphenols. ""There’s specific research that consumption of [polyphenols] can improve life quality, life expectancy, health in the prevention of cognitive aging and specifically Alzheimer’s disease,"" says Samantha Dieras, a registered dietician and director of ambulatory nutrition service at Mount Sinai Hospital. What are polyphenols? 11 Foods and Drinks High in Polyphenols Blueberries 525 mg/100g Blackberries 248 mg/100 g Raspberries 225mg/100 Strawberries 225 mg/100g Cranberries 120-315 mg/100g Coffee 200mg/ 100ml Green Tea 115mg/100ml Hazelnuts 291- 875 mg/100 g Pecans 1520 mg/100g Walnuts 1558-1625 mg/100g Olive oil 50-1000 mg/kg* *Based on olive ripeness, extraction technique and storage Polyphenols are molecules with both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that are found in plants and plant-based foods. ""The plant foods make polyphenols to protect themselves from the environment,"" says Beth Goodridge, a registered dietitian with Kaiser Permanente in northern California. ""When we eat plants that have polyphenols, it provides us with some protection, too."" You may have heard of some polyphenols, such as flavonoids and resveratrol, but there are more than 8,000 of these small molecules grouped into categories based on their chemical structures. Why are polyphenols good for you? ""The primary superpower [of polyphenols] is they act as an antioxidant in the body,"" says Goodridge. Antioxidants are natural compounds that neutralize unstable molecules or free radicals and protect the body. ""Free radicals disrupt the natural flow, "" says Goodridge. ""They cause mischief in the body,"" An accumulation of free radicals in the body damages cells, known as oxidative stress. Antioxidants help slow down the oxidative process and slow down aging. Helps older adults Polyphenols have many health benefits, especially for older adults. A 2022 review of health benefits of polyphenols in spices, published in Current Research in Food Science, notes that oxidative stress —an imbalance of antioxidants and free radicals in the body — is a major cause of many chronic diseases and aging cells. The authors said that polyphenols can help minimize cell damage due to oxidative stress. 11 Foods and Drinks High in Polyphenols Blueberries 525 mg/100g Blackberries 248 mg/100 g Raspberries 225mg/100 Strawberries 225 mg/100g Cranberries 120-315 mg/100g Coffee 200mg/ 100ml Green Tea 115mg/100ml Hazelnuts 291- 875 mg/100 g Pecans 1520 mg/100g Walnuts 1558-1625 mg/100g Olive oil 50-1000 mg/kg* *Based on olive ripeness, extraction technique and storage Provides health benefits Polyphenols can help with brain function and cognition. A systematic review published in Frontiers in Nutrition found that eating polyphenols for moderate and long periods may improve both working and episodic memory in middle-aged and older adults. One review published in the journal Antioxidants in 2022 hypothesized that polyphenols such as curcumin might help protect the brain by preventing the accumulation of the beta-amyloid plaques that are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Improves gut health Many foods that contain polyphenols also have fiber, which is important for regular bowel movements. ""Polyphenols can help with digestion, and that can help us in the restroom,"" says Goodridge. According to a study published in the Journal of Food Biochemistry in 2022, the gut microbiome transformed polyphenols into bioactive compounds that could have ""therapeutic effects"" on gut health. Helps with heart disease Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with one person dying every 33 seconds. ""One of the challenging things with heart disease is the inside of our arteries over the years can get rigid [and] stiff,"" says Goodridge. Arteries need to be elastic, yet oxidative stress can cause them to become rigid. ""Polyphenols can be protective of heart health,"" Goodridge says. Prevents negative effects of cell death Polyphenols can reduce cellular senescence. Cellular senescence occurs when cells die and accumulate in the body instead of leaving. They can leak harmful compounds, lead to inflammation and contribute to other coronary diseases, says Dieras. ""The number of cells that are in that stage accumulates as you get older,"" she says. Polyphenol-rich foods Many fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs, spices and beverages, such as green tea and coffee, contain polyphenols. The quantities of polyphenols vary based on the food or beverage, freshness, processing, and even the variety. Eating a healthy and varied diet helps ensure you're eating sufficient polyphenols. ""You're probably getting these within your diet if you're eating a diverse diet with fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds,"" says Dieras. There are also polyphenols in olive oil, whole grains and legumes. Plus, you get the additional benefits of fiber and vitamins when you eat these foods, she says. Brightly-colored fruits and vegetables, especially red-colored, are high in polyphenols, says Goodridge. Foods high in polyphenols include cranberries, pomegranates, red grapes, and berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and vegetables, like tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and onions, she says. (See box.) Eat a rainbow of colors for adequate nutrition throughout the week, says Goodridge. ""All the different colors help the body in different ways,"" she says. ""Color is mother nature's way of saying, 'I'm really good for you, whether that's a different polyphenol or a vitamin.'"" Why freshness matters Fresh produce has a higher nutrient content than fruits and vegetables that have been sitting in the fruit bowl or crisper drawer for a while. The longer it takes to consume fruit or vegetables after harvest, there's a steady decline in the bioavailability of the nutrients, says Dieras. ""A lot of the nutrients, including the polyphenols, can oxidize and degrade over time,"" she adds. Have a lot of produce that you aren't going to eat quickly? Keep produce cool. ""Polyphenols are delicate,"" says Goodridge. Store produce in the fridge to preserve some of the polyphenols, she says. Fresh produce has higher polyphenols than canned produce. ""There's going to be a higher polyphenol content in foods that are fresh versus cans,"" says Goodridge. ""Freshness definitely matters."" How much do you need? There are guidelines for how quantities of macronutrients, such as protein, you should be consuming daily. So, you may wonder if polyphenols have similar recommendations. ""There is no guideline yet for the amount of polyphenols that adults should eat every day,"" Goodridge says. In lieu of such recommendations, track the number of servings of fruits, vegetables and whole grains you eat in a day. ""For example, you want to have at least a cup and a half of fruit a day and at least two and a half cups of vegetables or more,"" says Goodridge. Half of your consumption of grains, at minimum, should be whole grains, such as brown rice or wheat bread for your daily amount, she says. By doing this, you'll be including an adequate amount. of healthy polyphenols in your diet. Should you take supplements? People may reach for a supplement when they're concerned that they're not getting an adequate intake of a vitamin, mineral or, in this case, polyphenols. Nutritionists recommend the best way to get polyphenols is with food. When you eat foods with polyphenols, you're also getting important macronutrients, such as fiber and micronutrients, like vitamin C, says Goodridge. The body absorbs polyphenols better in food than when they are isolated in a supplement. ""The other components in a food help those polyphenols to be digested and absorbed appropriately,"" says Goodridge. ""You don’t get that when it’s just a supplement."" Be aware that medications can interact with polyphenol supplements. ""A significant part of the population above 50 is on multiple medications,"" says Dieras. ""I don't know specifically how the individual polyphenols will interact with their medications."" Before you seek out supplements, you should always speak to your medical provider about any risks or adverse effects that could occur. ""It's important to speak to your provider to figure out all the medications that you're on, how they interact with each other, and how [a polyphenol] supplement would interact with those,"" says Dieras.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/acid-reflux-and-gerd/,"What are Acid Reflux and GERD and How Can You Relieve Symptoms? The conditions can be unpleasant — but there are diet strategies and drugs that help Jim Craigmyle / Getty Images By Barbara Stepko, AARP En español Published October 27, 2021 Anyone who’s ever reached for an antacid tablet after a really good Thai meal or been abruptly awakened from a restful slumber, gasping for air, can tell you this: Acid reflux is a killjoy. Even less fun? When it becomes a chronic condition known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The discomfort is caused by stomach contents flowing upward into the esophagus, where they lead to symptoms like heartburn. Some people also experience regurgitation, an acidic or bitter taste in their mouths, or chest pain. “Have you ever done shots in a bar?” says Gulchin Ergun, M.D﻿., a gastroenterology specialist in Houston and ﻿professor of ﻿medicine in ﻿digestive ﻿disorders at Houston Methodist Hospital. “That’s what it feels like — an uncomfortable burning sensation.” During an episode of nighttime acid reflux, you may find yourself choking or coughing uncontrollably when that acid finds its way up. Difficulty swallowing or the sensation of a lump in your throat are ﻿also common symptoms. Why is this happening? Everybody needs acid in their stomach — it helps break down food for digestion and kills bacteria. “It’s a defense mechanism and it’s pretty strong,” Ergun﻿ says. “Normally, you don’t buy things to clean your house that are as strong as stomach acid. But the stuff in your stomach doesn’t usually come up into your chest. There are mechanisms that the body has created for that.” At the bottom of the esophagus is a circular band of muscle, called the lower esophageal sphincter, which separates it from the stomach. It ﻿generally remains closed, but when we eat and swallow﻿, ﻿this valve relaxes to let food and liquid pass through to ﻿the stomach, then closes again. Acid reflux occurs when the valve opens when it’s not supposed to, so the stomach contents — be they food, acid or digestive juices — flow backward. It’s normal for that valve to open from time to time, allowing us to let out a discreet (or hearty) burp. But problematic reflux can cause heartburn, especially after a meal or when you lie down to doze. GERD is chronic acid reflux that becomes problematic. According to the American College of Gastroenterology, it’s believed that as many as 20 percent of ﻿U.S. adults suffer from it. Age can be a factor.﻿ Just as our skin gets looser as we get older, the bundle of muscle that makes up the lower esophageal sphincter﻿, as well as the supporting structures of the stomach, may not be as taut, ultimately creating more leeway for digested food to gravitate upward. Producing less saliva — which helps neutralize acid in your esophagus as it goes down — after a certain age can also play a role, Ergun says. Severe GERD symptoms can cause damage Ignoring persistent symptoms of GERD can damage the esophagus, since the constant backwash of acid irritates the lining and can cause scar tissue to form over time. “That scar sometimes is helpful, tightening up the area so material doesn’t come up that easily, but it’s at the expense of the esophagus not working right, limiting the food that’s going down,” Erg﻿un﻿ says. A normal esophagus is 20 millimeters in diameter﻿, Erg﻿un says﻿, ﻿and when it gets to about half its typical diameter, people start to notice food — something like bread or meat — getting stuck. GERD can also ﻿affect tissue that lines the lower esophagus. “Instead of the cells of the esophagus being consistent with the cells of the stomach, they change — a condition known as Barrett’s esophagus,” says Nipaporn Pichetshote, M﻿.D﻿., a ﻿gastroenterology ﻿specialist in Los Angeles affiliated with Cedar﻿s-Sinai Medical Center. “That’s concerning because there is a risk for progression into esophageal cancer.” ﻿Though she says the likelihood of this is quite low, it becomes something to watch in people who “have reflux disease for ﻿10 years.” Another concern: Acid reflux and cardiac problems can sometimes mimic each other. “People will say, ‘Oh, I have indigestion’ and assume it’s the esophagus, when it could be the heart, or vice-versa,” Ergun ﻿says. If you’re experiencing chest pain, address it with your doctor to make sure it isn’t something other than acid reflux. You may also want to pay your physician a visit if you’re experiencing severe GERD symptoms or find yourself popping antacid medication more than twice a week.﻿ “If symptoms are becoming more troublesome or not being controlled by lifestyle changes or medications, or you have alarm symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing, we want to investigate further to make sure there’s no other changes in the esophagus that could cause problems down the line,” says Neena Mohan,﻿ M.D., ﻿assistant ﻿professor of ﻿clinical ﻿medicine in ﻿gastroenterology at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University. Patients may require further evaluation with an endoscopy — during which a thin tube equipped with a camera is slid down the throat to examine the esophagus to look for changes. How to banish the burn “Lifestyle changes can be very effective for those with mild to moderate acid reflux,” says Pichetshote. Start with these tweaks and see if they help. Avoid certain foods. To find what triggers your acid reflux, Mohan recommends keeping a food journal that includes what you eat and any symptoms that flare up afterwards. You may notice fried and fatty foods in particular cause trouble. “There are chemical components in these foods that can affect receptors in the lower sphincter muscle, causing it to relax,” Mohan says. What’s more, she says, because foods with greater fat content can take longer to digest, they may sit in your stomach longer. And the longer that food stays there, the more likely it is to be refluxed back into your esophagus. Another potential trigger? Carbonated beverages, which can cause acid reflux by expanding our stomach, Pichetshote﻿ says: “When we distend our stomach, it can cause a relaxation or lowering of the lower esophageal pressure.” Other foods are direct irritants, such as ﻿citrus fruits. Alcohol has a low pH and irritate﻿s the esophagus and stimulate﻿s acid production. Coffee can be on the acidic side, depending on how potently it’s brewed. “If you drink something and it burns going down, it’s a good hint that it will bother you if you have too much,” Ergun﻿ says. It’s also been shown that people take longer to consume acidic foods. “They take smaller bites, so the acid is in the esophagus much longer than something that is more neutral, like a piece of bread,” says Pichetshote. Eat regularly throughout the day. Overeating is never a good idea, but an empty stomach can cause problems﻿, too. Go more than three to four hours without chowing down and stomach acid collects. Eat small meals — and drink water — throughout the day. Don’t eat before bed. Nocturnal acid reflex is a real concern. “Normally, someone who is sitting upright will swallow saliva and neutralize that acid,” Ergun﻿ says. “But if you’re sleeping, it could be sitting in your esophagus for a while.” Wait at least two to three hours after eating before you go to bed. And watch how﻿ you sleep. “Liquid and gas want to go to the path of least resistance,” Pichetshote﻿ says. “If you’re lying flat, it can easily go up toward your head. If you’re sleeping a little more upright, it has to fight gravity.” Elevate your head six to eight inches by buying a wedge pillow or slipping a wedge-shaped piece of foam underneath your mattress. Some research suggests that lying on your left side can reduce acid reflux. “There’s a pocket in our stomach that has a little more acid than the rest of our stomach,” Pichetshote﻿ says. “When we sleep on our right side, the pocket becomes closer to our esophagus and that can give us more reflux.” Drop some pounds. Obesity or overeating can also up your chances of having GERD by increasing your intragastric (stomach) pressure. “If you had a baby and fed it, you would not squish its stomach because the food would come right back up,” Ergun﻿ says. “Well, having an extra 30 pounds of abdominal fat, which is where most people get the extra weight, is the same as squishing the belly. It’s easier for material to come up into your chest.” Even a ﻿10 percent reduction in weight can cause a significant reduction in symptoms, notes Pichetshote. Hit the gym. Being active can help with reflux as well. “The muscles around the lower esophagus can actually get stronger when you exercise, making the area tighter,” Pichetshote﻿ says. “When you have acid in ﻿your stomach, there’s more of a barrier so it doesn’t go up into your esophagus.” Don’t down meds without water. Certain medications — among them, aspirin and ibuprofen, bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss, and some antibiotics — can worsen reflux-related heartburn. What’s more, if they break down before they reach the stomach, they can irritate the lining of the esophagus. Reflux Rx’s and when to consider surgery If lifestyle tweaks aren’t doing the trick, you might consider medication. Over-the-counter antacids neutralize stomach acid and offer fast relief. ﻿At the next level of treatment, for moderate to severe acid reflux, are H2-receptor blockers (Tagamet and Pepcid), which reduce the production of acid ﻿in your stomach. “H2 blockers don’t completely block acid production but affect it enough that people feel improved, and they work pretty fast,” Ergun﻿ says. The next choice: proton pump inhibitors (Prevacid and Prilosec). Stronger than H2﻿-receptor blockers, they block stomach acid secretion and giv﻿e damaged esophageal tissue time to heal. ﻿These drugs are helpful when you have esophagitis or Barrett’s esophagus. And, unlike H2 blockers, you don’t have to take them two or three times a day. Many are found over the counter, but a doctor can prescribe them in higher doses. The good news: GERD can usually be tamed with medication. But if the problem is persistent, your doctor may suggest using a medical procedure or surgery to get things under control. Laparoscopic fundoplication is one such treatment. During this minimally invasive procedure, a surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter to tighten the muscle and prevent reflux.﻿ “The two major components of gastro reflux are heartburn and regurgitation,” Ergun﻿ says. “When you have heartburn, if you block the acid, the heartburn gets better. You’re preventing what comes up from being as noxious as it normally is. But although pills may take care of the acid, they won’t do anything for the reflux barrier, which is why people will say, ‘The heartburn is gone, but I still have regurgitation.’ That’s evidence there’s a mechanical problem, such as hiatal hernia, and that’s when surgery makes the biggest difference.” Watch: Foods That Help Get Rid of Acid Reflux Barbara Stepko is a longtime health and lifestyle writer, and former editor at Women’s Health and InStyle.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/norovirus-stomach-bug-symptoms-prevention/,"Stomach Bug? It Could Be Norovirus What to do if you catch the highly contagious virus — and tips for avoiding it during outbreaks RealPeopleGroup / Getty Images By Rachel Nania, Updated January 02, 2025 AARP En español Published March 23, 2023 / Updated January 02, 2025 You’re fine one minute, and the next, it hits you: stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. You’ve got a stomach bug. And while a few different germs could be to blame, chances are it’s the dreaded norovirus, the most common cause of these symptoms. Each year, norovirus sickens about 20 million Americans and causes around 900 deaths, mostly among adults 65 and older. If it seems like you’re seeing more of it now, you’re not wrong. Cases surged in November and December of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And while norovirus outbreaks are most common between the months of November and April, the number of outbreaks recorded during the first week of December, the latest data available, was well above previous years. Common Symptoms of Norovirus Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain The very nature of norovirus makes it hard to dodge. For starters, the intestine-inflaming virus spreads quickly and easily among people; you can also pick it up from contaminated foods and surfaces. Plus, it’s what University of Maryland infectious disease physician Wilbur Chen describes as a “hearty” virus. It can survive on surfaces for long periods — we’re talking hours, even days. And it only takes a few virus particles to make you sick. Meanwhile, infected individuals can shed billions. Preventing norovirus Still, experts say there are a few steps you can take to help prevent a bout with the bug. And the most important is the most basic. “When talking about norovirus, and really any other virus, the best way to prevent yourself from getting sick is not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth unless you’ve washed your hands first,” says Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic. There’s a cringe factor to how norovirus is transmitted: by tiny particles of feces (poop) or vomit from an infected person. If someone has norovirus and doesn’t wash their hands after using the restroom and then goes to touch a doorknob, others can pick it up if they touch the doorknob and then touch their mouth. The same goes if that infected person shakes another individual’s hand or handles food. (Food like fruits and vegetables can also get contaminated when washed or grown with contaminated water.) Common Settings of Norovirus Outbreaks Health care facilities, including nursing homes Restaurants/catered events Schools and child care centers Cruise ships Source: CDC And an important note on cleaning your hands: “Alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't work so well against norovirus, so washing your hands well with soap and water is critical and important,” says Sabrina Assoumou, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of medicine at Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine. Soap and water — a vigorous scrub for about 20 seconds — can break up the virus’ structure much better than alcohol-based gels and sprays. If someone in your house comes down with norovirus, limit the amount of sharing that happens with food and utensils, Assoumou advises. And clean surfaces frequently and thoroughly. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a list of cleaning products that are effective against norovirus. You can also use a solution of 5 to 25 tablespoons of household bleach per gallon of water (2 percent to 10 percent), the CDC says. Finally, because norovirus is the leading cause of illness from contaminated food in the U.S., it’s important to wash fruits and vegetables and to cook oysters and other shellfish thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Common Symptoms of Norovirus Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain Common Settings of Norovirus Outbreaks Health care facilities, including nursing homes Restaurants/catered events Schools and child care centers Cruise ships Source: CDC What to do if you get it Unfortunately, if you do come down with norovirus, there’s no medicine to treat it. “The big thing is hydration,” Binnicker says. “That’s what’s going to put most people in the hospital with norovirus, is getting dehydrated.” About 465,000 people head to the emergency room each year with norovirus, and more than 100,000 are hospitalized with it. Water, sports drinks and over-the-counter rehydration drinks can help to replace fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhea, the CDC says. Just steer clear of anything with alcohol or caffeine. And pay attention to your symptoms — this is especially important for older adults, who are more susceptible to dehydration. If you start to feel dizzy or lightheaded or notice you haven’t urinated in a while, that could be a sign of severe dehydration, which requires medical attention. Another reason to see a doctor is if your symptoms don’t let up after a few days. The good news is, most of the time norovirus leaves as quickly as it comes on; people start to feel better within one to three days. That said, you can still spread the virus to others even a few days after you’re feeling fine, Binnicker says. “So, it’s really important, even after you get better, after you’ve stopped having symptoms, to continue to really be diligent about washing hands, especially if you’re in a household with other people,” he adds. More reason the keep up the hand hygiene: Immunity to norovirus is short-lived. Plus, there are different types of noroviruses, and infection with one will not protect you from another. Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

The article discusses norovirus, a highly contagious virus that causes stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and is the most common cause of these symptoms. Key findings include the importance of hand hygiene, specifically washing hands with soap and water, as well as avoiding close contact with others and contaminated surfaces to prevent the spread of the virus. A surprising insight is that alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against norovirus, and that people can still spread the virus even after they have stopped showing symptoms. Proper hydration is also crucial if infected, as dehydration is a major concern, especially for older adults.",158
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/poop-and-health/,"What Your Poop Can Tell You About Your Health The #1 reason to pay attention to your #2? It offers clues to potentially serious conditions By Rachel Nania, Updated March 01, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 13, 2021 / Updated March 01, 2024 Getty Images The topic may be taboo for cocktail conversation —﻿ and it’s definitely not discussed at the dinner table — but ﻿fecal matter, when it comes to health, is an important matter. ﻿ That’s because what comes out of your body can tell you a lot about what’s going on inside of it. Changes in your stool can reflect changes in your diet, mood and physical activity; some shifts can even signal more serious conditions. Before you start obsessing over your bowel movements, know that “everybody’s stool varies some from time to time,” depending on what you eat, how much you move and the medicines that you’re taking, among other things, says William Chey, M.D., professor of gastroenterology and nutrition sciences at Michigan Medicine﻿ at the University of Michigan. So best “not to overinterpret” it. What is Poop? It may be hard to picture, but poop is the remaining part of the food that you ate — the bits that your body didn’t want. After the small intestine absorbs all the nutrients the body wants and needs from your food, it passes what’s left (the digestive waste) to the large intestines, where it changes from a liquid to stool and starts making its way out of your body. Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases On the other hand, “it’s also really easy to ignore things and not worry when you do need to,” Chey adds. The key is to know your normal. Some people poop a few times a day; others go a few times a week. When you want to start paying attention is “if you have an abrupt change in your bowel habits and it lasts more than a day﻿.” Here are a few things to be on the lookout for. Red, maroon or black poop One of the more concerning changes is blood in the stool, which can appear red, maroon or even black. Bright﻿-red blood often indicates that the bleeding is coming from the lower end of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract — “and it’s almost always from hemorrhoids,” Chey says. A little bright﻿-red blood can also be ﻿due to a small tissue tear inside the tush. Darker blood that shows up almost black suggests bleeding higher up in the GI tract, such as in the stomach or the small intestine. If you notice this, it’s important to consult your doctor. “One concerning explanation would be a tumor or a large polyp that has gotten big enough that it’s developed a blood supply that has begun to bleed intermittently,” says Nitin Ahuja, M.D., a gastroenterologist and associate professor﻿ of clinical medicine at the Perelman ﻿Center for Advanced Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Ulcers can also bleed ﻿anywhere in the GI tract, he notes. But know, too, that there are other, less distressing reasons that your waste may appear red or black. “Someone who takes a new affinity for beets, for example﻿ — ﻿﻿that would be a competing explanation for consistent change in color toward red,” Ahuja says. And taking iron supplements or bismuth subsalicylate (better known by its brand name﻿ Pepto-Bismol) can turn your stool black — so can black licorice or a meal of squid-ink pasta. What is Poop? It may be hard to picture, but poop is the remaining part of the food that you ate — the bits that your body didn’t want. After the small intestine absorbs all the nutrients the body wants and needs from your food, it passes what’s left (the digestive waste) to the large intestines, where it changes from a liquid to stool and starts making its way out of your body. Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Pale poop If your poop appears pale and even seems to float in the toilet, it may be an indication that your pancreas, an organ that aids in digestion, isn’t working normally, Chey says. ﻿Very smelly poop that looks greasy or oily can also point to problems with the pancreas, according to ﻿the Mayo Clinic, and may mean that your body is having trouble digesting fat. A problem with the liver could be another reason for pale poop, since the organ is responsible for releasing the bile that typically gives feces its brown hue. Be sure to talk ﻿with a doctor if either of these issues — pale or greasy stool — persist﻿s for more than a few days, especially if you’re experiencing weight loss or abdominal pain alongside it. The Bristol Stool Scale Getty Images How often are you going? Consistency is another important feature to pay attention to — and﻿, along with it, frequency. If you’re someone ﻿who ﻿releases soft stools every day, for example, and then you’re suddenly not able to go — or can produce ﻿only pencil-thin ﻿feces﻿ — it could point to an obstruction, like a mass or lesion, somewhere in your GI tract, says Reezwana Chowdhury, M.D., a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Trouble going can also be diet﻿ related. Increasing your water and fiber intake — try more fruits, vegetables and whole grains — can help with constipation. So can exercise. “I tell many of my patients who have issues with constipation: The more you move, the more your gut moves,” Chowdhury says. “A sedentary lifestyle does slow your gut down.” Constipation also becomes more common with age. “Things just slow down” as we get older, Chey ﻿explains. Often, people are less active, their diets change﻿ and they’re taking more medications. Add all ﻿those factors together and you have a greater likelihood of experiencing constipation. The Bristol Stool Scale Getty Images If your issues lie on the opposite side of the spectrum and your bowel movements are frequent and watery (diarrhea), it may be ﻿due to something you ate or a sign that your body is fighting a virus or struggling with a food intolerance. Diarrhea is common and usually goes away on its own, according to Ahuja. But if it lasts more than a few days, it could signal a more serious problem. Another thing to be on the lookout for: ﻿having loose stools and frequent trips to the bathroom at night. “We always tell people that if they’re having diarrhea at night, they need to see their doctor, because that indicates that there’s some underlying disease, like inflammatory bowel disease, or microscopic colitis or celiac disease. There’s something else going on,” Chey says. Stay on top of screenings Any sudden changes in your bowel behaviors that last more than a day or two warrant a call to your doctor, who may order a colonoscopy “just to make sure that there’s no inflammation or evidence of cancer or something else that might have led to that abrupt change in your bowel habits,” Chey says. Adults 45 and older should get regular colorectal cancer screenings, according to the American Cancer Society. One option is a colonoscopy every 10 years; an alternative is a stool-based test, which is ﻿taken every ﻿one to three years. People at higher risk for colon cancer may need to be screened earlier and more often. “The parting line is going to be﻿, ﻿when in doubt, talk to a physician.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/blood-test-for-alzheimers/,"A Simple Blood Test for Alzheimer’s? ‘It’s Not That Far Away’ Doctors could soon have a new tool to help them diagnose the most common form of dementia By Rachel Nania, Updated July 29, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published January 25, 2024 / Updated July 29, 2024 Danielle Del Plato A new study adds to a growing sense of optimism that doctors could soon have a faster, simpler and more affordable way to tell if a patient’s symptoms of memory loss and confusion are caused by Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia that affects nearly 7 million older Americans. A team of researchers based in Sweden found that a blood test was about 90 percent accurate in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease in people experiencing thinking and memory problems. In the research study, primary care physicians were 63 percent accurate in an Alzheimer’s diagnosis when not using the blood test; specialists were 73 percent accurate when not using the test, which identifies a specific protein in the blood that serves as an indicator for the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, two defining characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease. The study was presented at the 2024 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference and published in the medical journal JAMA. This blood test and others like it are not widely available to patients outside of research studies, but they could be soon, and that would be a “revolutionary change,” says Paul Newhouse, M.D., director of the Center for Cognitive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and clinical core director for the Vanderbilt Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. What doctors rely on now when making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis is a patchwork of physical and cognitive tests and pricey brain scans or invasive spinal taps. With more studies like this latest one, blood tests could “serve as the first line of defense in diagnosing the disease,” Howard Fillit, M.D., cofounder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said in a statement. A study published earlier this year in JAMA Neurology examined the accuracy of a blood test that identifies the same protein in the blood, called p-tau217. The research team found that the blood test was more than 90 percent accurate and was on par with the gold-standard diagnostic tools — positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid collected from a lumbar puncture — in detecting the brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Previous studies have produced promising results, too, so evidence continues to build for the use of blood tests in clinical settings, says Ronald Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. “I think this is a step forward; this is important. This is something that the field has been waiting for,” Petersen told AARP. What are the benefits of a blood test? For starters, a highly predictive blood test could save a lot of time and money when it comes to making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, Newhouse says. PET scans and spinal taps can cost thousands of dollars and are performed only in hospitals or specialty clinics. A faster diagnosis could impact access to new Alzheimer’s treatments that are approved for patients in the early to mild stages of the disease. Research presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s 2024 conference suggests that the wait time for these treatments could be slashed by several years with an accurate and reliable blood test. “Currently, eligible patients are falling outside of the treatment window because it takes so long to receive a diagnosis. An easy-to-use blood test could help address that problem,” researcher Soeren Mattke, M.D., director of the Brain Health Observatory at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said in a news release issued by the conference. Another potential implication: Screening individuals for Alzheimer’s disease, even if they don’t have symptoms. Research shows that Alzheimer’s changes in the brain can start years, sometimes decades, before symptoms begin. Enrolling people in clinical trials who are in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s could help identify treatments that get to work before life﻿-changing symptoms take hold. How long before blood tests are widely available? It’s hard to say with certainty, but Babak Tousi, M.D., head of the Clinical Trials Program at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, predicts blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease will be widely available in the next few years — possibly sooner. “Widely” is the key word here. There are already commercially available blood tests doctors and researchers can use to assist in making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. But so far none have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and insurance coverage is lacking, so they’re not commonly used in clinical settings. The FDA’s approval is not required for laboratory-developed tests, like these blood tests, but many dementia experts say it’s needed to confirm their accuracy and reliability in a patient population, and therefore to boost their widespread use. Once a blood test is FDA-approved and accepted as an alternative to PET scans and lumbar punctures for an Alzheimer’s diagnosis — and insurers agree to reimburse the cost — we’ll see its full potential to impact Alzheimer’s care, says Anna Nordvig, M.D., a neurologist who specializes in cognitive disorders of the brain at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.﻿ The Alzheimer’s Association has also said it is working on guidelines for the use of blood tests. Concerns about your memory? Talk to your doctor It’s not just clinicians and researchers who can order an Alzheimer’s blood test. The first direct-to-consumer blood test designed to assess a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s hit the market in 2023 without FDA approval — and more could follow. But when it comes to these products, the advice from many dementia experts is cautionary. For one, the results won’t reveal whether you have Alzheimer’s disease; they’ll tell you whether amyloid is present in your blood plasma, explains Zaldy Tan, M.D., medical director of the Jona Goldrich Center for Alzheimer’s and Memory Disorders at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. The problem with that, he says, is some people test positive for amyloid but never go on to develop the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “My worry with direct-to-consumer is that people might make life decisions or other important decisions based on one blood test, which may not mean what they think it means,” Tan says. “I liken it to getting a cholesterol level. Getting a cholesterol level doesn’t mean that you are going to have a heart attack tomorrow.” A recent poll from the University of Michigan supports this concern. Researchers found that a significant share of older adults (74 percent) said a positive result from an Alzheimer’s blood test would make them believe they were likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease; nearly two in three adults (64 percent) said such a result would likely cause them significant distress. And nearly 80 percent of those surveyed said they would consider changes to their financial or advance care planning if a blood test result came back positive. “[Patients] need someone to put results in context,” Tan says. If you have concerns about your risk for Alzheimer’s, talk to a doctor — you can start with your primary care physician. There are things you can do that may help lower your risk, such as manage high blood pressure and treat hearing loss. Another reason to speak with your doctor: If you’re experiencing memory loss symptoms, it could be due to another medical condition, including other forms of dementia. “Not all forgetfulness is Alzheimer’s disease,” Petersen says. Side effects from medications can mimic symptoms of dementia — so can common infections, depression, sleep issues, even a vitamin deficiency. Your doctor can help rule out these other potential causes first and, if needed, refer you to a specialist for further evaluation — possibly even a blood draw in the near future. “There’s no doubt that there is an absolute urgency, and everybody recognizes that [a blood test] is the Holy Grail,” says Maria Carrillo, Alzheimer’s Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead. “And it’s not that far away.”﻿ Editor’s note: This story, first published Jan. 25, 2024, has been updated to reflect new research.﻿ Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/depression-facts/,"7 Things Everyone Should Know About Depression Who's at risk, common symptoms, and how to get help and ease the pain Getty Images By Barbara Stepko, Updated September 29, 2023 AARP En español Published November 20, 2020 / Updated September 29, 2023 We've all had moments in our lives when we feel sad or down in the dumps. But if weeks go by and those feelings linger, it may be depression. More than mere sadness, depression can suck the joy out of life and leave you feeling overwhelmed — in some cases, unable to function. The good news: Depression is very treatable. Before taking action, here are seven things to know about this common condition. 1. Depression can hurt. Literally Sadness is a symptom we're all familiar with, but depression symptoms aren't limited to the mind. “In older people, depression tends to manifest itself more often with physical symptomology than in younger people. ‘I hurt more. I just don't feel right physically,'” says Bruce Sutor, M.D., a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota. Common symptoms: headaches, joint pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite and gastrointestinal issues. And if left untreated — which happens all too often when doctors are trying to get to the bottom of aches and pains and not asking about possible emotional issues — it can have dire consequences. The combination of mental and physical pain can be debilitating. In fact, clinical depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Says Sutor: “We tell our primary care colleagues, ‘If you've got people coming in with different physical complaints that you just can't get to the bottom of, start thinking depression.'” 2. Women are particularly prone to depression Women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed than men, according to the Mayo Clinic. Some suspect this is due to hormonal fluctuations, particularly during menopause. Others believe that women may be more prone to chronic stress — say, the kind that might come from taking care of an elderly parent — which can take a toll and lead to depression. But it may also be that depression simply shows up differently in men, who often appear angry or irritable, rather than sad, says Brian P. Cole, an associate professor of counseling psychology at the University of Kansas. He notes that this tendency can be traced back to boyhood, a time when many men are socialized to believe that it is unacceptable to show vulnerability. “It is important that we normalize the fact that men get depressed and that it is acceptable to seek help from family, friends and professionals,” Cole says. 3. Symptoms of depression can look different when we're older Some of us are genetically predisposed to developing depression. If you have depression, your first-degree relatives — parents, full siblings, offspring — have a two-to-three times greater chance of having it as well. But long-term stressful life situations and the challenges of aging — such as chronic illness or increasing disability, isolation, the death of a spouse or struggling to adapt to retirement — can also increase someone's risk of developing depression. Unfortunately, the disorder often goes untreated in older adults, in part because their depression can be challenging to diagnose. Their symptoms are often different than those of younger adults, says Ipsit Vahia, M.D., interim chief of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry , at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Rather than the “classic” symptoms of sadness, fearfulness or hopelessness, they tend to display symptoms such as irritability, a lack of motivation or energy, or a disruption in sleep patterns or appetite. “There's also a tendency to start withdrawing,” says John F. Greden, M.D., founder of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Depression Center. “That's what families notice first.” Many older adults — and even many clinicians — don't recognize these symptoms as depression, especially because they often overlap with symptoms of other health conditions. Depression and dementia are especially easy to confuse, says Vahia. 4. Depression can affect your heart ""It's been fairly clear for the last 20 or so years that there is a link between depression and heart disease, and the evidence continues to accumulate,” says Robert Carney, professor of psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. Indeed, research appearing on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website states that adults with a depressive disorder or symptoms have a 64 percent greater risk of developing coronary artery disease, compared to those without depression. “Depression doesn't hold the same risk as, say, high cholesterol,” says Carney, “but it's close.” There are a number of possible explanations. Among them: People who are depressed and those who develop heart disease seem to share certain inflammatory markers. Also, says Carney, “Depressed people tend to have less heart rate variability. Their heart is not as responsive to changes in activity levels, and they tend to have higher heart rates overall, than people who are not depressed. These are factors that can lead to a cardiac event.” Finally, there are the behavioral aspects of the disorder. Depressed people are more likely to be more sedentary, more likely to be smokers, and less likely to follow the recommended dietary guidelines — all things that can lead to ticker trouble down the road. But according to a 2014 study from Indiana University, early treatment for depression — before the onset of cardiovascular disease — may slice the risk of heart attacks (and stroke) by almost half. 5. Antidepressants combined with therapy seems to be the most effective treatment Antidepressant use among all ages jumped an eye-opening 65 percent between 1989 and 2014, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “But medication isn't always warranted,” Sutor says. “With mild to moderate depression, there's good evidence that people can respond to certain types of psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavior therapy.” CBT, as it's known, teaches new ways of thinking and behaving, and offers help in changing habits that may be contributing to depression. ""For managing major depressive disorder, antidepressants in combination with psychotherapy seem to work more effectively than either form of treatment by itself,” says Vahia. In a 2020 review of several studies on antidepressant success rates, the NIH reported that when patients are treated without antidepressants, about 20 to 40 out of 100 people who took a placebo saw their symptoms improve within six to eight weeks. For those treated with antidepressants, about 40 to 60 out of 100 people noticed an improvement in the same time period. Prescribing antidepressants isn't a precise science. Similar to treating high blood pressure, it takes time to figure out the right medication. “About 35 percent of people will respond to the first antidepressant they're put on,” says Maria A. Oquendo, M.D., chair of psychiatry at University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine and president of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “By the third trial, about 65 percent will respond."" Particular care needs to be taken when prescribing antidepressants to older patients. “Age-related changes can change the way medicines are metabolized,” says Jon Stevens, M.D., chief of outpatient services at the Menninger Clinic, in Houston, Texas. “Then there's just the fact that older folks tend to be taking medication for other health problems, so there's a higher chance of drug-drug interaction.” 6. Certain behaviors — especially exercise — can boost your mood ""Managing depression is about more than just ‘Take this pill,'” says Sutor. “It's also engaging in healthy behaviors that can help to move the depression along.” Probably the simplest, most effective treatment is exercise. “I have never seen anyone get better from depression sitting on their couch,” says Stevens, who notes that there is a proven body-mind connection. A 2016 study in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that regular moderate-intensity aerobic exercise had “a large and significant antidepressant effect in people with depression,” including major depressive disorder. What's more, it appears that even modest levels — say, taking a brisk walk around the neighborhood — may have benefits. Other lifestyle tweaks can supply a lift. There's evidence that eating healthy —such as, a Mediterranean diet, chock-full of fruits, vegetables and whole grains — can help reduce symptoms of depression. A study out of Boston University School of Medicine has found evidence that mindfulness — focusing on the present through breathing exercises or yoga moves — can not only offer relief from symptoms during each session but cumulatively, over time, as well. And let's not forget the power of social interaction. A study in The American Journal of Psychiatry focused on 106 modifiable factors that might affect people's risk of depression and found that “far and away the most prominent of these factors was the frequency of confiding in others.” 7. (More) help may be on the way Would you believe ... Botox? The drug, commonly injected to erase wrinkles, ease migraines and stop excessive sweating, is currently being tested in clinical trials for its ability to treat depression. In the study, published 2020 in Scientific Reports, researchers combed through almost 40,000 reports from the FDA's Adverse Effect Reporting System, containing reports of people who had experienced adverse events while taking a medication. What they discovered: People who got Botox injections — in the forehead, neck and limbs — reported depression significantly less often than patients undergoing different treatments for the same conditions. And a 2022 review article published in Toxins noted that a series of clinical trials and meta-analyses in the last decade have shown Botox can reduce symptoms of mild to moderate depression. One hypothesis: Botox may travel to parts of the central nervous systems involved in mood and emotions.

It is the first blood test to be cleared by the FDA for the disease, which affects more than 7 million older Americans and is marked by a decline in memory and thinking skills. The test, called Lumipulse, can detect abnormal clumps of protein in the brain, known as amyloid plaques. These plaques disrupt brain cell function and are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. PET scans and spinal fluid tests can also detect amyloid plaques and have been used for years to help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s. But the tests are expensive and, in the case of the lumbar puncture, invasive. They can also be inaccessible for people in rural areas. Lumipulse, on the other hand, requires only a blood draw in patients 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of the disease. “Having a blood test just makes it so much easier in being able to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,” said Charles Bernick, M.D., a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, based in Las Vegas. In its news release, the test’s manufacturer, Fujirebio Diagnostics, didn’t specify the cost of the test. People without symptoms shouldn’t test The newly approved blood test measures two proteins in the liquid part of the blood, known as plasma, and then calculates the ratio of these proteins, which is “correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan,” the FDA said. The test is only meant for older adults who are experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease; it is not a screening test. What’s more, the FDA said, the results should be used along with “other clinical evaluations or additional tests” to determine treatment options. In addition to brain imaging and lumbar punctures, doctors often use neurological exams and cognitive tests, for example, to diagnose a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. “It still becomes a diagnosis where you have to really look at the whole picture,” Bernick said. In recent years, the FDA has approved two medications for the treatment of Alzheimer’s — Kisunla (donanemab) and Leqembi (lecanemab). These drugs, which are given by infusion, don’t cure the disease but can help to slow the rate of decline in people in its early stages. Because they work by clearing amyloid plaques from the brain, the presence of amyloid must be confirmed before they can be prescribed. “They carry some risk. So if you’re going to use them or utilize them, you’ve got to be pretty sure the person has that protein in the brain,” Bernick said. Risks can include swelling and bleeding in the brain. New test could ‘revolutionize’ research and clinical care Some Alzheimer’s specialists have already been using blood tests not cleared by the FDA to help with a diagnosis of the disease. The FDA’s approval is not required for laboratory-developed tests such as these blood tests. Having the agency’s sign-off, however, confirms a test’s accuracy and opens the door for insurance coverage and more widespread use. Expert groups applauded the FDA’s May 16 announcement. Howard Fillit, M.D., co-founder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said that there’s been a “tremendous need” for blood tests and that having one will “revolutionize clinical care and clinical research” for Alzheimer’s. “It’s going to reduce the cost of care and diagnosis, and it’s going to give people the opportunity to get a definitive diagnosis and enter into clinical trials,” Fillit told AARP. “Today marks another important step in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis,” Maria C. Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead at the Alzheimer’s Association, said in a statement. “For too long, Americans have struggled to get a simple and accurate diagnosis; with today’s action by the FDA we are hopeful it will be easier for more individuals to receive an accurate diagnosis earlier.” Fillit predicts that we’ll see more blood tests in the near future, including tests that detect other key features of Alzheimer’s disease, such as inflammation in the brain. Having such tests could help doctors tailor a patient’s treatment as more medications come online. “It’s kind of going to look like cancer, where patients have a tumor, there’s a biopsy of the tumor, the tumor cells are taken to the lab, they’re characterized according to various biomarkers, and then a treatment plan with various drugs in combination is designed for the patient, and the patient receives multiple drugs affecting multiple pathways in the cancer cell,"" Fillit said. ""We’re going to have that for Alzheimer’s disease in the future. So this is just the beginning of really going into a new age of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and care and clinical trials.” Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a 3-sentence summary of the article:

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/what-is-plant-based-diet/,"What is a Plant-Based Diet? You may have heard of the diet — here’s what it means and why it can be good for your health By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published October 26, 2023 Dusan Stankovic / Getty Images It may seem like the trendy newcomer on the diet landscape, but plant-based eating has actually been around for a while — as in a few millennia. And as far as the definition is concerned, health experts say it’s pretty straightforward. “A plant-based diet is just that — a dietary pattern based mostly on whole plant foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains,” says Liz Weinandy, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Instructor of Practice in Medical Dietetics. That’s not to say meat is entirely out of the picture with a plant-based way of life. “It absolutely can contain animal products such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy,” Weinandy says. “But the focus is on plants.” In other words, it is not the same as vegan (which allows plant-based foods only) or vegetarian (vegan, plus eggs and dairy). A plant-based diet more closely resembles the pescatarian (basically, vegetarian plus seafood) and flexitarian (vegetarian with the occasional inclusion of meat or fish) eating plans. And research suggests it’s being embraced by a growing number of people who have their own reasons for wanting to fill their plates with more plant-based foods and less animal protein. According to a recent Nielsen poll, 12 percent of those who responded said they’re trying the plant-based approach to eating, which is second only to those choosing plans touted as heart-healthy (14 percent). The Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that 63 percent of Americans are actively trying to eat less red meat. Many are in pursuit of health, while others choose a plant-based diet out of concern for animal welfare, or as a way to reduce their environmental footprint. What foods are allowed on a plant-based diet? Fruits and vegetables, of course, but also nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains, legumes and beans. The goal, however, isn’t to eat only plants, just mostly plants. “Try to fill half to three-quarters of your plate with whole foods,” like those listed above, Weinandy says. The rest “can be animal-based like a high-quality protein,” such as fish and chicken as opposed to highly processed meats and animal products like sausage, lunch meat, bacon and hot dogs. What about all the plant-based products taking up an increasing amount of space on grocery store shelves? (We’re talking about all the plant-based drinks, meat and dairy substitutes.) Weinandy suggests avoiding them if you’re following a plant-based diet for health reasons (as opposed to animal and/or environmental concerns). The reason? Many of the meat substitutes “are highly processed and contain a large amount of saturated fat, which we know increases the risk of high cholesterol and heart disease,” she says. If you’re choosing a meat substitute as a way to make sure you get plenty of protein without deviating from your plant-based approach, opt for tofu, legumes or lentils instead. Research shows that all of these are high-quality sources of protein. What are the health benefits of a plant-based diet? Any plant-based eating plan would seem to get an automatic gold star from nutritionists, but it depends on your food choices. If you’re regularly filling your plate with a variety of fresh, whole foods, the health benefits are not unlike other similar plans. A plant-based diet — which essentially includes the Mediterranean Diet, MIND Diet, and DASH Diet — is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, better diabetes management and prevention, and kidney health, Weinandy says. But the health benefits dwindle considerably if you’re filling your plate with highly processed “plant based” foods — you’ll find the phrase printed on the packing of chips, energy bars and meat substitutes. Just because something comes from a plant doesn’t make it healthy, says Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian for the Cleveland Clinic. Cookies, chips, and sugar-sweetened beverages may all be derived from plants, but that doesn’t mean they’re nutrient dense or benefit health when consumed on a regular basis.” Her advice — whether you’ll following a vegan, plant-based or semi-vegetarian diet — is to fill up on nutrient-dense foods and to limit those that are high in sugar and lack fiber. Also important: Make sure you get enough high-quality protein. If you’re not sure how much you should be getting on a daily basis, consult a registered dietitian to figure out how much protein you need and how you can make sure you’re meeting that daily quota. Tracking food intake with an app is one way to do that. Can you lose weight on a plant-based diet? A number of studies have linked plant-based diets to a lower BMI (short, for body mass index, an estimate of body fat) and some research suggests that switching to a plant-based diet can help with weight loss, depending on how the diet is followed. While one review of studies, published in the Journal of Geriatric Cardiology, found that it’s effective for weight loss, another suggests the opposite can be true if a plant-based plan relies too heavily on ultra-processed foods. “A major reason so many people gain weight and keep that weight on is by eating too many calories from ultra-processed foods which are hyper palatable,” Weinandy says. “Hyper palatable foods like potato chips and ice cream are often hard to eat just a small amount of. When a person limits these foods, they usually take in fewer calories and lose weight.” Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Researchers at the University of Cambridge’s department of psychiatry and the Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence at Fudan University in Shanghai did, and they discovered seven hours is the optimal amount of shut-eye if you are 40-plus. ​ Finding the sweet spot in terms of how long you should sleep is particularly important for older adults. Studies have demonstrated a link between sleep duration and the risk of developing Alzheimer’s and dementia. “Getting a good night’s sleep is important at all stages of life, but particularly as we age,” says Barbara Sahakian, a Cambridge psychiatry professor and one of the study’s authors. “Finding ways to improve sleep for older people could be crucial to helping them maintain good mental health and well-being and avoiding cognitive decline, particularly for patients with psychiatric disorders and dementia﻿s.” More or less than seven hours can harm cognitive performance To determine how much sleep is ideal to achieve optimal brain function and mental health, researchers from the UK and China tapped the UK Biobank, poring over data from close to 500,000 adults ages 38 to 73. Participants in the UK Biobank were asked questions about their sleeping patterns, mental health and well-being. The study participants also underwent cognitive tests. Brain images and genetic data were available for about 40,000 of the adults. After analyzing the data, the scientists found too little or too much sleep hurt cognitive performance including processing speed, visual attention, memory and problem solving. Seven hours of sleep, however, improved cognitive performance and mental health. People suffering from anxiety and depression reported worse well-being if they slept too little or too long. The results of the study were published in the﻿ journal Nature Aging. ​It’s the why of it that researchers are now trying to unearth. One possible reason for cognitive decline with too little or too much sleep could be disruptions to deep sleep, a type of sleep that is closely linked to memory consolidation and the clearing of amyloid, a protein that when misfolded causes knots in the brain that are characteristic of some forms of dementia. The wrong sleep duration may also prevent the brain from unloading toxins, which could hurt cognitive performance. The researchers also said the findings indicate that insufficient or excessive sleep could be a risk factor for cognitive decline as we age. A panel of experts with AARP's Global Council on Brain Health said in a 2016 report that sleep is vital to brain health. The panel recommended seven to eight hours of sleep each day. How to get a better night’s sleep If you are getting too little or too much sleep, here are strategies you can employ to improve your sleep patterns. ​Create a sleep schedule.﻿ It’s hard for your body to get into a sleep routine if you go to sleep and wake up at different times every day. Putting yourself to sleep on a schedule will get your body and brain accustomed to going to sleep and waking up at the same time. ​Don’t nap too much. Taking a nap during the day is enticing, but if you sleep too long it could disrupt your sleep patterns at bedtime. According to the Sleep Foundation, the best time to nap is right after lunch, in the early afternoon. Naps should last only around 20 minutes. ​​Create a calming bedtime environment. Tossing and turning at night can be avoided if you create a calm environment before going to sleep. That means engaging in some quiet activity such as reading a book, listening to soft music or stretching 30 minutes prior to bedtime. Stay away from bright lights and disconnect from smartphones, laptops and tablets that will keep your brain awake. ​Limit your caffeine and alcohol intake near bedtime.﻿ Sound slumber will be hard to come by if you are hyped up on caffeine or have a cocktail right before bedtime. That’s why experts say to avoid caffeine late in the day and alcohol right before you hit the sheets. ﻿ Donna Fuscaldo is a contributing writer and editor focusing on personal finance and health.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/sneaky-signs-heart-disease/,"10 Sneaky Signs You May Have Heart Disease Bad breath and hip pain could mean you are having cardiovascular problems﻿ By Nicole Pajer, Updated February 06, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published February 11, 2022 / Updated February 06, 2024 Andre Rucker Chances are you’re aware of the classic signs of a heart attack: the crushing chest pain, the shortness of breath. But what about heart disease? ﻿ This killer doesn’t always strike with a big bang; some indicators of ticker trouble are far less obvious than others. Here are 10 little-known signs that you may have heart problems. 1. You struggle to breathe when lying flat If breathing is hard when you sleep on your back but often improves when you sit upright, you may have fluid buildup in the lungs, which can indicate heart failure. “When you lie flat, your blood volume gets redistributed,” says Jim Liu, M.D., a cardiologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “The heart can have problems pumping this extra blood volume, and this can lead to increased shortness of breath due to increased fluid in the lungs.” This condition, known as orthopnea, needs a doctor’s immediate attention. Snoring can also be a red flag. Sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea, “is associated with metabolic syndrome, which is associated with heart disease,” says Eleanor Levin, M.D., clinical professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Between 40 and 80 percent of people in the United States with heart disease also have obstructive sleep apnea, according to the American Heart Association. Sleep apnea can worsen heart disease, which in turn can worsen sleep apnea. 2. You have leg or hip pain (or both) while walking Lower-body pain can result from injuries, arthritis or being out of shape, but it may also signal circulation problems in the legs from peripheral artery disease. “Much like blockages in the heart arteries can cause heart attacks, blockages in the leg arteries can cause pain when walking,” says Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., ﻿director of Mount Sinai Heart and Dr. Valentin Fuster Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Health System. If large leg arteries are clogged, smaller arteries in the heart probably are too.﻿ Circulation-related pain often occurs when you exercise and ends when you stop (the obstruction limits the amount of oxygen reaching the muscles). “When you stop walking, you don’t need that much oxygen and the pain goes away,” says Levin. 3. You experience erectile dysfunction … Diabetes or chronic stress can cause erectile dysfunction (ED), but it may be a sign of budding heart disease, says Michael Blaha, M.D., director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. ﻿ ED is often a blood-flow problem, and risk factors — from smoking to hypertension — are similar for vascular ED and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (hardening of the arteries). The root cause of both issues is endothelial dysfunction, in which blood vessels have difficulty expanding and contracting properly, which reduces blood flow to the heart and the penis. 4. … or vaginal dryness Blood-flow issues aren’t limited to men. In one study, 84 percent of men and 87 percent of women with heart failure reported some degree of sexual dysfunction. For women, the signs can include vaginal dryness and a lack of libido and clitoral sensation: Endothelial dysfunction leads to less elastic blood vessels, which impairs blood flow to the sexual organs. “The first step of developing cardiovascular disease, or coronary artery disease, is the endothelial dysfunction,” says Ernst von Schwarz, M.D., a cardiologist, researcher and clinical professor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the University of California Los Angeles. This leads to blood vessel issues as well as blood-flow abnormalities, plaque formation, artery calcification and blockage, and, eventually, a heart attack. ﻿ To complicate matters, many women experience vaginal dryness as a symptom of menopause. According to research from AARP, 33 percent of women age 35 and older report this symptom when going through menopause. 5. Your ankles are swollen When the heart isn’t efficiently pumping blood, fluid can swell both legs. In a study of adults with no history of cardiovascular disease, fluid in the lower extremities was associated with future hospitalizations for heart failure. ﻿ Swelling can also occur when veins in the legs can’t return fluid to the heart. In cases related to heart failure, swelling often occurs in both legs. Swelling in one leg could be due to a blood clot or an infection. Call your doctor if leg swelling is accompanied by heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath. 6. You’re fatigued for no reason If everyday activities make you tired — like needing to rest while making the bed — you may have an obstructed coronary artery. Most women cite fatigue as their first symptom before having a cardiac event, says Jean McSweeney, professor emerita at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences College of Nursing. Fatigue can occur months before a heart attack and may result from lower blood flow to the heart. If you feel unusually tired from mundane activities, call your doctor. 7. You wake up to pee Waking up to pee isn’t only due to chugging too much liquid before bed. A weak heart pumps less blood to the kidneys, which can result in fluid buildup and swollen ankles and legs. At bedtime, gravity drains fluid in the legs back to the heart. The kidneys have more fluid to filter, increasing the need to pee. Nighttime urination may increase with age, especially in men with enlarged prostates and women with incontinence issues. But waking more than once a night to pee is concerning, says Bhatt, especially if paired with swollen ankles. 8. You have bad breath Bad breath is caused by out-of-control bacteria, and it can damage more than your social life. Bacteria can enter your bloodstream through bleeding or diseased gums, which is linked to inflammation, clogged arteries and stroke. “There’s a correlation between people who have periodontal disease and people with cardiovascular disease,” says Florida periodontist David Genet. “While there may not be a direct cause and effect between medical diseases such as heart disease and dental health, they are closely interrelated. That connection is an important reason for us to schedule regular dental cleanings as part of our annual health screenings,” he added. 9. You spot fatty growths Known as xanthomas, these lesions feel like calcium deposits in the tendons, and they can indicate sky-high cholesterol. Tendon xanthomas typically occur near the ankles and elbows, and are especially prominent in people with a family history of high cholesterol. One study found that the risk of cardiovascular disease was three times higher among those with familial hypercholesterolemia — a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol. 10. You’re feeling nauseous Unexplained queasiness could be a sign of heart failure, says Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Nicholas Ruthmann, M.D. When the heart struggles to pump blood, fluid and pressure can build up in the lungs, abdomen and lower extremities. Bloating and water retention may lead to nausea, feeling full quickly and decreased appetite. There’s also a link between queasiness and heart attacks (women are more likely to report nausea as a heart attack symptom). Those with heart failure or a heart attack history should watch for persistent nausea that occurs with bloating, weight gain, swelling in the legs or ankles, and shortness of breath. If these symptoms occur alongside acute chest, jaw or shoulder pain, call 911.﻿ Editor’s note: This story, first published Feb. 11, 2022, has been updated to include new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/protect-eyes/,"Brought to you by 10 Everyday Things You Can Do to Protect Your Sight Stick with these healthy habits to lower your risk of eye problems as you age By Barbara Stepko, AARP Comments En español Published November 11, 2021 Getty Images By the year 2050, an estimated 895 million people worldwide will ﻿have develop﻿ed ﻿vision impairment, according to a report in The Lancet. That’s a 150 percent increase over the next 30 years. It’s estimated that by age 65, more than 90 percent of people have a cataract﻿ and ﻿that half of people between ages 75 and 85 have lost some vision due to a cataract. By ﻿age 80, 1 in 8 people have glaucoma﻿, according to an Australian study﻿. In the U.S., African Americans ﻿are at particularly high risk.﻿ ﻿Still, as ominous as these statistics sound, many vision problems can be treated — and in some cases prevented — by following some simple, healthy habits. 1. Wear sunglasses with ﻿ultraviolet (UV﻿) ﻿protection﻿ Our skin isn’t the ﻿only casualty of daily UV exposure. Those invisible rays up your chances of getting cataracts, a clouding of the eye lens that typically occurs with aging. Look for ﻿sunglasses with a label that says “100 percent protection against ﻿both UV﻿A and UVB” or “100 percent protection against UV 400﻿.” “A dark lens that does not filter out the UV properly is actually worse than no lens at all,” says Andrea Thau, past president of the American Optometri﻿c Association and a New York City-based optometrist, “because that dark tint makes your pupil dilate and invites more UV radiation to enter the eye.” ﻿Also, look for ﻿glasses that have a uniform tint. If you spend a lot of time outdoors, consider wraparound sunglasses that protect from UV rays that can sneak in ﻿around the sides of the sunglasses. If you’re in contact with airborne materials — ﻿by cutting wood﻿, for instance, or mowing grass — consider safety glasses or protective goggles. Getty Images 2. Eat right Carrots may get all the press, but it’s those dark﻿-green leafy vegetables (think spinach, kale, collard greens) that are vision-protecting powerhouses. They are full of ﻿the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. Experts suggest these nutrients may block high-energy blue light, which can harm retinal cells, helping to protect vision and prevent the progression of age-related macular degeneration﻿ (AMD). Eggs are another excellent source of lutein and zeaxanthin. Add more color to your plate with carrots, sweet potatoes, butternut squash and red bell peppers. These orange and red veggies are rich in beta-carotene, which the body uses to make vitamin A, which is essential for good vision. There’s also evidence that omega-3 fatty acids — found in salmon, tuna and sardines — can increase oil production, helping to prevent dry eye. “Omega-3 supplements have also shown to be helpful,” says Davinder S. Grover, M.D., clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and ﻿an ophthalmologist in Dallas﻿. Not wild about seafood? Nibble on nuts, legumes or seeds.​ If your diet is missing key vitamins or nutrients, or ﻿if you have a diagnosed deficiency, ask your doctor about supplements. Research has shown that a specific kind of high-dose dietary supplement, called AREDS, may be beneficial in patients with intermediate ﻿age-related macular degeneration, slowing its progression﻿ and preventing it from turning to late AMD. 3. Exercise Couch potatoes, take note. A Swedish study, published in the journal Ophthalmology, examined a possible link between specific types of physical activity, including walking, ﻿and ﻿a reduced risk of age-related cataracts in 52,660 participants﻿ between the ages of 45 ﻿and 83. Hoofing it more than 60 minutes a day — versus hardly ever — was associated with a decreased risk of cloudy lenses. Conversely, high inactivity levels may be associated with an increased risk. Another eye-opener: According to research from ﻿the University of California Los Angeles, brisk walking may also lower your risk of getting glaucoma, with the most active among us having a 73 percent lower risk ﻿than the least active. Getty Images The benefits may be two-fold. First, exercise is believed to decrease your risk of developing ﻿type 2 diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure﻿, all of which can contribute to cataracts. Cardio may also lower intraocular pressure (the pressure in your eyes﻿)﻿, increasing blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. To achieve vision-boosting effects, you don’t have to break much of a sweat﻿: IOP can be lowered with a brisk, 20-minute walk a minimum of four times a week. 4. Get the right amount of sleep Yes, bloodshot eyes and puffy lids can be﻿ the unattractive ﻿consequences ﻿of a lack of shut-eye, but not getting enough rest can play havoc with our eye﻿ health, too. Sleep is the time when fluids circulate and hydrate your eyes, refreshing them for the next day. Get less than five hours of slumber a night and you may experience side effects ranging from light sensitivity and blurred vision to dry eye and involuntary twitches (known as myokymia) that occur ﻿when the muscles around the eyes﻿ are not ﻿getting enough rest. 5. Give your eyes a break If you’re staring at a computer screen or doing another task that requires visual concentration, take frequent breaks to give your eyes a rest. Try the 20-20-20 rule: Look away from the screen every 20 minutes, focusing on something 20 feet in the distance for at least 20 seconds. “Get into the habit of blinking every few seconds,” says Thau. “Make sure that your upper and lower lids are truly touching, not a halfway blink.” This will help ﻿spread a fresh layer of tears over the surface of your eyes. Glare can strain eyes, making it difficult to see objects on your monitor. Consider turning off some of the overhead light or plac﻿ing an anti-glare cover over the screen. Keep the screen about an arm’s length away﻿, and make sure ﻿it’s at the right height. “Our eyes do best when the top of the monitor is at eye level and we’re looking down into the screen,” says Thau. You won’t have to open your eyes wide when viewing the screen. 6. Practice good eye hygiene No matter how tired you may be, remove all traces of eye makeup before bed to prevent morning-after irritation. “Makeup can clog your oil glands﻿, and when they’re clogged they are not producing oil,” says Nichole Moos, an optometrist affiliated with VSP Vision Care. “Tears evaporate﻿, and that also drives dry eyes and inflammation.” Clean and gently massage ﻿your lids at the base of the lashes with a washcloth and baby shampoo (or a mild cleanser like Cetaphil), diluted with warm water, to loosen any debris that’s collected around the lids during the day. Even better, pick up a package of pre-moistened lid wipe or an over-the-counter scrub designed for lids and lashes, such as OCuSOFT. And don’t let your makeup hang around for too long. Preservatives can break down, allowing bacteria to grow — leading to irritation or﻿, worse, a nasty infection. Many cosmetics have an expiration date or a period-after-opening (PAO) symbol, which tells you how long a product is safe to use after it’s been opened.﻿ But ﻿remember, a product can go bad before it reaches that date. If something seems “off” with the formula — say, a funky smell or a change in consistency or color — toss it immediately. People who wear contact lenses need to be especially careful about keeping them clean. Dirty lenses can cause eye infections, so clean them nightly, ﻿then rinse ﻿them using a sterile saline solution﻿ before inserting them in eyes.﻿ (In one eye-opening survey, contact wearers admitted using lemonade, beer and butter to clean their lenses!) Rub the lens gently with your index finger in the palm of your other hand to remove surface buildup﻿, ﻿then let﻿ it ai﻿r dry. And don’t forget to wash and dry ﻿your hands thoroughly before handling those tiny pieces of plastic. Your contact lens case should be replaced every three months. 7. ﻿Get regular eye exams ﻿“We recommend a general eye exam every one to two years,” says Merina Thomas, M.D., a retina specialist and ophthalmologist at Oregon Health & Science University. “If you have a family history of eye disease, especially glaucoma or MD, you should get an eye exam once a year.” However, a Harris/AAO survey found that while almost 70 percent of adults see a primary care physician or family medicine doctor regularly, just 52 percent of those polled see some type of eye care professional on a regular basis. ﻿That’s problematic﻿, since age-related eye diseases — such as cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and macular degeneration — are more treatable if diagnosed and treated early.﻿ “The most silent common blinder of losing sight without any symptoms is glaucoma,” says Grover. “It’s asymptomatic and a silent thief of vision. But when caught early and treated appropriately, it’s highly preventable.” ﻿The benefits of an appointment with your ophthalmologist or optometrist go well beyond keep your eyes in working order. A close inspection of the lens, retina and optic nerve can reveal a host of systemic disorders — high blood pressure and diabetes, among them — sometimes before there are ﻿any other symptoms. 8. Keep eyes well﻿ moisturized Tears do more than send us running for the Kleenex after a viewing of It’s a Wonderful Life. They lubricate our eyes, keeping them healthy and helping our vision stay crystal clear. Dry eye happens when eyes aren’t getting adequate lubrication. It could be that ﻿they aren’t producing enough tears (after age ﻿50, tear production tends to decline) or ﻿that the tears they do produce are of poor quality an﻿d evaporate too quickly. ﻿Some medical conditions (for example, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes) and certain medications (including antihistamines and blood pressure meds) can also trigger dry eye. You may experience a stinging or burning sensation or gritty feeling in your eyes — or, ironically, watery eyes (that dryness prompts glands to produce more tears). For mild symptoms, artificial tears, or lubricating eye drops, supplement tear production and keep the outer surface of the eyes moist and comfortable. You can buy ﻿them over the counter and use them as needed. Artificial tears with low viscosity are watery and offer fast, temporary relief. That soothing effect won’t last long, so you have to use them frequently. Artificial tears ﻿with high viscosity have a thicker, gel-like consistency. They stick around on the surface of the eye longer and provide longer-lasting lubrication. Typically, they ﻿blur your vision for several minutes after you apply them, so they are recommended for bedtime use, to moisturize eyes while you sleep. People who suffer from severe, long-term symptoms might consider topical prescription drops, which target the underlying cause of dryness and help increase tear production. Simply drinking more water may also ﻿keep your eyes ﻿better lubricated. Omega-3 fish oil supplements, in the triglyceride form, may also help ease symptoms, says Moos, who also suggests applying a warm compress to closed eyes for ﻿10 minutes to soften and unclog the oil glands along the lids. Another suggestion: Up the humidity in the air at home by sleeping with a humidifier next to your bed. 9. Watch your glucose levels People w﻿ith diabetes — ﻿type 1 or ﻿type 2 — are at risk for a disease called diabetic retinopathy, in which consistently elevated blood-sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, the thin layer of tissue ﻿at the back of your eye.﻿ In its early stages, you may not even know you have it. But as it worsens, your vision takes a hit. It may fluctuate between clear and blurry. You may get floaters, poor night vision, dark or empty areas in your vision, or colors that appear faded. Left unchecked, it can lead to vision loss. Following a healthy diet is key. That means cutting out sugar and refined carbs — and, yes, staying away ﻿from processed foods. Following the Mediterranean diet — lean proteins, such as chicken and fish, non-starchy vegetables and fruit — is ideal. And watch your weight. Carrying excess pound﻿s, especially in the abdominal area, can promote insulin resistance. 10. Don’t smoke If you’ve had trouble kicking your smoking habit, use these facts for motivation: You are two to three times more likely to develop cataracts and twice as likely to develop ﻿AMD ﻿as﻿ a nonsmoker. “If you have early signs of age-related macular degeneration, smoking increases the risk of it progressing tenfold,” says Thomas. “It can get much worse much more quickly.” Why? Among other reasons, cigarettes contain ﻿hundreds of toxins﻿ that ﻿can cause oxidative stress and prevent proper blood flow ﻿from reach﻿ing the eye. And that irritating smoke can damage the tear film, increasing your risk of dry eye (not to mention the many other health problems associated with smoking).

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/dash-diet-lower-blood-pressure/,"View Series What Is the DASH Diet? Experts say it’s a good one to try if you’re looking to lower your blood pressure By Kimberly Goad, Updated April 26, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published August 02, 2023 / Updated April 26, 2024 VladSt / Getty Images High Blood Pressure Treatments High blood pressure stages and types Hypertension causes and symptoms High blood pressure treatment, management and prevention Breathing exercises to lower blood pressure Blood pressure medication side effects Tart cherry juice and hypertension What’s the effect of a particular diet on lowering blood pressure? That’s the question researchers set out to answer in the ’90s when they randomly assigned 456 people to one of three diets: 1. What they called “a standard American diet,” emphasizing red and processed meats; refined grains, including white rice and white bread; sweets; and sugar-sweetened beverages. 2. A diet similar to the standard American diet, except with more fruits and vegetables and fewer snacks and sweets. 3. A diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains; moderately high in lean protein such as low-fat dairy, fish and chicken; and high in minerals and fiber. Each of the three diets provided around 3,000 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, which is more than the recommended daily limit of 2,300 mg, but less than the average sodium intake for Americans (3,﻿500 mg per day). Diets number 2 and 3, however, were richer in fiber as well as nutrients such as potassium, magnesium, calcium and protein — all of which are thought to help lower blood pressure. The landmark study, which was published in 1997 in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the third diet — the one chock full of fruits, veggies, whole grains and some lean protein — was more effective in reducing blood pressure than the other two. What’s more, participants with high blood pressure (hypertension) who were assigned to the third diet showed greater decreases in blood pressure than those without hypertension. In the years since, researchers have found that what’s known as the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol (the “bad” cholesterol), which along with high blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. No surprise, then, that DASH tops the list of the American Heart Association’s top 10 heart-healthy diets. High Blood Pressure Treatments High blood pressure stages and types Hypertension causes and symptoms High blood pressure treatment, management and prevention Breathing exercises to lower blood pressure Blood pressure medication side effects Tart cherry juice and hypertension What foods are allowed on the DASH diet? Specific foods include fruits and vegetables, low-fat and no-fat dairy, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans and nuts. Because sodium has a very clear impact on heart health — research shows the risk of cardiovascular disease increases up to 6 percent for every 1-gram increase in sodium — the DASH plan recommends reducing sodium to about ﻿2,﻿300 mg per day, with a lower-salt version of the diet recommending no more than 1,500 mg per day (the amount in ¾ teaspoon of salt). Also recommended: limiting sweets to no more than five servings per week; avoiding foods rich in saturated fat (including whole-fat dairy and red meat); and drinking alcohol only in moderation, since alcohol can raise blood pressure. Also recommended: limiting sweets to no more than five servings per week; avoiding foods rich in saturated fat (like whole-fat dairy and red meat); and drinking alcohol only in moderation, since alcohol can raise blood pressure. The DASH Diet Foods to eat: Vegetables Fruits Whole grains Fat-free or low-fat dairy Fish Poultry Beans Nuts and seeds Vegetable oils Foods to limit: Fatty meats Full-fat dairy Sugar-sweetened beverages Sweets Sodium (salt) Source: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute But the DASH diet isn’t so much about individual foods as it is about the overall eating plan. Research shows that eating a variety of foods with nutrients that lower blood pressure has a greater effect on blood pressure than focusing on individual foods or nutrients. With DASH, “the main focus points are reducing sodium and getting enough calcium in,” says Liz Weinandy, an outpatient dietitian and clinical instructor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “While it promotes many of the same healthy foods as the Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet specifically reduces sodium and encourages three servings of low-fat dairy daily, as calcium has been found to help lower blood pressure.” Worth noting: If you’re lactose intolerant, you may need to make adjustments, such as choosing lactose-free or lactose-reduced milk. What are the health benefits of the DASH diet? If you have high blood pressure — and more than two-thirds of people over age 65 do — your doctor may have already recommended the DASH diet for one very simple reason: It lives up to its name. Research shows that the reduction of blood pressure among people who follow the DASH diet is comparable to that of people who take medication for stage 1 hypertension. That’s not all. Research published in 2020 in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatology suggests it may reduce the risk of gout, a painful inflammatory condition that’s common in people with hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, by lowering levels of uric acid in the blood. “The focus is really on lowering blood pressure and, secondarily, to help lower LDL cholesterol to improve heart health and reduce the risk of stroke,” Weinandy says. “If you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, or you’re concerned about heart health for any reason, this is the diet to focus on. Everyone’s blood pressure will creep up with age, so this diet could be especially beneficial for those over 50.” The DASH Diet Foods to eat: Vegetables Fruits Whole grains Fat-free or low-fat dairy Fish Poultry Beans Nuts and seeds Vegetable oils Foods to limit: Fatty meats Full-fat dairy Sugar-sweetened beverages Sweets Sodium (salt) Source: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Can you lose weight on the DASH diet? DASH wasn’t designed for weight loss, but it’s rich in low-calorie foods, so it’s easy enough to adjust if you’re looking to lose weight. “Weight loss may occur due to the elimination of ultra-processed foods, foods high in sugar, and refined grains, since these foods are void of fiber and make it hard to feel full,” says Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian for the Cleveland Clinic. A study published in the medical journal JAMA found that people who followed DASH and who exercised and limited alcohol intake lost a significant amount of weight. Worth noting: Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing high blood pressure. Your blood pressure rises as your body weight increases. Losing even 10 pounds can lower your blood pressure — and losing weight has the biggest effect on those who are overweight and have hypertension, according to a report from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health. Your Brain on DASH Research suggests the DASH diet may benefit more than your blood pressure — it could have brain health perks as well. A study of more than 5,100 women over a 30-plus-year follow-up period found that those who adhered to the DASH diet during middle age were 17 percent less likely to report symptoms of memory loss and cognitive decline later in life. The research was published in 2023 in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia. “Our data suggest that it is important to start a healthy diet in midlife to prevent cognitive impairment in older age,” Yixiao Song, a lead author of the study, said in a statement. “Following the DASH diet may not only prevent high blood pressure but also cognitive issues,” said Fen Wu, a senior associate research scientist and coleader of the study.

Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Women’s Health, Prevention, Health and Reader's Digest.","The article explores the effectiveness of the DASH diet in lowering blood pressure and its overall health benefits. The key findings suggest that the DASH diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, is effective in reducing blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, and may also reduce the risk of gout and cognitive decline. A novel insight is that adhering to the DASH diet in midlife may lower the risk of cognitive impairment in older age by 17%.",167

By Frank Lin AARP Comments En español Published October 10, 2022 Westend61 / Getty Images Adapted from AARP’s Hearing Loss for Dummies, www.aarp.org/hearingloss, by Frank Lin, MD, PhD, and Nicholas Reed, AuD. Over the past decade, research has shown that compared to those with normal hearing, people with hearing loss have a much higher risk of﻿ developing dementia. Increasingly, researchers are beginning to understand why. Here are three of the main theories that could explain the risk. 1. Hearing loss can lead to social isolation and loneliness. Hearing Loss for Dummies Authors Frank Lin and Nicholas Reed at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine lay out the steps to hearing health, including the benefits for your cognitive, emotional and physical well-being. When people with hearing loss begin to feel uncomfortable in social situations, they often cut themselves off, which can lead to loneliness, loss of engagement in cognitively stimulating activities, and depression — all of which can increase a person’s risk for dementia. 2. Hearing loss overloads the circuitry of the brain. With hearing loss, the brain is constantly having to work harder to process the degraded sounds coming from the ear. Scientists say that when this happens, the brain may have fewer resources (brain power!) to help preserve thinking and memory abilities. Hearing Loss for Dummies Authors Frank Lin and Nicholas Reed at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine lay out the steps to hearing health, including the benefits for your cognitive, emotional and physical well-being. 3. Hearing loss damages the brain. Hearing loss leads to the brain being less stimulated with sound information, and this in turn appears to be linked with parts of the brain shrinking and atrophying faster from this chronic deprivation. As you can probably guess, an atrophying brain is not a good thing! Scientists estimate that hearing loss may be the biggest potentially treatable risk factor for dementia, accounting for more cases of dementia in the world than other risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking or low education. Hearing aids to prevent dementia? At this point, you may be scratching your head and asking something along the lines of “Uh ... so are you telling me that people who have hearing loss are definitely going to get dementia?” The answer to this, of course, is “No.” Hearing loss may, however, increase your risk of dementia. Researchers can’t predict the exact increase of risk for a given person. The more important question, then, is whether strategies to address hearing loss such as hearing aids could actually help reduce someone’s risk for dementia. Scientists think this could be the case, but they don’t know yet for certain. There is an ongoing randomized controlled trial that we’re leading in the United States funded by the National Institutes of Health, where people are randomly assigned to either get their hearing loss treated or not. We should know the results in a few years, telling us whether hearing loss treatment is linked to a reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Cognition vs. Dementia Cognition refers to your thinking and memory abilities. There are different aspects to cognition, and these include such things as processing speed (for example, how quickly you can sort a deck of cards), memory, math-related skills and verbal language ability (for instance, being able to understand a complex written passage). As we age, it’s normal for our ability in some of these areas to decline, while others stay the same or even improve. We may never seem to remember where we placed our keys but have absolutely no problem reading a dense history book or medical journal. Dementia is definitely not normal and reflects when someone’s cognitive abilities have gotten to the point that the person can no longer independently do his or her typical daily activities, such as cooking meals and shopping. A lot of factors may contribute to dementia risk over time, and two of the most important causes of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular disease. Both of these conditions can damage the brain over time. In the meantime, the important thing to keep in mind is that addressing hearing loss with hearing aids and other strategies comes with virtually no health risks and could only have positive upsides for your ability to communicate and engage with others and possibly even benefits for your cognitive health. The degree to which these devices and strategies may reduce your risk for dementia remains to be determined, but there are clearly no downsides to addressing your hearing loss now.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/dementia-warning-signs/,"Complete Guide to Hands-on Caregiving View Series Brought to you by 15 Warning Signs of Dementia You Shouldn’t Ignore Symptoms can vary widely from person to person. Here are some telltale indicators By Rachel Nania, Updated April 29, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 20, 2024 / Updated April 29, 2025 Jon Krause You’re running late because you can’t find your keys. Of course, they’re buried in your bag. You walk into the living room to retrieve something important. What was it again? An acquaintance greets you in the grocery store. Her name escapes you. Moments of forgetfulness can happen at any age, and according to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), may happen even more as you age. Still, memory lapses can provoke anxiety for older adults who are often left wondering whether it’s all normal or a sign of something more serious. “It’s important for people not to be too upset at every little cognitive change,” says John Dickson, M.D., a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Still, research suggests many are. Results from a 2019 National Poll on Healthy Aging found that nearly half of respondents ages 50 to 64 are worried about developing dementia. Similarly, a 2021 survey from AARP found that nearly half of adults 40 and older think it’s likely they will get dementia. In reality, about 1 in 9 Americans 65 and older has dementia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While dementia is not inevitable, it is important to know the warning signs so that you or a loved one can get evaluated if there are concerns, Dickson says. Here’s what to look out for. What is dementia? Dementia is an umbrella term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life. It can diminish focus, attention, language skills, problem solving and visual perception. Dementia can also make it difficult for a person to control emotions and can even lead to personality changes. More than 55 million people worldwide have dementia, according to the World Health Organization. Video: 5 Signs of Dementia 15 warning signs of dementia 1. Short-term memory loss. It’s one thing to forget the name of the actor who starred in the movie you went to see with friends yesterday. It’s another to forget you went to see a movie with friends yesterday. “Those more significant lapses” — especially when it comes to recent events — are concerning, says Judith Heidebrink, M.D., a neurologist and clinical professor at University of Michigan Health. Short-term memory loss can be a common symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common type of dementia, Dickson says. “That’s because the short-term memory-forming center of the brain, called the hippocampus, is affected early in the disease process.” 2. Word loss. We’ve all experienced a time or two when your brain can’t find the right word, even though it’s on the tip-of-the-tongue. That can be normal, says Heather Whitson, M.D., a professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine and director of the Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development. But if it’s happening a lot and you find that a person is substituting in words that don’t fit the conversation, that’s worrying. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits For example, Whitson says, a person might want to ask, “Have you seen my jacket?” But when they can’t find the word for jacket, they ask, “Have you seen my shirt?” Another warning sign is difficulty joining, following or completing conversations. “Those types of communication skills can be an early symptom,” Heidebrink says. 3. Difficulty multitasking. If you’re someone who has always put out a Thanksgiving dinner without a hitch, and suddenly you find that staple side dishes are missing from the spread, the rolls are burned and dinner is delayed by two hours, that could signal something more serious is at play. “If it just doesn't seem like it's happening well, or it's happening with a lot more effort, that would be a sign that there are executive function issues,” Whitson says. What is dementia? Dementia is an umbrella term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life. It can diminish focus, attention, language skills, problem solving and visual perception. Dementia can also make it difficult for a person to control emotions and can even lead to personality changes. More than 55 million people worldwide have dementia, according to the World Health Organization. Video: 5 Signs of Dementia 4. Repetition. “If a person is being told by family or friends that they are repeating questions or repeating stories and statements in a short timeframe, without seeming to realize that they just told the person that, or they just asked that same question and it was answered, that's a red flag,” Whitson says. 5. Personality changes. A sudden and routine loss of interest in family, friends, work and social events can be a warning sign of dementia. “People may feel less comfortable in social situations — holding a conversation, remembering the conversation — so they may start to withdraw from social situations,” Heidebrink says. A 2023 study published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease found that apathy may be a sign that someone is progressing from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) — symptoms of memory loss or thinking problems that are not as severe as dementia — to Alzheimer’s disease. Acting increasingly anxious, confused, fearful or suspicious may also be a sign of dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. 6. New sleep behaviors. While Whitson says sleep issues can be “very common” among older adults, some sleep behaviors, such as sleepwalking, are not a normal part of aging. “It's important to know that there are some types of dementia that are associated with altered sleep behavior — acting out dreams or talking in your sleep, when that wasn't something that the person used to do,” Whitson says. 7. Worsening sense of direction. Changes in sense of direction can also occur with dementia, Dickson says, and this can manifest in things like difficulty driving and getting lost in familiar environments. “Sometimes it's just a loss of confidence,” Heidebrink adds. “People will start to restrict their driving to very familiar, close destinations, sort of low-speed, low-traffic situations, or good weather only.” 8. Depression. A new and sudden onset of depression later in life can be a warning sign of dementia, Dickson says. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, up to 40 percent of people with Alzheimer’s disease suffer from significant depression. Depression may not just be a symptom of dementia but also a potential precursor. A 2023 study published in JAMA Neurology found that dementia risk more than doubled for adults previously diagnosed with depression. 9. Confusion about time and place. If someone forgets where they are, or can’t remember how they got there, that’s a red flag. Another worrisome sign is disorientation about time — for example, routinely forgetting what day of the week it is, says Jason Karlawish, M.D., a neurologist and professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and codirector of the Penn Memory Center. 10. Difficulty with visual or perceptual tasks. Tripping over something because you don’t recognize that it’s in the way, or not being able to make sense of the time on a clock could be warning signs of dementia, Heidebrink says. Difficulty with balance, trouble reading and problems judging distance or distinguishing color and contrast can also be early indicators, the Alzheimer’s Association says. 11. Financial missteps. Money problems may be one of the first noticeable signs of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, according to the NIA. “There's a lot of reasoning and memory that go into financial tasks, and so [money management errors] can certainly be an early way that people experience changes,” Heidebrink says. According to the NIA, signs of money problems can include difficulties with the following: Counting changePaying for a purchaseCalculating a tipBalancing a checkbookUnderstanding a bank statement 12. Changes in judgment. People with dementia may experience changes in judgment and decision making that can affect everything from their appearance to their financial wellbeing, the Alzheimer’s Association says. A recent study led by researchers at the University of Southern California looked at brain images from 97 adults over the age of 50 and found that people who had brain changes associated with early stages of Alzheimer’s were more vulnerable to financial scams. While not a single, definitive indicator, “assessing financial vulnerability in older adults could help identify those who are in the early stages of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease,” researcher Duke Han said in a news release. 13. Misplacing things. We all lose our keys, reading glasses, that important piece of mail you meant to hold onto. But putting things in unusual places, or misplacing something and not being able to retrace your steps, can be an early warning sign of dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. It’s easy to lose track of things, especially when adjusting to a new routine, like retirement, Whitson says. What’s more concerning is if you find what you’re looking for, but have no recollection of putting it there in the first place. “If you’re frequently finding that you just have no memory of being in that room with that [missing object], to me, that is more alarming, because that suggests that something with short-term memory is not registering,” Whitson says. 14. Misusing items. Another subtle symptom “is not using things for their correct and intended purpose,” Whitson says. For example, eating with a spoon when you would usually select a fork, or pouring wine into a beer glass. 15. Hallucinations. Delusions or hallucinations can be a symptom of dementia — “particularly visual hallucinations, like seeing people or animals that aren't there,” Dickson says. Most common types of dementia These conditions are the leading causes of dementia. People can also have mixed dementia, a combination of two or more types, such as Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s is characterized by amyloid plaques and tangled fibers in the brain and by a loss of connections between nerve cells. Damage initially appears in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in memory formation, and gradually spreads. An estimated 7.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s disease, according to a 2025 report from the Alzheimer’s Association. By 2050, this number is expected to rise to 13 million, the same report states. Vascular dementia. The second most common type of dementia results from damage to the vessels that supply blood to the brain. It tends to affect focus, organization, problem-solving and speed of thinking more noticeably than memory. It’s estimated that 5 to 10 percent of people with dementia have vascular dementia. Lewy body dementia. Abnormal protein deposits in the brain, called Lewy bodies, interfere with brain chemistry and lead to problems with behavior, mood, movement and thinking. More than 1 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, according to federal statistics. Frontotemporal disorders. Degenerative damage to the brain’s frontal and temporal lobes is the most common cause of dementia in people age 65 and younger. Symptoms might include apathy; difficulty communicating, walking or working; emotional changes; and impulsive or inappropriate behaviors. According to UCSF Health, frontotemporal dementia affects an estimated 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 people. Additional sources: National Institute on Aging, Mayo Clinic What to do if you notice symptoms If you’ve noticed changes or have any concerns related to your thinking and memory, or that of a loved one, it’s important to call a doctor sooner than later, health experts say. 8 ailments that can mimic dementia Any number of treatable conditions can cause dementia-like symptoms. Some of the most common: Alcohol abuse Anxiety, depression or stress Blood clots, brain infections or tumors Delirium Head injuries Kidney, liver or thyroid problems Side effects of medication Vitamin deficiencies Hearing loss can also be mistaken for dementia, Whitson says. “Sometimes, if somebody is repeating a question, it might be because they didn't hear the answer before,"" she explains. Source: National Institute on Aging A big reason: “There are many possible causes of these changes,” Heidebrink says. “Not every case where someone is experiencing these changes is automatically Alzheimer's disease, for example. There could be other causes — a medication side effect, a metabolic hormone imbalance, something else that could be treatable.” If the changes are due to dementia, an early diagnosis has benefits. For example, there are newly approved medications that may slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, and research suggests the drugs work better in the beginning stages of the disease. Plus, an early diagnosis makes individuals eligible for a wider variety of clinical trials, the Alzheimer’s Association points out. You can start with your primary care provider, who may refer you to a specialist, like a neurologist or geriatric psychiatrist, for a more thorough evaluation and definitive diagnosis. How is dementia diagnosed? Some methods doctors use to help diagnose dementia: Cognitive and neurological tests assess language, math, memory, problem-solving and other types of mental functions.Blood tests, though relatively new and not yet widely available, can measure levels of beta-amyloid and p-tau217, hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.Brain scans such as MRI or PET imaging can spot changes in brain structure and function. These tests also can identify strokes, tumors and other problems that can cause dementia.Mental health evaluations can determine whether a mental health condition is causing or affecting the symptoms.Genetic tests may be helpful if symptoms appear before age 60. Early-onset Alzheimer’s is strongly linked to genetics, according to the Mayo Clinic. Talk with a genetic counselor before and after getting tested.

With pertussis on the rise, make sure you’re up to date with this vaccine By Barbara Stepko and Rachel Nania, Updated September 24, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 10, 2021 / Updated September 24, 2024 Getty Images Talk about an unwelcome comeback. Reports of whooping cough cases, which have been lower than usual these past few years, are creeping back up to pre-pandemic levels, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cases of the highly contagious infection, caused by Bordetella pertussis bacteria, are five times higher this year compared to the same time in 2023, preliminary data from the CDC shows. This year’s numbers (14,569 cases as of Sept. 14) are also higher than they were in September 2019, before the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Preventing whooping cough There is a way to prevent whopping cough, which can cause coughing fits so intense it becomes hard to breathe — and that’s with a vaccine. In the first year after vaccination, Tdap (for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) prevents the illness in about 7 of 10 people who receive the shot. The vaccine can also help keep you from passing on the virus to other people, including babies and young children, who are at highest risk for complications from an infection, says Gregory Poland, M.D., an infectious disease expert and director of the Mayo Clinic Vaccin﻿e Research Group. That’s why it is crucial for people who have close contact with children younger than 12 months — including parents, grandparents and childcare providers — to get a booster. Older adults can experience a bad case too, especially people who are frail or have underlying respiratory conditions. If you can’t remember ever getting this shot, you probably need it, since its protection wanes over time. A bonus: This can also count for one of the Td boosters you’re supposed to get every 10 years to prevent your diphtheria and tetanus immunizations (you know, the shot you need after stepping on a rusty nail during a home renovation or after getting a nasty nip from that rambunctious new puppy) from fading. Need another reason to roll up your sleeve? A 2021 study, published in The Journals of Gerontology, Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences, found that the Tdap vaccination is associated with a 42 percent lower dementia risk in older adults. However, the study authors noted: “Several vaccine types are linked to decreased dementia risk, suggesting that these associations are due to nonspecific effects on inflammation rather than vaccine-induced pathogen-specific protective effects.” What to know about the Tdap vaccine Who needs it: The Tdap vaccine is a triple whammy, protecting against tetanus and diphtheria as well as offering an additional defense against whooping cough. Can’t remember if you ever got the shot? Get it anyway. The three-in-one Tdap vaccine can count as one of the Td boosters you need to get every 10 years. Inform your doctor if you have epilepsy or other nervous system problems, had severe swelling or pain after a previous dose of either vaccine or have (or had) Guillain-Barré syndrome. How often: You get Tdap only once, and after that you still need a booster (either Tdap or Td) every 10 years. Otherwise, your protection against tetanus and diphtheria will fade. Why you need it: Whooping cough isn’t just a childhood disease. Due to a rise in cases in the U.S. — particularly among adults and adolescents — you need to be vaccinated, even if you’re over 65.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/dental-health-and-health/#comments_widget_id,"8 Surprising Things Your Teeth Can Tell You About Your Health Find out what potential dangers hide behind your smile By Barbara Sadick, AARP Comments En español Published July 22, 2022 recep-bg/Getty Images While we know that regular brushing, flossing and general dental care can prevent common problems such as cavities and gum disease, your teeth can also offer clues to brewing health problems. Discover what your pearly whites can reveal about your health. 1. Damaged tooth enamel can be a sign of eating disorders Although bulimia and anorexia are most common in girls and young women, recent studies show that about 13 percent of American women over the age of 50 have signs of eating disorders. Serious eating disorders can affect men as well. Bulimia, an illness characterized by a cycle of binge eating and self-induced vomiting, often leads to tooth damage. “Acid created in the stomach by vomiting erodes the inner enamel or thin outer coating of the teeth,” says Leila Jahangiri, clinical professor and chair of the ﻿Department of ﻿Prosthodontics at New York University College of Dentistry. The acid will cause damage to the back of the teeth but will usually spare the bottom front teeth. Jahangiri says the damage can be so extensive that the enamel is completely gone and teeth are thinner and can be seriously chipped. Anorexia, another serious illness, is characterized by weight loss, difficulty maintaining an appropriate body weight and distorted body image. Many people with bulimia are also anorexic, says Jahangiri, so those with anorexia may also have damage to their tooth enamel. 2. Pale gums can be a sign of anemia Anemia is a condition that develops when not enough rich, healthy red blood cells are produced in the body. The low level of red blood cells makes a person with anemia feel weak and tired. It can also cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches and an irregular heartbeat. Postmenopausal women are at higher risk of anemia than men due to iron loss. In the United States, approximately 10 percent of the 35 million people over 65 are considered anemic. Domenica Sweier, clinical professor at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, says that along with many other medical conditions, anemia can cause the gum tissue to be a very pale pinkish-white. “A dentist might look at the gum color, ask additional questions and would likely refer a patient to a medical doctor,” Sweier says. It’s important to note, however, that anemia can’t be diagnosed from gum color, but rather should be diagnosed with blood tests. 3. Osteoporosis can put people at risk for tooth loss Osteoporosis is a bone disease that develops when bone density, mass and structure in the body changes. It can lead to loss of bone strength and risk of bone fractures. Both men and women get the disease, but﻿ it’s more common in women as a result of hormonal changes that cause weakening of the bone, which can cause fractures and other skeletal problems. Fifty-four million Americans have osteoporosis and low bone mass. Half are over the age of 50. Osteoporosis is often called a “silent disease” because many don’t know they have it until bones in the body begin to break. Erinne Kennedy, director for predoctoral dental education at Kansas City University College of Dental Medicine, says that along with age, genetics, hormonal changes and smoking, osteoporosis can be a risk factor for tooth loss. Mary Grace Ash, clinical lecturer at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry and course director of gerontology for dental hygienists, says, “There are lots of bones around a tooth﻿, and indications of osteoporosis include tooth recession, mobility and increase in pockets between teeth,” she says. “And a dentist should be able to spot it.” Tooth loss, however, is not always a sign of osteoporosis. Many other conditions can cause the loss of teeth as people age. 4. Complications of kidney disease can lead to tooth loss The kidneys are bean-shaped, fist-sized organs that filter extra water and waste out of the blood and make urine. When the blood can’t be filtered properly, the result is kidney disease. Symptoms include dryness of the mouth, changes in taste and malnutrition. People who have kidney disease often have compromised immune systems and chronic inflammation. A compromised immune system is susceptible to the overgrowth of bacteria or fungus in the body, which can lead to periodontal disease, Sweier says. Periodontal or gum disease is a common bacteria-induced inflammatory disease that causes bleeding gums, wobbly teeth and tooth loss. Some research shows that those with inflammation of the gums have more compromised kidney function. Additionally, recent studies show that inflamed gums provide an opportunity for bacteria to enter the bloodstream. 5. Oral thrush can be a sign of HIV Oral thrush is a fungal infection caused by a fungus called candida, which is normally present in low numbers in the mouths of many people. The problem arises when there’s an overgrowth of candida. This can be caused by several factors, including a compromised immune system. “When present, oral thrush may cause burning and soreness in the mouth and throat, making it difficult to eat,” says Ash. Because people with HIV/AIDS have compromised immune systems, oral thrush is sometimes a sign of the disease. The National Center for Biotechnology Information estimates that around 80 to 90 percent of people with HIV will have oral thrush. If people with HIV/AIDS practice good oral hygiene and have their mouths checked regularly, symptoms can be discovered and treated early. 6. Acid reflux can cause damage to tooth enamel Acid reflux occurs when the contents of your stomach or stomach acid regurgitates into the esophagus. Symptoms can run from nonexistent to mild to heartburn﻿, or what’s known as acid indigestion, which tends to be more common as people age. About 20 percent of Americans suffer from acid reflux. A dentist should be able to detect tooth damage by erosion from acid reflux right away. Jahangari says the damage from acid will appear on the back of the upper and some of the bottom teeth. “You may feel little holes or notches on your back molars, but generally the tongue protects the bottom front teeth,” she adds. The erosion of tooth enamel caused by acid reflux can cause sensitivity to hot, cold or sweet foods and drink, chipped teeth or sharp tooth edges, discoloration or darkening of the teeth, and thinning and shortening teeth, which can cause changes in your bite or pain and irritation in your mouth. 7. Poor dental hygiene is linked to cognitive decline Poor oral hygiene can be a sign of cognitive decline, especially in those who have previously taken good care of their teeth. As brushing, flossing and dental visits become more difficult, the ability to maintain the health of the teeth lessens, says Ash. Research has also linked tooth loss to a higher risk of dementia. Ash says when an older person who has previously taken good care of his or her teeth has food debris in the mouth, the lack of self-care could indicate decline. Caregiver support may be needed. 8. Teeth grinding can be a sign of sleep apnea Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes breathing to stop or become very shallow during sleep. Pauses in breathing may last from a few seconds to minutes and may happen 30 times or more during an hour. The National Sleep Foundation has found that 1 in 4 people with sleep apnea also grind their teeth at night. Symptoms include snoring, teeth grinding and gasping. Untreated sleep apnea is linked to serious health problems including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, liver problems and possibly even dementia. “It’s amazing what we can learn from studying teeth,” Kennedy says, “and what we learn just may save your life.” Based in New York, Barbara Sadick is a freelance health journalist. Her work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, U.S. News & World Report and The Washington Post, among other publications.","The article explores the connection between oral health and overall well-being, revealing that teeth can indicate underlying health issues. Key findings include links between tooth damage and eating disorders, pale gums and anemia, and teeth grinding and sleep apnea, among others. A surprising insight is that poor dental hygiene can be an early sign of cognitive decline, highlighting the importance of monitoring oral health in older adults. The article emphasizes the role of dentists in detecting these potential health problems.",171

Some say new criteria could spark worry before life-saving therapies are available By Esther Landhuis, AARP Reviewed by Jason Karlawish, M.D. Comments En español Published March 05, 2025 Getty Images Would you want to know you have Alzheimer’s disease years before symptoms of memory loss and confusion set in? An expert committee says that’s now possible. According to their new criteria, published last June, a doctor can diagnose the disease purely from the results of a brain scan, a spinal tap or a simple blood test. Like cancer, diabetes and other illnesses that are routinely detected by biological markers in people with no symptoms, Alzheimer’s can be traced to an abnormal buildup of two proteins — amyloid and tau — well in advance of any changes in memory, personality or behavior that might emerge years later. But just because it’s possible to detect those markers of Alzheimer’s, does it make sense to do so? And what does this label mean for a person who may or may not ever experience symptoms at a time when few treatment options exist? Earlier diagnosis doesn’t guarantee better outcomes First, some context: The new diagnostic criteria are not surprising. They come on the heels of two milestones — the availability of new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration as disease-slowing treatments, and research showing that new blood tests are reliable, which expands the options for diagnosing the disease. Blood tests are much cheaper and easier to administer than brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and can detect disease biology about as well. In fact, blood tests can identify people with early-stage Alzheimer’s more accurately than standard evaluations by primary care physicians and even dementia specialists. A leading blood test measures both Alzheimer’s biomarkers — a modified form of the protein tau, called p-tau217, and several versions of amyloid (amyloid-β 42 and amyloid-β 40). Amyloid accumulates very early in the disease; p-tau217 shows up later, at a stage of disease when neurons are dying. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits So the question of whether doctors can diagnose Alzheimer’s just from biological markers is “an undisputed yes,” says Andrew Budson, M.D., professor of neurology at Boston University and director of the Center for Translational Cognitive Neuroscience at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System. “You can, in the same way that you can diagnose cancer with a mammogram or colonoscopy.” But can does not mean should. To be clear, even the authors of the new diagnostic criteria, the Alzheimer’s Association Workgroup, say they don’t recommend blood tests for people who show no signs of cognitive impairment, although that nuance is somewhat buried in the report. That’s in large part because the medications that reduce levels of amyloid in the brain — Leqembi (lecanemab) and Kisunla (donanemab) — have only shown benefits in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild-stage dementia, and their potential side effects can be serious. To date, “we have zero evidence … that treating people with just amyloid in their brain leads to any positive outcome,” says Eric Widera, M.D., professor of medicine and clinician-educator in geriatric medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Those studies, called AHEAD and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, described below, are happening now. Widera is a member of the International Working Group, or IWG, researchers from 17 countries who published a 2024 paper in JAMA Neurology cautioning against diagnosing people with Alzheimer’s disease based solely on biology without signs of dementia. The IWG and others warn that the availability of blood tests can cause undue worry for people who test positive without getting appropriate counseling on how to interpret the results. “They’ll be confused because they’ll know they don’t have Alzheimer’s dementia … but they’ll start to notice every problem with their memory,” says Deborah Blacker, M.D., geriatric psychiatrist and epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. In reality, not every memory blip is cause for concern; some are due to inattentiveness (you lost your keys because you were distracted when you walked in the door), or lack of sleep or even certain medications. Importantly, most people with amyloid in their brain make it through life free of dementia. Having tau in the brain increases risk, but not to 100 percent. In a 2018 computer modeling study that estimated probabilities of disease progression based on amyloid status and other factors such as age and national death rates, fewer than 1 in 4 cognitively normal 75-year-old women who test positive for amyloid go on to develop Alzheimer’s dementia during their lifetime. For men at the same age, that figure is 1 in 5. It’s been known for decades that many who die with normal cognition have “a head full of amyloid,” Blacker says. For a 75-year-old woman with both amyloid and tau in her brain, the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s dementia is closer to 1 in 3. “There’s a lot that needs to go wrong for something as important as cognition to fail,” adds Fanny Elahi, M.D., a neurologist-scientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “We actually are very resilient.” Test results may cause unnecessary alarm When people hear “Alzheimer’s disease,” most imagine the dreadful condition that robs a person’s memory and thinking skills — not an abnormal test result. A blood test measures biology, Elahi says. “It doesn’t equate to dementia. It doesn’t mean [those testing positive] are ‘doomed.’ ” Still, the psychological impact of biomarker tests on people with no apparent impairment is murky. Some worry that disclosing test results may invite possible discrimination in employment, housing and insurance. But since “we know there is biology that contributes to Alzheimer’s-related dementia,” she adds, a test tells someone they are at higher risk for dementia. What the test cannot measure is when someone might develop a life-altering disease — or whether they will at all. While a positive test doesn’t signify Alzheimer’s-related dementia, “a negative test doesn’t mean you won’t develop a different neurodegenerative disorder,” Daniel Press, a cognitive neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote in an email. “I guess my main advice would be to talk it through with an expert before getting [a test].” Some scientists liken the Alzheimer’s blood test to a PSA test, which detects a protein whose high levels could signal prostate cancer, yet often isn’t cause for alarm. Since many prostate tumors grow slowly, “more people die with prostate cancer than from it,” Blacker says. Similarly, Elahi perceives the buildup of amyloid — as well as tau — as a lifelong continuum. “Everyone who lives is on that continuum,” she says. The big unknown is how long it will take these proteins to reach a tipping point and trigger dementia. For one person it could happen when they’re 50 years old, for another at age 90, and for another never, Elahi says. A major benefit of identifying people at early stages of disease is that this is when they’re most likely to respond to treatments being tested in clinical research studies — and while there’s still time to make lifestyle changes. There is accumulating research suggesting that everyday actions — such as ongoing exercise, healthy eating and managing stress — can reduce a person’s risk of dementia. If a test result will move a person to change their lifestyle, there’s benefit, Elahi says. But if it causes someone to become depressed and lose hope, that’s not helpful. The psychological impacts are important. As is how the test results are used. “This, I think, is true for every diagnostic test that has ever become available. Interpretation … and communication of what that result means is everything,” she says. The AHEAD study aims to address the question of whether the disease-slowing drug Leqembi might work for people with no symptoms. The National Institutes of Health and Eisai, one of the drug’s developers, are funding the research. Enrollment closed in September 2024, with more than 1,600 people ages 55 to 80, who are amyloid-positive but show no signs of cognitive decline, randomly assigned to receive infusions of either Leqembi or a placebo once every two to four weeks for four years. Results are expected by late 2028 or early 2029. A similar study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, is testing Kisunla in people with “preclinical Alzheimer’s,” described as no cognitive decline but signs of amyloid and tau in their brain. ​Esther Landhuis is a science and health journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area who formerly covered Alzheimer’s and other degenerative diseases for Alzforum.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/decongestant-hypertension-side-effects/,"High Blood Pressure? What You Need to Know About Cold and Flu Medicines Decongestants commonly found in these pills and liquids can be risky for the heart By Rachel Nania, Updated May 31, 2024 AARP By Zachary Cox, PharmD Comments En español Published February 14, 2020 / Updated May 31, 2024 Getty Images ​Headed to the pharmacy for something to relieve your aching, sneezing, stuffed-up symptoms? If you’re among the 70 percent of adults 65 and older with high blood pressure, also called hypertension, you may want to think twice before grabbing one of the many over-the-counter options. That’s because decongestants, a common ingredient in cold and flu medications, can raise your blood pressure, according to the latest guidelines published in 2017 by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. “It’s kind of a general thing that [decongestants] are not a good idea for people with high blood pressure,” says Sandra J. Taler, M.D., a professor of medicine and physician in the division of nephrology and hypertension at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “And probably a lot of people don’t know that.” Similarly, some pain relievers that people take to treat a cold or the flu come with risks for people with high blood pressure. How do decongestants raise blood pressure? Decongestants stimulate the muscles in the artery walls, causing them to constrict or narrow, explains Matthew F. Muldoon, M.D., the founding director of the Hypertension Center at the UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute and a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This constriction of blood vessels in the nose relieves swelling in the nose and keeps fluid from getting into the sinuses, which is helpful if you are congested. But it also “causes the pressure inside the arteries [throughout your body] to increase a little bit,” Muldoon says. The effect that decongestants have on blood pressure is especially a concern for people who have heart disease and whose high blood pressure is not well controlled, Muldoon says. If you have high blood pressure or heart disease, “the last thing you need is constricting blood vessels,” Erin Michos, M.D., associate director of preventive cardiology at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Baltimore, said in a statement with the American Heart Association. “It can exacerbate or worsen the condition.” Cold and flu medications to avoid if you have high blood pressure It’s not always obvious what pills and liquids on the drugstore shelves contain decongestants. There are a handful of decongestant-only products, but most often decongestants are included in combination products that target a range of symptoms, congestion being just one of them. Multisymptom products that contain decongestants include Tylenol Cold and Flu, Advil Multi-Symptom Cold and Flu, Benadryl Allergy Plus Congestion, Mucinex Sinus Max — and the list goes on. How can you tell if a decongestant is in your cold and flu medicine? Taler says to look at the ingredient list for pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine.

How can you tell if a decongestant is in your cold and flu medicine? Taler says to look at the ingredient list for pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine. Pseudoephedrine: What to know You can buy the over-the-counter decongestant pseudoephedrine alone or in combination products. Sold as either a liquid or tablet, pseudoephedrine relieves congestion by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages. One thing to note: Even though it’s sold over the counter, you’ll need to show an ID at the pharmacy counter to purchase any medications containing pseudoephedrine, since it can also be used illegally to produce methamphetamine. Phenylephrine: What to know Like pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine constricts the blood vessels in the nasal passages. However, because of the way the decongestant is metabolized when taken orally, studies have found that it doesn’t work as well as pseudoephedrine. In fact, a 2023 Food and Drug Administration advisory panel concluded that when taken orally, phenylephrine is not effective at relieving congestion. However, it’s not harmful, so it remains on the market until the agency decides to remove it. A few other things to keep in mind when shopping for medicines The letters “CF” or “D” on the box or bottle are another signal that a decongestant is present, Taler adds. People with high blood pressure should also be cautious of cold medicine combinations containing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs); Advil Cold and Sinus is one example. Like decongestants, NSAIDs can raise your blood pressure and counteract the effectiveness of high blood pressure medications, Taler explains. Safer flu and cold medicines for high blood pressure So what can you turn to? Decongestant nasal sprays may seem like a safer option, but Muldoon cautions that these can cause rebound congestion, or nasal congestion that won’t go away. Taler points to guaifenesin (Mucinex) as an option if you need to thin and clear mucus. And dextromethorphan (Robitussin) can be used to suppress coughs. Even with these, be sure to avoid the “CF” and “D” varieties. Some drug manufacturers also make cold medicines specifically for people with high blood pressure; these are usually marked with “HBP” on the package. Examples include the Coricidin HBP line and DayQuil High Blood Pressure Cold and Flu. Muldoon suggests talking to a pharmacist before venturing down the cold and flu aisle. Tell them your symptoms and let them know if you have high blood pressure and are taking any other medications. They’ll be able to help you select something safe for the heart that’s helpful for your stuffy nose or headache. Your doctor can also guide you. Blood pressure guidelines suggest using decongestants for the shortest duration possible (no more than seven days) or using an alternative such as nasal saline spray or allergy medications (antihistamines) to help with congestion. The guidelines say people with severe or uncontrolled hypertension should avoid decongestants completely. Alternative remedies to OTC decongestants if you have high blood pressure Nondrug options can ease cold and flu symptoms. For example, steamy showers, humidifiers and nasal saline sprays (mentioned above) can help relieve congestion. A hot beverage can aid with a sore throat, research suggests, and plenty of solid research shows that honey can help your cough, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Finally, make sure you drink plenty of fluids to help loosen congestion and prevent dehydration.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/factors-weight-loss-harder-after-50/,"Losing Weight After 50: Top 20 Expert Tips Tactics for mastering your metabolism and shaving off those extra pounds By Kimberly Goad, Updated August 24, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published June 15, 2021 / Updated August 24, 2023 Getty Images It’s not your imagination. Losing weight after age 50 really is more challenging. But that doesn't mean you have to accept weight gain as an inevitable part of the aging process. ​​ Why is it harder to lose weight after 50?​ A number of lifestyle and physiological factors conspire to make dropping a few pounds more onerous than it was at 35 or 40 (not that it was easy then). The culprits include arthritis and other conditions that can affect stamina, mobility and balance; sleep and stress issues; dwindling muscle mass; and declining levels of the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. ​ The hormones that regulate appetite and satiety — such as ghrelin from the gut and leptin from fat cells — also have their way with us in middle age, making it even more challenging to stay true to a healthy eating plan. ​ That’s not to say everyone is destined to battle the bulge. “Not all people over 50 will experience the same degree of difficulty with weight loss as genes determine 40 to 70 percent of what your weight is at a given time,” says Holly Lofton, M.D., director of the NYU Langone Medical Weight Management Program in New York City.​​ Read on for 20 expert tips on how to lose weight after 50. 1. Embrace strength training By age 50, you’ve lost about 10 percent of your muscle mass, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. It’s not just a cosmetic concern: Dwindling muscle mass impacts the way you burn calories. “Muscle is more metabolically active — it burns more calories than fat,” explains William Yancy Jr., M.D., director of the Duke Lifestyle and Weight Management Center in Durham, North Carolina. “So having a higher ratio of muscle to fat will mean you burn more energy — just while sitting. To build that muscle, you have to exercise, and that burns calories, too.”​ All exercise is good, of course, but strength training — such as lifting weights — is the secret to building muscle. That goes for both men and women. A review of studies published in 2021 in Sports Medicine shows that ﻿strength training (sometimes called resistance training or weight training) isn’t just a guy thing: Women 50 and older reap just as many benefits. Aim for two to three weight training sessions a week.​​ 2. Remember the 200-calorie rule The number of calories you need each day drops slightly as you age, but most people keep eating the same amount of food. The government's dietary guidelines advise that you burn approximately 200 fewer daily calories after age 50. The best way to make that happen? Combine calorie cutting (to get into the habit, try using a calorie-counting app like MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, or MyNetDiary) and strength training.​​ A landmark study published in 2017 in the journal Obesity enlisted 249 people 60 and older to compare the effectiveness of diet and exercise on their fat and muscle composition. The participants were divided into three groups. One group was asked to cut about 300 calories a day from their diets. Another group cut calories and also did about 45 minutes of aerobic exercise four times a week. The third group combined calorie-cutting with strength training. After 18 months, those who combined diet and exercise lost the most weight (20 pounds on average). But the strength-training group lost more fat (18 pounds) and less muscle (only 2 pounds) than the aerobic group.​ 3. Stay hydrated​ Drinking plenty of fluids is important for overall health—adults who aren’t well hydrated may age faster and face a higher risk of chronic diseases than their well-hydrated counterparts — and it plays an equally important role in maintaining a healthy weight.​ When you drink water, your body goes through a process known as thermogenesis to bring the liquid to body temperature. Since that process requires energy, you essentially burn calories and get a metabolism boost just by drinking H20. Fluid intake is also important to the complex cycle of converting protein and carbohydrates into usable energy, Lofton notes. Aim for eight glasses of water a day, and try to eat more foods with high water content (like fruits and vegetables). ​ 4. Break a sweat Although strength-building activities help preserve muscle that keeps your metabolism revving, cardio exercise is important, too, says Yancy, who suggests a combination of the two. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio—such as brisk walking—per week.​ 5. Curb your sweet tooth​ Cutting back on sweets seems so obvious, it’s hardly worth mentioning. But there’s more at play than just empty calories. ​ With age, declining levels of estrogen and testosterone set the body up for storing fat in just the spot—your abdomen—that makes dropping pounds more challenging. Excess sugar, already a leading cause of belly fat, only exacerbates things by spiking insulin levels. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance, which furthers weight gain and makes weight loss difficult, Yancy says.​ 6. Avoid late-night snacking Not only does eating late increase hunger and alter appetite-regulating hormones, it also reduces the number of calories burned throughout the day, as compared with early eating, found a study in Cell Metabolism. As if that weren’t enough, late-night eaters are also more apt to store fat in their abdomen. ​ 7. Check what medication you’re taking Some drugs — most notably for conditions that are exacerbated by excess weight, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes — can cause weight gain. A study published in Obesity found that more than 20 percent of adults in the United States take at least one medication that causes weight gain, the most common being some beta-blockers and diabetes drugs such as insulin and sulfonylureas. “Medications such as hormones, steroids and some antidepressants can also cause weight gain,” Lofton says. “The longer you take these types of meds, the more the body can store larger, more stubborn fat cells.”​ If weight loss is challenging and you’re taking any of the above medications, “seek medical attention specifically to address your individual weight management options,” Lofton suggests. There may be alternative meds that don’t cause weight gain. ﻿​​ 8. Get plenty of sleep Research consistently shows a link between sleep deprivation and weight gain. One study in BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine found that sleep-deprived participants not only ate more the next day, but they also reached for high-calorie fare. A lack of sleep may affect the body’s regulation of the hormones ghrelin (boosts appetite) and leptin (inhibits hunger), too. ​ Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, because big swings in your sleep schedule can affect your metabolism. If you struggle to make that happen, creating a bedtime ritual to signal the body and mind to slow down may help. This could include turning off all devices, changing into pajamas and brushing your teeth at least an hour before sleep.​​ 9. Weigh yourself regularly ​Every morning or every week, it’s up to you. Just make sure you step on the scale at the same time of day for each weigh-in so you can get a more accurate picture of how your weight loss efforts are paying off. A two-year study found that frequent weigh-ins and tracking results on a chart were effective for both losing weight and keeping it off, especially for men. ​ ​ 10. Set S.M.A.R.T. weight loss goals Research shows you’ll up your odds of losing weight if you set goals that are:​ Specific: Instead of more fruits and vegetables, you’ll eat five servings of fruit and vegetables every day.​ Measurable: You’ll log 10,000 steps per day on your activity tracker.​ Attainable: Rather than promising yourself you’ll go to the gym every day, start with three days a week. ​ Realistic: You’ll curb your soda habit by choosing sparkling water on four out of five occasions. ​​ Time-bound: Mark the start date of your new eating plan on your calendar.​​ 11. Set a S.M.A.R.T. goal to swear off ultraprocessed foods Cured meats, baked goods, pretty much everything you find on the snack aisle—these are all out to sabotage your weight loss efforts. In a small study, participants were put on a diet of unprocessed foods (fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains) or ultra-processed foods. Participants were presented with the same amounts of overall calories, protein, and carbohydrates, and were allowed to eat as much as they wanted. After fourteen days, the dieters switched to the opposite plan. ​ The participants ate 500 calories a day more, on average, when they ate ultraprocessed fare than when they were given whole foods, and—no surprise—they gained, rather than lost weight. ​​ 12. Excuse-proof your exercise routine Pick a gym close to home, enlist an exercise buddy, hire a personal trainer, schedule workouts as you would any must-keep appointment. On the days you’d rather do anything but work out, any—or all—of these will help keep you accountable. ​ 13. Put your eating plan on autopilot Advance meal prep is one of the easiest ways to stick to any eating plan. Set aside a few hours over the weekend to prep what you need for the week ahead: quinoa or brown rice, beans or lentils, roasted vegetables, grilled chicken breasts—these can all be cooked in advance, stored in the fridge and reheated on the fly. ​ ​14﻿. Try HIIT​ All cardio — including walking, cycling and jogging — counts, but alternating between low-intensity and high-intensity moves has been shown to provide a greater boost to your metabolism than moderate-intensity exercise alone. If you work in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in the morning, research shows, you may get the most effective metabolism boost for the rest of your day. ​​ 15. Eat more whole grains​ Whole grains such as oats, quinoa, and brown rice contain all the parts of the kernel—even the tougher, harder-to-digest bits—so your body uses more energy to break them down. When study participants ages 40 to 65 consumed the same number of calories, but swapped refined white flour and rice for whole grains, they burned nearly 100 extra calories per day. ​ 16. Get plenty of protein​ It isn’t just lack of physical activity that leads to a loss in muscle mass; inadequate protein intake also figures in. Seek out high-quality protein sources such as eggs and low-fat meats, as well as possible high-quality nutritional supplements, suggests Lofton. A study published in 2020 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a diet higher in protein was associated with less loss of muscle mass over three years in women ages 70 to 79, particularly Black women. Another study suggests that eating equal amounts of protein at all three meals boosts muscle strength and, by extension, metabolism in adults over 67. ​ 17. Sit less Whether it’s because of stiff joints, low energy, or lack of time, we become less active as we get older, research suggests. A study published in 2019 in the Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy suggests that older adults spend 60 to 80 percent of their waking hours sedentary. No surprise: that impacts weight loss. ​ What is surprising: It isn’t just the major sweat sessions that burn calories. In a study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers looked at the effect of walking speed on weight loss in previously sedentary postmenopausal women. Their findings suggest that although total body fat is lost at all speeds, the change is initially greater in slow walkers (defined by the researchers as about 3.5 miles per hour) who are overweight. Not sure how physically active you are over the course of the day? Wear an accelerometer to track your steps and intensity of daily activity, Lofton suggests.﻿​ 18. Eat until you’re satisfied Many of us wonder, “Should you eat until you are full?” The answer is, “Mind your hara hachi bu point.” In Japanese, this means to eat until you’re 80% full. Your aim should be to feel satisfied and not hungry anymore, rather than full, the Cleveland Clinic recommends. ​ 19. Keep your metabolism humming Conventional wisdom has long held that metabolism slows with age, but research challenges that assumption. According to a study published in 2021 in the journal Science, metabolism actually holds steady from ages 20 to 60 — so long as your muscle mass doesn’t change — then declines by about 0.7 percent a year after 60. Though seemingly insignificant, that less-than-a-percentage-point-per-year slowdown can add up over the years and have an impact, Yancy says. ​Your resting metabolic rate — meaning the number of calories your body burns when you’re doing nothing — can decrease if your muscle mass decreases as you age, Lofton says. If we don’t adjust our eating and exercise habits to accommodate that metabolic change, the weight can creep up over the years.​ 20. Rethink happy hour​ It isn’t just the calories in that glass of wine that add up over time; research shows that booze can do a number on all your good intentions. One study suggests that alcohol can trigger hunger signals in the brain, leading to an increased urge to eat more.​ ​​ Editor's Note: This article, originally published June 15, 2021, has been updated to reflect new information. ﻿ Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

But can older adults get this surgery, or do people age out of the option? “We never think of a hard, fast rule or cut off age-wise; the decision of who should have a type of elective refractive surgery is considered to be truly patient-specific, as long as they don't have any outstanding health conditions with their eyes,” says Michelle E. Andreoli, M.D., a clinical assistant professor of ophthalmology at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Although there’s no definitive age cut-off for LASIK, you must be at least 18 years old to have the procedure. To perform this type of refractive surgery, doctors use an ultraviolet laser to reshape the curvature of the cornea, the clear covering of the eye that refracts light. More effective for younger eyes Research scientists in Germany studied two groups of people who got LASIK surgery. One group included 341 people aged 55 and older, and the second group included 341 people between the ages of 30 and 40. They found that the safety for both groups was very similar, but it was not equally effective. After the surgery, the people in the older group had more nearsightedness, also called myopia, and worse clarity of vision, according to a 2024 article published in the journal Scientific Reports. The researchers found no difference in the effectiveness and safety of farsighted people. People tend to have more problems with their eyes as they age. So other eye conditions can certainly limit the success of the surgery, says Wuqaas M. Munir, M.D., associate professor of ophthalmology at the University of Maryland Medical System. Who should skip LASIK? Lasik is not for everyone. If you have one of these conditions, you might need to hang on to your glasses, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Many of these conditions become more common with age, making older eyes less likely to be good candidates for the surgery. 1. Certain autoimmune diseases These can include conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. People with arthritis can develop eye issues from inflammation. Lupus is associated with vision changes. Also, the medications used to treat some autoimmune disorders hamper the immune system, making healing a challenge. 2. Blepharitis This inflammation of the eyelids causes crusting of the eyelashes that increases risk of infection, so people with this condition aren’t good candidates for LASIK surgery, 3. Cataracts This condition causes clouding of the eye. You should wait to have LASIK until after you’ve had cataract surgery. 4. Diabetes This metabolic disease can also affect your sight. Although some people with well-controlled diabetes may be candidates, they may have a longer healing period. 5. Immunodeficiency conditions like HIV People with these conditions may not heal properly after surgery due to the conditions themselves or medications like steroids, which can slow healing. 6. Glaucoma This is a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve. Those with uncontrolled glaucoma are not a good candidates for LASIK. 7. Large pupils Depending on the size of your pupils, LASIK may not be recommended. 8. Migraines If you take sumatriptan (Imitrex) for migraines, you might be at risk for drug-induced conjunctivitis (pink eye). 9. Thin corneas Instead of LASIK, those with thin corneas might do better with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). In this procedure, the epithelium, the top surface of the eye, is removed rather than forming a flap, as is done with LASIK. 10. Dry eyes This condition, where your eyes don’t make enough tears, is common in people over 50. LASIK can make it worse. You would want to check with your doctor to see if you have any of these conditions or others that would make you less eligible, such as problems with your immune system. “They don't necessarily mean that you can't have the surgery, but there are risk factors for healing,” Munir says. Questions to ask before choosing a surgeon Ask your eye doctor to help you find a reliable surgeon. You will want to find someone who does the operation frequently, so it’s a good idea to ask how many years the surgeon has been performing the procedure. You can also ask what kind of laser they use to see if it’s the latest FDA-approved technology. The newest technology was released in 2018 and is called iDESIGN Refractive Studio, STAR Excimer Laser System. What to expect If you’re feeling nervous, the doctor can prescribe a sedative to take before the procedure, and you should have someone drive you to and from the surgery center. The doctor will seat you in a reclining chair, numb your eye, and use an instrument to hold your eye open during the half-hour surgery. The doctor will create a flap on the cornea using a laser to reshape it, thus correcting your vision. Many people have 20/20 vision or better after surgery. Once you are ready to go home, your doctor will give you goggles to wear while you sleep to protect your eyes from scratches. After the surgery, keep your hands away from your eyes. You shouldn’t shower until the next day. The American Academy of Ophthalmology warns that some people might have discomfort following the procedure that diminishes over time. This can include: Blurry visionDouble visionDry eyesEye painHalosLight sensitivityScratchiness Andreoli says typically the halos and dry eye side effects are worse for people over 50. You'll visit your eye doctor a day or two after the procedure to check your eyesight and assess the healing process. You may need touch-ups later People who get LASIK can enjoy better vision for a long time, but not forever, because laser surgery doesn’t prevent the eye from changing or aging, according to the Refractive Surgery Council. Some people need reading glasses several years after LASIK surgery. “The average LASIK patient in the United States can go about 10 to 15 years before they are slipping and starting to need distance glasses,” Andreoli says. One option is to get a touch-up. She cautions there may be some trade-offs to getting an enhancement. She adds that a touch-up may sharpen your eyesight for distance but may worsen your close-up sight. Cost considerations LASIK surgery can cost between $1,000 to $ 4,000, and insurance may not cover much, if any of the cost, because it is considered an elective surgery. If you’re still working and have a Flexible Spending Account or a Health Savings Account, you can use funds from those accounts for the surgery. Medicare considers this surgery elective and does not cover the cost but some Medicare Advantage might. You’d have to check with your provider about your case. Although insurance will not likely cover any of the cost, the surgery center may offer a warranty, which is worth asking about. Be wary of low-cost deals that seem too good to be true. In 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) refunded $1.1 million to consumers tricked by bait-and-switch advertising by LCA-vision. Advertisements for $300 procedures were actually priced between $1,000 and $2,295 per eye for the surgery. Patients were given the true cost estimate following an eye exam during an in-person consultation. When deciding whether LASIK is right for you, consider your overall health, cost, and long-term expectations. Lauren Evoy Davis is a contributing writer who has covered health and wellness for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in the National Council on Aging, Everyday Health, HealthCentral, Patient Power, WebMD and Verywell Health.","The article explores whether there is an age limit for LASIK surgery, a popular elective eye surgery. Key findings indicate that while there is no strict age cut-off, LASIK is more effective for younger eyes, and older adults may experience more nearsightedness and worse clarity of vision after the surgery. Notably, certain health conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, cataracts, and dry eyes, can disqualify individuals from undergoing LASIK, and older adults are more likely to have these conditions.",175
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/heart-health-benefits-of-weight-loss/,"Losing Weight May Benefit Your Heart — Even if You Gain Some Back A new study suggests the health benefits of modest weight loss can last several years fcafotodigital / getty images By Rachel Nania, AARP En español Published March 29, 2023 It doesn’t take much: Losing even a modest amount of weight — we’re talking about 5 to 10 percent of your total body weight, if you have excess weight to lose — can come with some big health benefits. And new research suggests these benefits may last several years, even if some of the weight creeps back on. A study published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes examined the results of 124 clinical trials totaling more than 50,000 participants. The researchers found that those who lost weight through what’s known as intensive behavioral weight loss programs — these often incorporate diet and exercise, paired with professional or peer support — had lower risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes than people who participated in less-intensive programs or no program at all. What’s more, these improved markers lasted at least five years, even if some weight was regained. The weight loss, heart health connection The impact of these findings, nutrition scientist Chris Gardner explains, is far-reaching. “We have one of the most overweight countries in the world, and our health care system is getting crippled by this and it’s really affecting the quality of our lives in years to come,” says Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chair of the American Heart Association’s Nutrition Committee. In the U.S., roughly 2 out of 3 adults are overweight or have obesity, both of which are risk factors for many serious health conditions, including heart disease and stroke — two of the country’s top killers. These health issues are especially a burden among older adults. “The larger picture here is huge, that we should do these things — basic ones here being diet and exercise,” Gardner says, emphasizing the importance of preventing premature disease. In the study, researchers found that participants in the intensive programs saw, on average: A 1.5 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) drop in their systolic blood pressure (the top number on the reading) one year after losing weight. This number was still 0.4 mm Hg lower five years later. The American Heart Association considers a normal blood pressure to be less than 120 for the systolic reading and less than 80 for diastolic (the bottom number). ﻿ The percentage of HbA1c, a test that shows your average blood sugar levels, was reduced by 0.26﻿ at both the one- and five-year measurements. The ratio of total cholesterol to good cholesterol was 1.5 points lower at the one- and five-year measurements. The average weight loss across the different studies ranged from 5 to 10 pounds. Weight regain among participants — whose average age was 51 and whose average body mass index (BMI) was 33 — averaged 0.26 pounds to 0.7 pounds a year. Someone with a BMI of 18.5 – 24.9 is considered to be at a healthy weight; 25.0 – 29.9 is considered overweight; and 30 and above is considered obesity. ﻿ The researchers note that the health benefits observed diminished with greater weight regain. “Many doctors and patients recognize that weight loss is often followed by weight regain, and they fear that this renders an attempt to lose weight pointless,” study coauthor Susan A. Jebb, a professor of diet and population health at the University of Oxford, said in a news release. “This concept has become a barrier to offering support to people to lose weight. For people with overweight or obesity issues, losing weight is an effective way to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.” 6 Tips for Maintaining Weight Loss Know your triggers and work to avoid them. Keep your eating patterns consistent — make meal plans so you are more likely to have healthy foods on hand. Stay physically active. People who have lost weight and keep it off typically get 60 to 90 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity most days of the week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Break it up with walks in the morning, at lunch and in the evening. Check your weight regularly. Get support from family, friends and health care providers. All is not lost if you slip into old habits. You can still get back on track. Source: American Heart Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Jebb notes that more research is needed to see if the benefits persist after five years. Another thing that will be important to study going forward is how to help people maintain weight loss and, ideally, the health benefits that come with it, Gardner says. Regaining some weight after a weight loss program is common. Research shows that only a small share of people who lose weight are able to keep it off in the long run. Still, Gardner hopes this latest research encourages people who want to lose weight to try to do just that, even if they’re hesitant for fear of regaining some. “I hope they’ll see this and think long term, five years out, it would be worth it to make a try,” he says. “And if a little comes back, it looks like I’m going to benefit from this. So, it’s worth it to try.” 6 Tips for Maintaining Weight Loss Know your triggers and work to avoid them.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/have-trouble-sleeping/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series Suddenly Can’t Sleep? Here’s What May Be Causing Your Insomnia 14 surprising factors that can sabotage your shut-eye By Jessica Migala, AARP Updated July 30, 2024 Comments En español Published March 08, 2019 / Updated July 30, 2024 Getty Images In this story Age • Blue-lights • Menopause • Caffeine • Lack of routine﻿ • Poor sleeping environment • Long naps • Too much time in bed • Alcohol • Medications • Stress • Forced-sleep • Coexisting condition • Exercise • Treatment options • When to see a doctor Sleep. It’s as elusive as leprechaun gold, and twice as valuable. The number of health conditions linked to poor or inadequate sleep is almost endless, with obesity, diabetes and heart disease topping the list. But sleep ought to be something we can control — just get to bed early and sleep the night away, right? Unfortunately, it isn’t that simple. “It really begins with feeling safe. There are physical aspects of sleep and there are psychological aspects of sleep. But in the end, your state of mind trumps everything,” says Rafael Pelayo, M.D., a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences in sleep medicine at Stanford Medicine. SAM ISLAND If you find yourself lying in bed for hours unable to fall asleep, waking up during the night, or don’t feel refreshed in the morning, see if one of these factors is souring your sweet dreams. What is insomnia? Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can be caused by a variety of factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, medical conditions and medication side effects. Poor sleep habits, which sleep expert Nathaniel Watson, M.D., says “develop over a lifetime,” can also contribute. These habits may include not keeping to a regular sleep schedule, napping during the day or drinking too much alcohol right before bedtime. What’s more, hormonal fluctuations in women related to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and menopause can lead to insomnia, says Shelby Harris, clinical associate professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and director of sleep health at Sleepopolis. In this story Age • Blue-lights • Menopause • Caffeine • Lack of routine﻿ • Poor sleeping environment • Long naps • Too much time in bed • Alcohol • Medications • Stress • Forced-sleep • Coexisting condition • Exercise • Treatment options • When to see a doctor SAM ISLAND Temporary vs. chronic insomnia Insomnia is considered chronic when it occurs three nights a week for three months. Fewer nights of disrupted sleep would be indicative of short-term, or temporary, insomnia. “When people have these unhappy moments in their life, there’s probably a little bit of difficulty sleeping and we shouldn’t get too hung up on that,” says Watson, who is codirector of the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center. “If somebody’s having a short-term insomnia issue related to something happening in their life, I would caution people from catastrophizing around that and think of that as the normal experience of human emotion.” What causes insomnia? 1. Age Age, alone, can be to blame for your sleep troubles. For one, older adults are more susceptible to health issues that can disrupt sleep. Plus, as you age, your circadian rhythm changes, which is why you might notice wanting to go to bed earlier and, likewise, waking up earlier. For women in perimenopause and menopause, sleep disturbances often manifest hot flashes and night sweats. Adding to these difficulties, as we age our brain makes less melatonin, a hormone that tells us night is approaching and prepares us for sleep, says Pelayo. “It’s not chiseled in stone that as we get older that we’re going to have problematic sleep,” says Watson. “When we look at epidemiology, we do see that sleep difficulties do become more prevalent as we age, but it’s not necessarily predetermined.” If you’re battling age-related insomnia, it’s important to keep a consistent sleep schedule so you don’t skimp on the recommended seven hours a night. Try to go to bed at the same time every night to avoid those late-night, early-morning days. Sam Island 2. Blue-lights You’ve heard time and again to turn off electronics an hour or so before bed because these devices emit a blue light that suppresses melatonin. However, glaring blue light even three or four hours earlier — like watching TV during or shortly after dinner — is enough to delay melatonin production, says Karl Doghramji, M.D., director of the Jefferson Sleep Disorders Center in Philadelphia. You don’t have to turn off the tube, though. He recommends wearing eyeglasses that block blue light (available from a variety of online retailers) until you tuck in (and when you wake up at night too). That way, you’ll have no problems winding down with the TV on. 3. Menopause Declining estrogen can prompt disturbances — including hot flashes — in the middle of the night. Research indicates that about a quarter of menopausal women have sleep problems severe enough to impact their ability to function during the day. Head off hot, sweaty wakeups by using sheets and pajamas that wick moisture, and sleeping on a buckwheat pillow, which is more cooling than traditional latex or down, advises Harris, who wrote The Women’s Guide to Overcoming Insomnia. If your partner likes it warmer, consider having a separate comforter for each side of the bed. Sam Island 4. Caffeine While it may be intuitive that drinking coffee for an afternoon pick-me-up could interfere with your sleep later, “people often have no idea that they’re consuming caffeine in other forms, like iced tea or chocolate,” says Beth Ann Malow, M.D., director of the sleep disorders division of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Everyone metabolizes it at a different rate, so you may be surprised at what time of day you should be cutting off caffeine. “If you’re having trouble falling asleep, eliminate it after lunch,” she says. 5. Lack of a routine Humans like routines because they’re predictable and monotony tends to make people sleepy, Pelayo says. However, there is no one-size-fits all approach, since different things comfort different people. What’s most important is that your sleep routine signals relaxation, whether it’s a bath, meditation, prayer or even changing into clothes worn only for sleep. Routines aren’t just helpful before sleep either; they can also help you get out of bed and reinforce a consistent sleep schedule. Plan to do something you really enjoy first thing in the morning to encourage you to get out of bed and stick with a consistent wake-up time to help maintain a regular sleep schedule. 6. Poor sleep environment A good sleep environment starts with feeling safe, Pelayo says. “We want people to go to bed feeling safe, comfortable and loved.” Temperature is crucial; your bedroom should be between 65 and 68 °F, according to the Sleep Foundation. Cooling sheets may also help. Dark rooms help stimulate melatonin production, so in addition to shades that keep out light, make sure to douse lights from any electronic devices. Exposure to bright light, especially in the morning, can also help you sleep at night, because it can help keep our circadian clocks on track. In fact, multiple studies show that cataract surgery, which increases light entering the eye, can improve melatonin production by intensifying daytime light exposure, strengthening the signal that night is approaching. For noise, if you prefer silence, embrace it. But, if it comforts you, use it — whether its a podcast, fan or a sound machine. Make sure the sound is continuous and non-looping to avoid disruptions and set a timer for a podcast so the continued talk doesn’t wake you back up. “The brain is very active when it’s sleeping. It’s doing maintenance. It also has background monitoring,” says Pelayo. Therefore, sudden noises or interruptions can disturb sleep. Lastly, if keeping your phone nearby makes you feel safe, keep it within reach, Pelayo says. But, if it becomes something you obsess over, consider placing it in another room. Know that you can put your phone in ‘do not disturb’ mode to prevent notifications or configure it to only accept calls from specific contacts during sleeping hours. Sam Island Sam Island 7. Long naps “Many adults don’t nap voluntarily or intentionally, but often fall asleep when not busy or watching TV,” says Doghramji. Either way, your brain sees it as sleep. The most common time of the day when people get sleepy is between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, when we experience a natural dip in energy, he says. This may prevent you from feeling tired at bedtime; then spending too much time lying awake can contribute to insomnia. If your afternoon energy tends to be low, try scheduling something active for that time instead of napping. It will help you feel refreshed, and research shows that exercisers have better sleep quality too — so it’s a double bang for your buck. If a nap calls your name, Pelayo suggests sleeping no longer than 40 minutes to avoid feeling groggy later. Rest your head where you normally sleep so you remain accustomed to the same sleep environment. SAM ISLAND 8. Spending too much time in bed Reading may be a relaxing activity but you should take your book to an armchair — not your bed, Harris advises. “I prefer that the bed is only used for sleep and sex,” she says. Even calm activities like puzzles or an adult coloring book can cause your brain to associate the bed with activities that you pursue while awake, which can affect your ability to drift off at night. 9. Alcohol Yep, a glass of vino can simmer you down and make it easier to fall asleep. However, research shows that while it may help you conk out, there’s also a rebound effect that causes lighter and more fragmented sleep in the second half of the night; that’s why you’re up at 3 a.m. It also decreases sleep quality — so you rise less refreshed. SAM ISLAND Limit alcohol to three hours before bedtime and imbibe moderately (one drink for women and two for men, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 10. Medications Sleep can also be interrupted by poor timing of your medications. Some, like diuretics for blood pressure, can make you have to urinate more often. More than one or two bathroom breaks at night is abnormal, Doghramji says. Antidepressant SSRIs, can either be energizing or sedating, depending what type you’re on. Steroids like prednisone, beta blockers like propranolol and certain asthma medications are best taken in the morning to avoid sleep disruptions. Always consult your doctor before changing the timing of your medication. See ""Common Medications That Can Affect Sleep"" for more details. SAM ISLAND 11. Stress ﻿Dealing with stress can make falling asleep difficult, leading to light, fragmented sleep. However, there are tools to help alleviate stress-related insomnia. For example, if you’re stressed over bills, avoid reviewing or addressing them in your bedroom. “Put it in a separate room so when you go to your room, it’s a different world,” says Pelayo who also wrote How to Sleep: The New Science﻿-Based Solutions for Sleeping Through the Night. If you have persistent thoughts that trap you in a cycle of negative feelings, schedule a dedicated time to think or worry. Consider journaling or writing a simple list, whether it’s what you need from the grocery store or even jotting down short- and long-term goals. “Say it and believe it, then put that aside,” says Pelayo.﻿ ﻿""Now do something that you enjoy. Reach for pleasure, a warm bath or time with your spouse.” These activities can be incorporated into your sleep routine to signal to your body that you are transitioning into sleep mode and the day is over. ﻿Problems may seem less intense in the morning than they do at night. Finally, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), can help you retrain your thoughts to calm your mind, Doghramji says. A specially trained CBT-I therapist can help, but there are also apps that teach you these important skills. “Don’t just use them at 3 a.m.; practice with these apps during the day.” 12. Forced-sleep As you get older you may start going to bed earlier but you may want to consider pushing it back later. “You want a later bedtime, but a locked in wake-up time. That’s going to squeeze out those middle of the night awakening… and the body’s going to sleep deeper,” says Pelayo. Lying in bed trying to force sleep to happen out of boredom backfires, Harris says. It can convince your brain that being awake in bed is normal. Instead, get up and go into a different room and do something relaxing and calm in dim light, she advises. (No screens allowed.) Having an accepting mindset about it can also help. “Sleep will come when it comes. If not tonight, don’t sleep in to compensate — and you’ll likely sleep better the next night,” she says. 13. Health condition affecting sleep “Insomnia is both a symptom and a disease,” says Watson. If correcting your sleep habits hasn’t improved it﻿s quality, your insomnia may be a symptom of another condition. There are over 80 sleep disorders, many which include insomnia as a symptom. These include sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, parasomnia (such as sleepwalking, talking or eating) and narcolepsy. While a relatively rare condition, older adults in particular are susceptible to REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), where individuals physically act out their dreams while asleep. This not only may cause injury to oneself or their bed partner but can be an early warning sign of Parkinson’s, Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy, a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects the body's involuntary functions, and should be treated by a doctor. Other non-sleep disorders that may cause insomnia include pain, arthritis, atrial fibrillation, PTSD and heartburn, according to Pelayo. If you’ve tried the correcting your sleep on your own for a month and it still doesn’t feel adequate, see your doctor for an evaluation. 14. Exercising too close to bedtime Exercise offers numerous benefits for better sleep, such as reducing anxiety and depression and realigning your circadian rhythm. But working out too close to bedtime may be counterproductive. Exercise can heat up your body or make you feel more alert which can make it harder to sleep. Instead, aim to exercise at least two hours before bed to allow these effects to wear off. Treatment options for insomnia Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I): This is typically recommended as the first-line treatment because it identifies and addresses habits, behaviors, thoughts and other factors that keep you awake during the night. Think of it as getting a toolbox for overcoming insomnia. Medication: Those who opt for medication should know that there can be side effects and limitations for long term use. For older adults, sleeping pills can be especially dangerous due to the risk of mobility problems and falls. However, if you’re dealing with temporary insomnia, your doctor might give you a short-term prescription. Alternatively, a relatively new category of medication called dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) has proven to be well tolerated in older adults with insomnia and can be a good alternative to traditional prescription sleeping pills. Over-the-counter options: In general, it’s best to steer clear of over-the-counter options like melatonin, Tylenol PM or Advil PM. They may not provide the most effective solution and could mask an underlying medical condition responsible for insomnia, which might require a doctor’s evaluation, says Watson.﻿ “If you’re just addressing the insomnia yourself over the counter, you might miss an opportunity to address the root cause.” Alcohol: While alcohol may help you fall asleep initally, as it wears off, your sleep becomes more disrupted toward the last half of the night. Cannabis: The role of cannabis in promoting sleep remains uncertain, and its potential effects are still being researched. When to see a doctor You should reach out to a doctor when insomnia begins to impact your daytime function or if you routinely have trouble with your sleep quality or quantity, multiple nights a week. Working with a sleep specialist or other another health care professional is important for managing insomnia because you can identify the root causes of your sleeplessness and establish a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs. “Modern sleep medicine has reached a point where most sleep disorder will improve when addressed correctly,” Pelayo says. “So you shouldn’t suffer with a sleep disorder anymore.” SAM ISLAND SAM ISLAND SAM ISLAND Jessica Migala has written for Marie Claire, Prevention and more than 30 other publications.","The article explores the central theme of insomnia, examining the various factors that can disrupt sleep and providing insights into its causes and treatment. Key findings include the importance of maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding stimulating activities before bedtime, and managing stress, as well as the potential impact of factors such as age, blue light exposure, and certain medications on sleep quality. A novel insight is that insomnia is not just a standalone condition, but can be a symptom of underlying health issues, such as sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment.",177
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/updated-covid-vaccines-approved/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by 7 Things to Know About the New COVID Vaccines FDA approves updated coronavirus shots for 2024-2025 By Rachel Nania, Updated October 24, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published August 22, 2024 / Updated October 24, 2024 AARP (Getty Images (2)) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed off on updated versions of coronavirus vaccine that target a more recent variant of the virus that was behind this summer’s surge in COVID-19 cases. The new shots — one from Moderna﻿, another from Pfizer/BioNTech and a third from Novavax — are available at pharmacies and doctors’ offices across the country﻿, and infectious disease experts hope the reformulated vaccines will help to keep cases from swelling this fall and winter. Here are seven things you need to know about the updated COVID-19 vaccines. 1. The mRNA vaccines target a FLiRT variant During the summer, the FDA recommended that vaccine manufacturers target the KP.2 coronavirus strain in the 2024-2025 COVID vaccines. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. At the time, KP.2, a member of the FLiRT variant family and a descendant of omicron, was behind a large share of increasing infections in the U.S. Though this particular strain is no longer among the top circulating variants, its close relatives are, and health experts expect that the updated vaccines will provide strong protection against them as well. The FLiRT variants all came from the same parent strain, explains Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. “And there are very, very minimal mutational changes between all of them.” 2. Another shot can restore waning immunity It’s not just about making sure we have a vaccine that targets the most recent versions of the virus, Guest says. It’s also about restoring faded immunity. Paying for a COVID vaccine ﻿ Most people with Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance can get an updated COVID vaccine at no cost through their health plans, the CDC says. Health officials urge individuals without insurance to contact their state or local health department for information about free vaccines, now that the national Bridge Access Program has ended. You can find a directory of state and local health departments on the CDC’s website. “We know that immunity from this vaccine diminishes over time,” she says, so the vaccine you received last year isn’t providing you with optimal protection now. Though the summer surge has receded, around 1,000 Americans are still dying from the disease each week, the latest data from the week of Sept. 21 shows. “I think the population would like to put the pandemic in the rearview mirror and not really think about it anymore. But the virus is still very much with us and still continues to cause problems,” says Mark Rupp, M.D., a professor and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The vast majority of COVID hospitalizations that occurred from October 2023 to March 2024 were among individuals who were not vaccinated or not up to date on their vaccinations, according to data presented at a meeting of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory committee. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Paying for a COVID vaccine ﻿ Most people with Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance can get an updated COVID vaccine at no cost through their health plans, the CDC says. Health officials urge individuals without insurance to contact their state or local health department for information about free vaccines, now that the national Bridge Access Program has ended. You can find a directory of state and local health departments on the CDC’s website. 3. Vaccines can reduce the risk of long COVID Who will get the COVID vaccine? According to recent findings from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, 45 percent of adults age 50-plus plan to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall. A few other findings: 59 percent of adults age 75 and older plan to get the vaccine. 51 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 plan to get the vaccine. 37 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 plan to get the vaccine. Beyond restoring protection from a short-term illness, the CDC says, the vaccines can reduce the likelihood “of suffering the effects of long COVID,” which has impacted an estimated 17 million U.S. adults, according to a report from the health policy nonprofit KFF. Long COVID — marked by symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, headaches and joint and muscle pain — can creep in after a coronavirus infection clears and last for months, even years. Symptoms can be so severe for some people that they can result in a disability, the CDC says. “That risk of long COVID is there and it’s real, and it can be minimized by getting vaccinated,” Rupp says. 4. Virtually everyone should get new vaccine The CDC recommended that everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID vaccination once it’s available. “It’s really important that everyone get this vaccine; it is even more important than anyone 60 and older get it,” Guest says. “And we just can't stress enough that the majority of the severe complications from COVID-19, and unfortunately the fact that we still have deaths … they’re more likely to be among people who are older than 60. And so getting this is really important to protect them from consequences like that.” If you’re 65 and older, plan to go back in the spring for a second shot. On Oct. 23, the CDC issued a recommendation for people 65-plus and those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised to receive a second dose of 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine six months after their first dose. Who will get the COVID vaccine? According to recent findings from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, 45 percent of adults age 50-plus plan to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall. A few other findings: 59 percent of adults age 75 and older plan to get the vaccine. 51 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 plan to get the vaccine. 37 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 plan to get the vaccine. “For the past several years at least, we've had two increases of COVID a year. There's a summer increase, and then it abates, and then we have another, and usually larger, winter increase,” says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. “And we know that the COVID vaccines provide good protection in the short-term, but by the time you get to month four, five and six, that protection begins to wane.” The idea is a second shot in the spring can protect older adults through the summer surge, until an updated vaccine is released in the fall, he explains. 5. The (mostly mild) side effects remain the same Not everyone experiences side effects after vaccination, but some people do, and the FDA says for those individuals, there are no surprises with the updated vaccines. Common side effects can include: Pain, swelling and redness at the injection site FatigueHeadacheMuscle painChillsNauseaFever Side effects tend to be mild and generally go away in a few days, the CDC says. “These updated vaccines meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality,” Peter Marks, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. 6. You can get your COVID and flu shots at the same time If you’re looking to save time and an extra trip to the clinic, you can get your COVID vaccine and flu shot — even the RSV vaccine, too — at the same time. The optimal time to get the flu shot is September and October, the CDC says. Where you live may influence your decision on whether to pair up flu and COVID vaccines. “The northern half of the country tends to see the flu season start close to a month earlier than the southern part of the country,” Guest says. “And so in the northern states, I would not even consider waiting. I would go ahead and get both if they were available. If they are not available for some reason, and only COVID is, I would get the COVID [vaccine now] and then go back [for your flu shot].” 7. An updated vaccine from Novavax is authorized Novavax’s vaccine — which uses a more traditional (protein-based) technology from the mRNA vaccines — was authorized by the FDA on Aug. 30 for individuals 12 and older. Instead of targeting the KP.2 variant, Novavax’s 2024-2025 vaccine targets JN.1, which the company describes as “the ‘parent strain’ of currently circulating variants.” It’s expected to provide strong protection from the variants that are spreading, Rupp says. Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","The article discusses the updated COVID-19 vaccines approved by the FDA for the 2024-2025 season. The key findings are that the new vaccines target recent variants of the virus, can restore waning immunity, and reduce the risk of long COVID. Notably, the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID vaccination, with a second dose recommended for those 65 and older six months after the first dose.",178
https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/surprising-foods-that-cause-weight-gain/,"12 Foods That May Cause Unhealthy Weight Gain French fries and pizza aren’t the only foods that can contribute to excess fat gain By Stephanie Watson, Updated March 18, 2025 AARP Medically reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published August 31, 2023 / Updated March 18, 2025 Getty Images Have you ever found yourself staring longingly at a piece of fried chicken but then thinking, If I eat this, it’s going straight to my belly and thighs? You’re not entirely wrong. Consuming too much of certain foods can lead to excess fat accumulation, making it harder to maintain a healthy weight. While your body uses mostly carbs and protein for energy, foods that are high in saturated fat, like that fried chicken, can contribute to weight gain. “Unless you need that fat right now in this moment, it’s going to get stored,” says Melanie Murphy Richter, a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian. “It is true that excess fat has a direct line to your belly, and to other places where you hold fat in your adipose tissue.” It’s no surprise that certain foods are notorious for stubborn fat gains (we’re looking at you, burgers, French fries and milkshakes). However, there are other foods that seem healthy, until the scale tells us otherwise. Want to avoid these hidden weight gain traps? Here are 12 foods that can add unwanted calories, sugars and fats to your diet. 1. Fat-free or low-fat cookies and muffins Something labeled fat-free﻿ or low-fat certainly can’t make you gain weight! That’s what food manufacturers would like you to believe. Back in the 1950s, the average American diet was heavy on meat and potatoes. As heart disease rates soared, researchers began connecting the dots between a diet high in saturated fat and heart disease. Food manufacturers responded by producing lots of low-fat foods. “The problem is that fat is what makes food taste good,” says Richter. To compensate, food companies replaced fat with sugar, which can also contribute to fat accumulation. Thanks in part to packaged foods, American adults now eat an average of ﻿1﻿7﻿ teaspoons of sugar a day, which is more than two to three times the recommended limit of 9 teaspoons a day for men and 6 teaspoons daily for women that the American Heart Association recommends. While your total calories matter, “avoiding simple sugars is most important to prevent weight gain,” says Felix Spiegel, M.D., a bariatric surgeon with Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston, Texas. Researchers point to sugar as a major contributor to obesity. It’s also been linked to other health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and cancer, says Richter. Tip: Avoid packaged low-fat sweets and opt for whole foods like fruit or homemade snacks with natural ingredients and no added sugar. 2. Flavored yogurt Even if it’s labeled “fat-free,” yogurt is a hidden source of added sugar. A 6-ounce container of chocolate nonfat yogurt contains 25 grams of sugar — more than an entire day’s worth for women. This doesn’t mean yogurt is unhealthy. Not only does it have protein and calcium, many yogurts have bacteria that are great for your gut health. Tip: Rather than eat flavored yogurts that are packed with sugars, go for plain Greek yogurt and stir in fruit or a bit of honey. Yes, honey is a type of sugar as well, but it has numerous health benefits and is less processed than refined sugar. Just don’t overdo it: One teaspoon of honey has about 6 grams of sugar. 3. White ﻿bagels This breakfast staple, especially in the white or plain form, i﻿s just one example of a simple carbohydrate that can spike blood sugar and contribute to excess fat storage. Muffins, cookies, white bread and cereal are other types of simple carbs.﻿ Why do these foods cause weight gain? “One is the calories. If you’re eating more calories, you’ll gain weight,” says Adam Goldstein, M.D., director of the University of North Carolina Weight Management Program in Chapel Hill. A large bagel packs more than 360 calories. Add a schmear of cream cheese at 100 calories, and you’ve already consumed nearly a quarter of your daily allotment if you’re on a 2,000-calorie diet. The second reason is the quick-digesting nature of simple carbs. They leave you feeling hungry sooner, leading to overeating, says Goldstein.﻿ Tip: If you need a bagel fix, look for one made from whole wheat or whole grains and consider having just half, with fresh fruit on the side. 4. Red meat Before you order a side of bacon to accompany your eggs or dig into a T-bone steak, consider this: A study that followed the diet and exercise habits of more than 120,000 people for up to 20 years linked processed and red meat to one pound of weight gain every four years (in addition to weight gain from other foods). Meat is particularly problematic for putting on pounds because it contains protein and saturated fat, both of which promote weight gain. That’s not the only bad news about meat. “Too much animal protein has also been scientifically linked to inflammation in the body, which can also cause weight gain,” Richter says. Tip: If you reach for red meat go for a lean steak or burger. Otherwise, treat red meat as sideshow to your diet and not the main attraction, she adds. 5. Fried fish Fish like salmon, tuna and shrimp are high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, low in saturated fat and high in protein. However, when you dredge your fish in flour and deep fry it in hot oil. you’re adding calories and unhealthy fat, which can contribute to unwanted weight gain Tip: Rather than fry fish, bake, broil or grill it to get the numerous health benefits. 6. Plant-based dairy foods (with added sugar) Avoiding dairy is fine, especially if you’re lactose-intolerant, but be cautious of plant-based substitutes like cashew, almond or coconut yogurt, ice cream and milk. “My patients are trying to make healthy swaps. They think they’re doing the right thing, but they’re just trading one evil for another,” Richter says. Because plant-based foods don’t have the same texture and flavor as dairy, manufacturers add sugar to compensate, contributing to fat gain. Tip: Look for the unsweetened versions of plant-based dairy products to cut down on added sugar. 7. Sodas, alcohol and other sugary drinks It might be easy to connect the contents of your plate with the higher numbers on your scale, but what’s in your glass also factors into your weight-loss struggles. Regular sodas and other sugary beverages are one of the biggest culprits when it comes to excess calorie intake. When you order your Starbucks coffee with extra cream and lots of sugar, “now it’s basically like a chocolate bar,” says Richter. Even diet soft drinks are linked to weight gain, possibly by making you crave﻿ more sugary, high-calorie foods. Some drinks hide under the guise of healthfulness, like kombucha. It seems like a healthy beverage option — after all, it’s made with fermented tea. In reality, “it has a ton of added sugar in it,” says Richter. Many fruit and vegetable juice drinks also contain lots of sugar. If you are watching your weight, eat an orange or an apple instead of drinking orange or apple juice. Alcoholic drinks are double offenders, especially mixed drinks. A piña colada packs a whopping 245 calories and 31 grams of sugar. Alcohol also promotes inflammation, which contributes to weight gain. Tip: Stick to water, unsweetened tea or black coffee. For some extra flavor, throw a lemon, mint or berries into your drink. 8. Nuts These foods constitute a whole different type of fat — the mono- and polyunsaturated kinds that are rich in antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory properties. They’re good for your health and therefore worthy of eating. But because they’re high in calories per ounce, you’ll want to eat these healthy fats in moderation to avoid weight gain, sa﻿ys Spiegel. Tips: Stick to small servings, like one tablespoon of peanut butter or a handful of nuts—not the whole jar. 9. Olive oil While olive oil is a great choice for cooking and dressings, a little goes a long way—one tablespoon has just over 100 calories. “Since it has plenty of benefits, it’s still an important part of our everyday diet - but best to use it as a drizzle rather than a glug if you’re focused on weight,” says Rachel Gargano, chief registered dietitian at Live it Up and a nutritionist with board certifications in sports dietetics and breastfeeding. Tip: Use a measuring spoon instead of eyeballing your pour to keep portions in check. 10. Smoothies Smoothies can be a great way to pack in nutrients, but they’re also an easy place to rack up extra calories. Too much nut butter, chia or flax seeds, added sugar, or a high-fat base can turn a healthy smoothie into a calorie bomb. “The body doesn’t recognize liquid calories the same as eating solid foods, it can be easier to drink more calories than what the body needs,” says Gargano Tip: Use a protein-rich base like Greek yogurt or unsweetened milk and balance your smoothie with fiber-rich ingredients like berries or spinach to help keep you full. 11. Salads Salads can be loaded with fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals—but what you put on them matters. Piling on cheese, bacon bits, croutons or creamy dressings can pack more calories than you expect. Tip: Keep your portions in check when using calorie-dense toppings and opt for a light vinaigrette instead of creamy dressings. For an even bigger nutritional boost, go for a variety of colorful veggies and lean proteins to keep you full. 12. Low calorie ultra-processed food While it may be obvious that packaged cookies, chips, and fast food should be avoided, frozen meals—even the ones labeled “low calorie”—fall into the ultra-processed category too. Most ultra-processed foods are loaded with added sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium, but there’s another issue: how the body processes them. “The processing makes it easier for our bodies to absorb more calories than from whole foods, and they require fewer calories to digest, which makes overeating more likely,"" she says. Studies show people who eat more ultra-processed foods tend to eat much more calories per day than those stick to a diet richer than whole foods. Tip: Instead of frozen meals, try meal prepping and keep ready-made healthy meals in your freezer. And when it comes to snacks on-the-go reach for fruit or plain yogurt instead of chips. Focus on the big picture Eating a high-fat or sugary food once in a while isn’t going to lead to weight gain. It’s more about the quality of your diet as a whole, says Dr. Goldstein. Fill your plate with nutrient-dense foods like lean proteins, nonstarchy vegetables and fiber-rich fruits to help reduce calorie intake without feeling deprived “We don’t want people to restrict, thinking, I can’t have this,” he adds. “You can have almost anything you want, in moderation.” Bottom line: Eating more of the foods that won’t make you gain weight, like nonstarchy vegetables and berries, will leave less room for foods higher in calories, saturated fat and added sugar. Remember that your diet should be not only healthy, but also sustainable. “That’s the real key,” says Goldstein. “Anyone can lose weight. The question is, can anyone keep weight off?""

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/coffee-health-benefits/,"6 Surprising Health Benefits of Coffee Evidence is pouring in that drinking a cup of joe — or three — can help with everything from managing blood sugar to getting more from a workout epicurean/Getty Images By Kimberly Goad, Updated October 21, 2022 AARP En español Published September 20, 2021 / Updated October 21, 2022 Caffeine lovers looking for a healthy way to get their daily fix have long been led to believe that tea ﻿offers ﻿greater health and wellness ﻿benefits. Not anymore. Nutrition experts and medical researchers are finding all kinds of reasons to recommend indulging in that cup of joe, most of them rooted in the fact that coffee is the a potent source of antioxidants. ""Coffee is abundant in bioactive compounds that promote health,” says Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic. As she explains, research published in The New England Journal of Medicine shows that these compounds may improve the gut microbiome (made up of healthy bacteria that aid in digestion and ﻿boost immunity)﻿ and reduce ﻿what's called oxidative stress, ﻿which occurs when free radicals outnumber antioxidants in a way that leads to disease-causing cellular damage in the body. “The beans also have a deep rich hue,"" Kirkpatrick says, ""and we know that the deeper the color of a plant, the more benefits we can expect for health.” ﻿Those benefits, research shows, translate in﻿to everything from lowering your risk of diabetes to potentially boosting ﻿your brain health. Moderation, of course, is key. According to dietary guidelines, three to five 8-ounce cups of coffee — or up to 400 mg of caffeine — per day can be part of a healthy diet. But that’s true only for plain black coffee, not cappuccinos, lattes and macchiatos, which are typically high in calories, sugar and fat. Keep in mind﻿ that “some medications or health conditions may limit your tolerance to caffeine or its safety profile, so discuss this with your health﻿ care provider,” says Jill Weisenberger, a registered dietitian nutritionist and author of Prediabetes: A Complete Guide: Your Lifestyle Reset to Stop Prediabetes and Other Chronic Illnesses﻿. ​Here﻿ are six solid health benefits of coffee ﻿that give you ﻿even more reason to enjoy your next cup (or three).﻿﻿ 1. Lowers your risk of type 2 diabetes This will perk you up, especially if you have prediabetes: A review of studies published in 2021 in the journal ﻿Nutrients﻿ found that drinking coffee on a regular basis may help people with prediabetes from progressing to full-blown diabetes. Why? “Coffee is jam-packed with phytochemicals that may act as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, insulin-sensitivity boosters and more,” Weisenberger says. Same goes for decaffeinated brews, “though the concentration [of phytochemicals] may be less compared to regular coffee,” she ﻿says. “However, they still add up for people who drink lots of decaf.” Whether you fill your cup with caf or decaf, opt for filtered coffee. In a study published in the Journal of Internal Medicine﻿, people who drank two to three cups of filtered coffee a day — as opposed to unfiltered coffee made with, say, a pod, an espresso machine or a French press — had a 60 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than people who drank less than one cup of filtered coffee a day. Those drinking unfiltered coffee did not see such﻿ a reduction in risk. 2. ﻿Protects your ticker (in quite a few ways) As counterintuitive as it may seem, your go-to for kick﻿-starting the day ﻿or powering﻿ you through a sluggish afternoon has heart-healthy benefits. A review of three major studies published in Circulation: Heart Failure found that drinking one or more cups of plain caffeinated coffee a day may reduce your risk for heart failure. (Decaf didn’t ﻿yield the same benefits﻿.) A large study published last spring in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology suggests that the benefits of coffee extend to your overall cardiovascular system. Among people without diagnosed heart disease, researchers found that ﻿drinking up to three cups of coffee per day was associated with a lower risk of stroke, death from cardiovascular disease and death from any cause. To understand why, researchers examined magnetic resonance imaging results ﻿for more than 30,000 study participants. The MRIs showed that the daily coffee drinkers had healthier﻿-sized and better﻿ functioning hearts﻿ than﻿ those who didn’t drink coffee regularly﻿, though experts say ﻿more research is needed to fully understand the connection﻿.﻿ Again, drink filtered coffee﻿. “Unfiltered coffee contains two compounds that raise LDL cholesterol in some people,” Weisenberger says. High levels of LDL cholesterol ﻿increase your risk for heart disease and stroke. 3. Boosts brain health (if you don't overdo it) Can a coffee habit reduce your risk for dementia? Scientists aren’t sure, but some research suggests ﻿that regular caffeine consumption may﻿ indeed offer protection. A long-term study published in 2021 in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience found that coffee-drinking participants with no memory impairments at the start of the study had a lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment﻿ —﻿ which often precedes Alzheimer’s disease — or Alzheimer’s itself over the course of the 10-year study, compared with those who didn’t drink coffee. Participants were almost ﻿70 years old on average.﻿ ﻿Careful on the refills. “New data suggests that having over ﻿five or six cups a day may have an adverse health impact on the brain,” Kirkpatrick says, ﻿citing the results of a﻿ large study published in 2021 in Nutritional Neuroscience.. Researchers who studied the brain scans of more than 17,000 people ages 37 to 73 found that drinking six or more cups of coffee a day was associated with smaller total brain volume and an increased risk of dementia. The researchers pointed out that the study couldn’t confirm the underlying reason for the association, just that ﻿the more coffee people drank, the more brain shrinkage their scans showed.4. Improves your mood — for longer than you'd guess 4. Improves your mood — for longer than you’d guess You don’t need an expert to tell you how much better that first jolt of morning java can make you feel. But what you may not know is that the effects ﻿could be more than fleeting. Drinking coffee may reduce your risk of depression by ﻿nearly one﻿-third, according to research from Harvard Medical School. The effect may be related to coffee’s anti-inflammatory properties, Weisenberger explains. “Researchers suspect that both coffee and some antidepressant medications lower the body’s levels of inflammation, which may have an effect on depression. What’s more, coffee has phytochemicals that feed the good bacteria in our guts. The good bacteria may produce or enhance other compounds that act on the brain and have beneficial effects on mood.” How much do you need to drink to reap the reward? At least four cups per day, suggests one study, published in 2018 in Nutrients. Participants who drank four or more cups a day showed a lower risk of depression than those who drank a cup or less. (But don’t forget the caution about six or more cups a day.) 5. Gives your workout a measurable assist It’s not your imagination: ﻿Downing a cup﻿ of joe before you head off to the gym can make a difference in your workout. Why? When consumed before work﻿ing out, coffee improves circulation, endurance and muscular strength﻿ —﻿ plus, it may reduce pain, according to a review of research published in 2019 in Sports Medicine. Keep in mind, though, that coffee can also act as a diuretic﻿. ﻿The U.S. Food and Drug Administration﻿ recommends that caffeine lovers drink extra water ﻿during exercise to avoid dehydration, especially in the heat. ﻿How long before your workout should you drink coffee to maximize the benefits? Most research ﻿suggests drinking coffee within an hour of your start time, though at least one study shows drinking ﻿coffee a half﻿-hour before you work﻿ out may boost fat﻿-burning in particular. 6. May help you live longer Considering all the heart-healthy benefits in your morning brew, it’s no surprise that coffee is linked to a longer lifespan. It’s protective in other ways, too. A new study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology suggests that drinking two to three cups of coffee a day﻿ —﻿ whether it’s caffeinated﻿, decaffeinated or instant —﻿ not only reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, it also lowers the risk of dying from any cause. Caffeine doesn’t get all the credit. As the researchers pointed out, coffee also contains more than 100 biologically active good-for-you components. How to Pick the Best Creamer Add-ins﻿ —﻿ whether a powdered creamer or ﻿a high-calorie, sugar-laden flavoring﻿ —﻿ can ﻿quickly strip coffee of its good-for-you status. “Coffee with a couple pumps of vanilla or hazelnut syrup and heavy cream is an indulgence we should save for the rare treat,” notes Weisenberger, who recommends a nonfat latte or a cup of coffee with a splash of low-fat milk as a healthy standard. Beyond that, be sure to check ﻿the label on any creamer. A lot of store-bought options aren’t dairy products, and you’ll want to skip those with ingredients such as carrageenan, a thickener believed to cause inflammation and digestion problems. The best options, says the Cleveland Clinic’s Kirkpatrick, will have only one or two ingredients. From there, be sure to scan the Nutrition Facts ﻿label for added sugars and saturated fats. “Both should be as low as possible,” Weisenberger says. If you really want sweetness, consider stevia, a sugar substitute. Finally, know that the serving size listed in ﻿the Nutrition Facts on most coffee creamers ﻿is typically one tablespoon. So be sure to do the math if you’re adding creamer to multiple cups of coffee or, say, a jumbo 24-ounce cup. Not only do the calories add up, but so does the sugar — especially, Kirkpatrick notes, with many plant-based options such as oat﻿ milk or almond milk. 5 Surprising Health Benefits of Coffee How to Pick the Best Creamer Add-ins﻿ —﻿ whether a powdered creamer or ﻿a high-calorie, sugar-laden flavoring﻿ —﻿ can ﻿quickly strip coffee of its good-for-you status. “Coffee with a couple pumps of vanilla or hazelnut syrup and heavy cream is an indulgence we should save for the rare treat,” notes Weisenberger, who recommends a nonfat latte or a cup of coffee with a splash of low-fat milk as a healthy standard.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/eat-more-fiber/,"5 Good Reasons You Should Eat More Fiber Every Day New research suggests the powerhouse nutrient helps with a variety of health issues By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published February 13, 2025 Ellis Parrinder/Gallery Stock It’s common for people to count their calories, log their protein intake and monitor their salt and sugar consumption. But amid all this food tracking, many Americans are forgetting about a key nutrient linked to lower cancer risk, weight loss, better cholesterol and a more robust immune system. We’re talking about fiber, and research shows that most people in the U.S. aren’t eating enough of it. One study published in 2021 found that only about 7 percent of Americans meet the recommended fiber intake of 14 grams per 1,000 calories of food, or 28 grams for a 2,000-calorie daily diet. A previous study concluded that only 5 percent of Americans consume enough fiber. “I don’t think fiber is necessarily on people’s radar,” says Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Mayo Clinic. “And I don’t think fiber gets a whole lot of press.” One reason: We’re just beginning to discover its benefits throughout the body — beyond keeping it regular, which is the role most people typically associate with fiber. “We’re so early in the science of it,” Zeratsky says. “It’s just a really exciting area.” Here are five reasons you should add more fiber into your diet this year, based on the latest health research. The different types of fiber There are two main types of fiber: Soluble: Found in oats, peas, beans, bananas, apples, carrots and citrus fruits. This type of fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like material in the stomach to slow digestion. Insoluble: Found in whole-wheat flour, beans, potatoes and vegetables such as cauliflower. This type of fiber doesn’t dissolve in water; it helps keep things moving through the digestive tract and adds bulk to the stool. Source: Mayo Clinic 1. Fiber can lower your cancer risk A high-fiber diet has been linked to a lower risk of several types of cancer — from breast to pancreatic — and the reasons run the gamut. Researchers point to fiber’s ability to help the body maintain a healthy weight, and obesity is linked to 13 different cancers. Fiber can also help control blood sugar, and high blood sugar is a risk factor for some cancers. Some researchers point to fiber-deficient diets as one explanation for the recent rise in colorectal cancer cases in young adults. Fiber helps to dilute stool and move it through the intestine quickly, reducing the time that cancer-causing chemicals and ingredients from food are exposed to the intestinal lining, explains Urvi A. Shah, M.D., a hematologist-oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Another plus: Microbes living in the gut can ferment fiber into compounds with tumor-suppressive effects, a study in JAMA Oncology explains. Scientists are studying how fiber can help combat certain blood cancers. Recent research presented by Shah at the 2024 American Society of Hematology annual meeting followed 20 patients with an elevated BMI and a precancerous blood disorder that put them at risk for developing multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that forms in the white blood cells. After incorporating more fiber in their diets, none of the participants progressed to multiple myeloma after one year, the researchers found. Two participants with progressing disease prior to the study showed a significant slowing of their disease progression. “I don’t think it’s just limited to myeloma,” Shah says. “We’ve shown it for this cancer, but I think these findings are important for probably many cancers.” Eating a fiber-rich diet may also improve your outcomes if you already have cancer. A study by researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center and published in Science found that patients with melanoma who ate more fiber-rich foods when they started immunotherapy survived longer than those who didn’t eat much fiber. In fact, every 5-gram increase of daily fiber was associated with a 30 percent lower risk of cancer growth or death. The different types of fiber There are two main types of fiber: Soluble: Found in oats, peas, beans, bananas, apples, carrots and citrus fruits. This type of fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like material in the stomach to slow digestion. Insoluble: Found in whole-wheat flour, beans, potatoes and vegetables such as cauliflower. This type of fiber doesn’t dissolve in water; it helps keep things moving through the digestive tract and adds bulk to the stool. Source: Mayo Clinic 2. Fiber helps with weight — and weight-related diseases If you’re trying to lose weight — or maintain your current numbers — doctors and nutrition experts will tell you that fiber is your friend. The body can’t digest fiber like it can other nutrients, so it moves slowly through the stomach and helps keep you feeling full for longer. “It’s so easy to binge on a bag of potato chips, but we’re not going to binge on carrots, for example, because there’s so much fiber your body is going to feel full; it’s not even going to allow you to binge on something like that,” says Shonali Soans, a dietician in the Integrative Health and Wellbeing program at Weill Cornell Medicine. “It is satiating, so you automatically eat fewer calories,” Shah adds. In addition to helping you drop pounds, fiber has been found to help lower blood pressure and keep blood sugar levels in check, which can quell food cravings that accompany sugar spikes and crashes. As opposed to insoluble fiber, soluble fiber — found in foods like oats and beans — can reduce the “bad” cholesterol in your blood, known as low-density lipoprotein, or LDL. Research has also linked fiber consumption to inflammation reduction. “Because if our digestive health and our blood sugar is normalized and our weight is managed, that’s going to help overall [lower] inflammation,” Soans says. 3. Fiber improves your gut health It’s impossible to discuss fiber’s health benefits without hitting on its role in the gut, or microbiome — an expansive community of bacteria, fungi and other organisms that live mostly in the large intestine and influence your overall health. “There’s more and more research coming out on how the gut is connected to everything,” Soans says — and there’s still so much we’re learning. What we do know is that fiber feeds the “good” bacteria, Zeratsky explains, which keeps them happy and allows them to flourish while simultaneously keeping harmful microbes in check. The byproducts that these good bacteria produce from feasting on fiber help with everything from digestion to mood to immune response. “I think we recognize the importance, more so now, that fiber plays in the regulation of what types of bacteria are present there,” Zeratsky says. Shah says the key is to eat a wide variety of foods that are high in fiber — aim for several different sources a day, from leafy vegetables to beans and whole grains. This will help improve the diversity, and “we want a variety of bacteria for good gut microbiome health,” Shah says. 4. Fiber supports your immune system The gut and the immune system are closely intertwined. In particular, the beneficial byproducts that some bacteria produce from fermenting fiber, called short-chain fatty acids, “have direct effects on the immune system,” Shah says, which helps explain their role in cancer risk reduction. “I joke, but I think it’s kind of true that fiber is the original immunotherapy,” Shah says. Some research suggests that diets high in fiber from fruits may reduce respiratory illness symptoms; other studies have linked a high-fiber diet to lower asthma risk. Fiber is even being studied as a possible treatment for long COVID symptoms, especially persisting gastrointestinal issues. 5. Fiber combats constipation The health benefit that most are familiar with is fiber’s role in keeping you regular, which can become increasingly difficult with advancing age. According to the National Institute on Aging, roughly one-third of people 60 and older experience occasional constipation. Because the body can’t digest fiber, it adds bulk to the stool, which helps move it through the digestive system more quickly. Some fibrous foods, like prunes and kiwis, are better than others at relieving constipation. Adding more fiber into your diet If you’re looking for more ways to add fiber to your diet, small changes can make a big difference. Top your morning toast or lunchtime sandwich with avocado, Zeratsky suggests — an often overlooked source of fiber. One medium avocado contains about 10 grams of fiber, according to The Nutrition Source at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. When baking, swap your white flour for whole-grain flours, Soans says, and your white pasta for an alternative, like chickpea and lentil pasta. A few other high-fiber foods that can help you boost your intake: PopcornCacao powder (skip the chocolate bar, and add it to a smoothie)Chia and flax seedsAlmondsPistachiosLentilsBarleyArtichokes Adding a fiber supplement — whether pill or powder — might seem like an easy way to pack in more fiber, but “it’s not the same” as getting fiber from food, Soans says. “The reason is because with food, the fiber is coming with all the other nutrients — vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytonutrients — all this other good stuff that works synergistically to improve our health,” she says. Still, some people who experience chronic constipation or who have dietary limitations may benefit from a supplement, Soans adds.

Symptoms can vary profoundly depending on which areas of the brain are affected By Marlene Cimons Updated April 29, 2025 Reviewed by Justin Miller, Ph.D. Comments En español Published January 17, 2024 / Updated April 29, 2025 PM Images / Getty Images When people talk about dementia, they often mean Alzheimer’s disease, the illness that robs memories and renders a person unable to function in daily life. To be sure, Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, or the loss of cognitive function. But it’s not the only one. There are several other types. These include Lewy body dementia along with Parkinson’s dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia — the same condition actor Bruce Willis has. Some people can suffer from a combination of these, a condition known as mixed dementia. These illnesses result from a progressive destruction of brain cells, which is why they are often referred to as “neurodegenerative diseases.” But their symptoms can be strikingly different. The hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, for example, include memory loss and language changes (e.g., trouble finding words). With frontotemporal dementia, language or behavior changes are the most prominent symptoms while memory remains relatively less affected. Alzheimer’s patients “might have trouble remembering to take their medication,” says Andrew Budson, M.D., chief of cognitive and behavioral neurology and director of the Center for Translational Cognitive Neuroscience at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System. But in frontotemporal dementia, memory is much less affected than in Alzheimer’s disease. So a patient may say, “﻿ ‘I don’t think I want to take my medicine, I’d rather watch TV,’﻿ ” Budson says. “The outcome is the same, but the presentation is different.” One note: It’s important to distinguish the diseases above from the numerous health conditions and medications that can cause memory loss. Many of these are often reversible. 5 types of dementia﻿ There are currently no cures for these types of dementia, but treatments can improve some symptoms and newer therapies are being tested to slow down disease progression. 1. Alzheimer’s disease. An estimated 7.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s today, making it the most common form of dementia. For most people, symptoms first appear in the mid-60s or later. About one-third of all people 85 and older may have Alzheimer's disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. The causes of this type of dementia are not fully understood, but it most likely involves abnormal buildup of misfolded proteins known as amyloid plaques that form in the spaces between nerve cells, and tangles of a different protein called tau. The tangles build up inside nerve cells, breaking down cell-to-cell communications as the disease progresses.﻿ AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits Alzheimer’s affects a person’s memory and eventually the ability to think, reason and perform even the simplest of tasks. Two regions of the brain, which are responsible for memory — the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus — the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus — are particularly vulnerable early in the disease. Later, areas in the cerebral cortex become impaired. Those areas are involved in language, reasoning and social behavior. 2. Lewy body dementia. Two types of dementia make up this category: dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). BBoth involve abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain. These so-called Lewy bodies produce changes in brain chemicals that can alter movement, thinking, behavior and mood. In both DLB and PDD, people develop movement problems and changes in memory, executive functioning (e.g., planning, organizing) and the ability to identify visual and spatial relationships among objects. Some patients can also experience vivid hallucinations, seeing things that aren’t there, which can be distressing and hard for people to talk about, for fear of severe mental illness. ﻿ For people with DLB, the cognitive changes and motor changes happen around the same time, but people with Parkinson’s disease may have movement problems for years before cognitive changes occur, if they develop at all. It’s difficult to predict. One risk factor for both Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease is REM sleep behavior disorder, in which a person physically acts out their dreams while sleeping. One of Budson’s patients, a war veteran with Lewy body dementia, had a dream he was back in a war zone engaged in battle. “His wife complained one time she was being strangled by him,” Budson recalls. “Normally when we sleep and have a dream, we are paralyzed, and that’s why we don’t act it out. But patients with Lewy body are not paralyzed. They might run in their sleep. Swim in their sleep. Fight in their sleep.”﻿ 3. Vascular dementia. About 10 percent of all dementia cases are vascular, caused by strokes or other problems with blood flow to the brain. The lack of blood flow robs the brain of oxygen and nutrients. High blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, diabetes and high cholesterol can increase risk for vascular dementia. Symptoms depend on where in the brain the blood flow is blocked. If a person has multiple strokes or ministrokes, symptoms can worsen. “People lose functions because they develop one stroke after another,” Budson says. “It can be ministrokes, big ones or both. The first time I saw my patient he’d had a stroke that left him unable to write. The next time I saw him, he was unable to calculate the tip in a restaurant. And then he had difficulty dressing himself.” 4. Frontotemporal dementia. Unlike Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia most often strikes younger adults, between the ages of 45 and 64. It results from nerve cell damage in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, as the name suggests. There are two primary kinds of frontotemporal dementia. In one form, symptoms show up as unusual behaviors, emotional issues﻿ —﻿ such as acting or saying things impulsively without regard to other people’s feelings﻿ —﻿ and difficulty communicating. ​ In the other, the temporal lobes on the side of the brain — the area responsible for speech and language — are affected, creating difficulties understanding and speaking. People forget the meaning of words. “One of my patients with language problems actually forgot what the words for different body parts were,” Budson says. “He didn’t know what a knee or elbow or foot were.” This patient had what is known as the semantic version of ﻿primary progressive aphasia. People with this rare form of dementia may behave impulsively or make reckless financial decisions. “I had a patient some years ago who bought lottery tickets every evening after work,” says Paul E. Schulz, M.D., director of the Neurocognitive Disorders Center at the UT Health Houston McGovern Medical School. “He didn’t pay the mortgage on the office building for a year. His whole garage was stuffed with tickets, barrels full of tickets, millions of tickets.” Others will eat almost anything, says Budson, recalling a patient who “ate an entire jar of mayonnaise and then a raw steak.” 5. Mixed dementia. Sometimes symptoms come from more than one type of dementia. When a person with Alzheimer’s, for example, suffers a stroke, vascular dementia can result. When more than one type of dementia exists, the disease may progress faster. People older than 80 are especially vulnerable to mixed dementia.

Try our new workout with 12 easy moves By Michele Wojciechowski, Updated December 13, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published January 11, 2022 / Updated December 13, 2023 Michal Venera A few years ago, I had a pain in my right thigh. I assumed I had pulled a muscle and soldiered on. Until, that is, it interfered with my playing the bass drum on my drum kit. That’s when I finally saw a physical therapist. Turns out, the pain wasn’t coming from my thigh. It was stemming from my hip area ﻿— more specifically, from my glutes. ﻿Only after many sessions with my ﻿physical therapist a﻿nd exercising at home﻿ was I back to pounding away on the skins pain-free﻿. While many people age 50 and older know they need to focus on their arms, legs and back when working out, they are most likely ignoring other parts of their bodies. You probably are﻿, too. “As we age, we may think we’re active and doing the things to keep us that way,” says Joe Palmer, ﻿a doctor of physical therapy, VP and co-owner of Active Life & Sports Physical Therapy in Maryland. Oftentimes, ﻿he says, when patients come ﻿to his clinics with pain in their lower extremities﻿, it’s because they aren’t keeping their hips strong. “Hip﻿ strengthening is where you get the most bang for your buck,” Palmer﻿ says. “People who walk slower typically have weaker hips﻿, and that impacts their balance.” He says this ﻿is also ﻿what’s happen﻿ing with folks ﻿who have trouble getting up from the floor or out of a chair without using their arms. Let’s Play Pickleball! Become a part of the country’s fastest growing sport. Learn the rules, tips for playing and ways to win. Plus, how to warm up, what to wear and where to play. Read more about the joy of pickleball When Palmer says “hips,” he’s talking about the gluteal muscles: ﻿the gluteus maximus, medi﻿us and minim﻿us. “When people have weakness, it’s really in those, the primary hip stabilizers,” he says. According to Palmer, people also often forget about their ﻿core. A strong core﻿, he says, helps you maintain your balance “as you are intentionally trying to reach for something or go outside your base of support﻿.” Pay attention to your knees You also need to ﻿be str﻿ong in other parts of ﻿your body if you want to keep active. In your knees, you need to maintain strength, but also flexibility and muscular balance, says Fred Cushner, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in ﻿New York City and﻿ chief medical officer for Canary Medical. ﻿ “The two main muscle groups to the knee are the quads and the hamstrings. So, when your quads get weak, you might have pain getting from a sitting to ﻿a standing position. You may have discomfort with stairs and problems kneeling,” Cushner explains. “With problems in the hamstrings, you get tightness in your hamstrings, but that can also give you some low back pain.” But you need to keep these muscles strong in the correct manner. “While lunges and squats might be great for your 18-year-old grandson, they’re not great when you have some arthritis﻿, because that puts a lot of force across the knee,” he says. “So it’s not only strengthening, but appropriate strengthening.” ﻿Cushner adds that with knees and other joints, maintaining flexibility is important because it helps prevent injury while also maintaining the balance of the joint. Keep ankles and feet strong ﻿Now ﻿that you’ve worked on your hips and knees, let’s move a little lower. “Strengthening ankles is very important in improving the stability of the ankle, as it relates to overall hip, knee and ankle stabilization, which can highly impact balance,” says Bruce M. Duchemin, a home care physical therapist with Granite VNA in New Hampshire ﻿with 46 years of experience ﻿in ﻿physical therapy. “An unstable ﻿ankle can result in loss of balance, twisting the ankle and causing injuries and/or falls.” It’s also crucial to strengthen the muscles in your feet. “Keeping your feet strong can prevent pain and improve your balance,” says Jasmine Marcus, ﻿a ﻿doctor of physical therapy at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, New York. Avoid a pain in the neck (or wrists) Believe it or not, neck or cervical exercises are essential “to maintain pain-free neck range of motion and strength﻿, which will translate into preventing the head from moving ahead of the cervical spine’s center of gravity,” says Duchemin. These exercises prevent “common aging issues such as a forward head posture, reversal of the cervical spine curve causing neck pain, and development of a kyphosis,” also referred to as a hunch﻿ back, says Duchemin, who says this will cause the head to go forward and the chin to rest on the chest wall rather than being held in a good, upright posture. “These alterations in the cervical spine will change the center of gravity of the upper body, causing the patient to develop balance impairments associated with posture﻿,” which may result in falls, he says. And don’t overlook your wrists. “It’s important to keep your wrists and your fingers moving, as a way to manage some arthritic symptoms,” Palmer says. This type of exercise is key ﻿to keeping your independence. “As people age from the 50s to the 60s and beyond into the 80s, the wrists are an important joint to strengthen as it relates to the overall function of the arm,” Duchemin says. “It helps take stress off the shoulder and elbow in the execution of overhead activities.” For example, having strong wrists can help you put things away more easily in an overhead cabinet or support your arms when you push down to get out of a chair. Remember ﻿the next time you head to a fitness center﻿ or gym ﻿— or your own living room ﻿— you need to exercise a lot more than simply the basics. Note: Always consult your physician, physical therapist, personal trainer and/or another health/fitness expert before beginning a new type of exercise or exercise program. Exercises to ﻿strengthen ﻿crucial ﻿muscles ﻿that ﻿are ﻿sometimes ﻿ignored Larry Sarjeant, a fitness professional who works with adults age 50 and older on strength and cross training, said it’s crucial that older adults continue to do exercises that increase strength and maintain mobility. “As we age, we lose muscle mass,” Sarjeant says. “The more strength you have, the greater your ability to maintain balance.” Sarjeant designed the following exercises to work the muscles described in this article. They are meant be done on a bed or workout table, so those who have trouble getting up and down from the floor can do them. He says it’s important to start with small movements and reps and build from there. “Fitness should be a lifelong endeavor. We don’t need to achieve everything today. You want to start off and see what your body can handle and then see how you feel tomorrow. If you are really sore, or let’s say your knees are bothering you, you might have to back off.” Here is Sarjeant’s workout designed to help strengthen hips, knees, quads, ankles, calves, neck and wrists — all muscles that are crucial for daily movement but sometimes neglected in training. Depending on your ability, start with eight to 12 repetitions of each of these exercises and build to more repetitions and repeated sets as you get stronger. If you can only do one or two repetitions, start with that. Small improvements over time make a difference. Talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise regime to make sure it’s safe for you.

However, these changes can sometimes signify serious eye conditions that can lead to vision loss or even blindness, as well as reveal potentially dangerous health issues unrelated to sight. Getting regular eye exams can help to preserve your sight and detect diseases early. At age 45, less than 1 percent of people are likely to have low vision, which means having impaired vision that may make everyday activities like reading and driving challenging and that cannot be fixed by standard means, including glasses, medication or eye surgery. By 75, that number jumps to nearly 5 percent, and then to 15 percent by the age of 85. But losing your vision with age doesn’t have to be a foregone conclusion. Detection of low vision and other potential eye issues through a dilated eye exam can be key to getting an early diagnosis and treatment. “Older age is a risk factor for various eye conditions, including dry eye disease, cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration,” says eye surgeon Jovi Boparai, M.D. , CEO of CorneaCare in Princeton, New Jersey. Eye exams can also help to diagnose conditions unrelated to sight — hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, aneurysms and even brain tumors — because doctors are able to directly see nerves and blood vessels in the eyes. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), problems found in the eye are often the first indicators of diseases that could be elsewhere in your body.

During an exam an optometrist or ophthalmologist looks at cornea, conjunctiva, eyelids, iris, lens, retina and optic nerve. Read more about eye parts and how your vision works, and take our quiz on eye anatomy. How often should you get your eyes checked? Recommendations for the frequency of eye exams for older adults vary slightly and depend on your age, overall health and risk factors for eye disease. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults get a complete eye examination at age 40 (earlier if you have an eye disease or risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or a family history of eye disease). After that exam, your eye care provider can tell you how often you should have your eyes checked in the future. If you are 65 or older, you should get your eyes checked every year or two, the group says.The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that people at low risk for eye problems get an exam at least every two years between the ages of 40 and 64 and annually at 65 or older.The National Institute on Aging has slightly different recommendations, advising that everyone over age 50 have an eye exam annually, or as recommended by their eye care provider, and every year or two after age 60. More frequent eye exams than those noted above may be needed for people with certain risk factors. These include people who: Wear contact lenses or glassesHave a family history of eye diseaseHave a history of eye surgery, an eye injury or previous eye damage from conditions such as strokes Are of Black, Native American or Hispanic descentAre overweight or obese (a body mass index [BMI] of 30 or more)Have health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, that can cause eye issues or vision loss “Diabetes is the number one cause of preventable vision loss in this country, and it's called diabetic retinopathy. If you have any sort of damage to your eyes from diabetes, you very well may need to be seen more frequently,” says Daniel Diamond, instructor of optometric sciences in ophthalmology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. More than 9 million people in the United States have diabetic retinopathy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It’s important to talk with your doctor or eye care professional to find out the best examination schedule for you. If you already have glasses or contact lenses, you’ll want to have your prescription checked, because even minor changes in sight can you at a higher risk for falls.

After getting a medical history, including a family history, what medications you take and whether you wear corrective lenses, your doctor may perform the following tests. 1. Eye chart test for visual acuity For this test, you will read an eye chart to decipher how well you can see from various distances. One eye will be covered while the other is tested. A phoropter test can help determine what type of corrective lens you need. Getty Images 2. Phoropter test During this test, your doctor will have you look at an eye chart through a phoropter, which contains different lenses and can help to determine the appropriate contact lenses or eyeglass prescription for you. 3. Pupil tests By shining a bright light into your eye, your doctor can see how your pupils respond to light. Normally pupils will respond by getting smaller. If they don’t, or if they react unequally, you could have an underlying problem with your eyes. 4. Peripheral (side) vision test A loss of vision at the sides of your eyes, which you may not even notice in your daily life, can be a symptom of glaucoma. This can be tested with a visual field test, where you look straight ahead at one fixed point and tell the doctor when you see light or an object off to the side. 5. Eye movement test (ocular motility) The ocular motility test evaluates your eyes’ movement. The eye care specialist will look to see if your eyes are aligned and if the muscles work properly. You may be asked to look straight ahead while the doctor moves an object in several directions and asks you to follow it with your eyes while keeping your head still. The purpose is to determine weakness or other problems in your eye muscles that could lead to double vision. A phoropter test can help determine what type of corrective lens you need. Getty Images A tonometry test is also known as an eye pressure test. Getty Images 6. Eye pressure test (tonometry) Tonometry, otherwise known as eye pressure testing, measures your intraocular eye pressure (IOP). The test could include a quick puff of air onto the eyeball or the application of a pressure-sensitive tip near your eye. Eye numbing drops may be used. Having elevated IOP could be a sign of glaucoma. 7. Slit- lamp exam (front of the eye exam) A slit-lamp microscope is used to light up the front portions of your eye, which include your eyelid, cornea, iris and lens. This test can help to diagnose cataracts and identify injuries to the cornea, among other conditions. 8. Dilated pupil exam (retina and optic nerve test) Your doctor may put dilating eye drops into your eye to widen your pupil during an eye exam. Shutterstock During your visit, the eye doctor will likely put dilating eye drops into your eye to widen your pupil, which is the black dot in the middle of your eye. This allows the doctor to examine your optic nerve and your retina, which is a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of your eyeball that converts images into electric signals and sends them to your brain through the optic nerve. “In addition to an exam, your eye doctor may leverage new technology such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) to objectively analyze the different layers of the retina and optic nerve,” says Boparai. This test can cost extra, approximately $45 in some cases, and is often not covered by insurance. “Your eye doctor may also use visual field testing to evaluate your peripheral and central vision. If you have a condition that requires photo documentation, your eye doctor may obtain images of the front of the eye or of the back of the eye using specialized cameras. If you have a corneal condition, your eye doctor may use corneal topography to evaluate the unique shape of your corneas,” Boparai says. Read more about 10 Diseases Eye Dilation Can Spot. 9. Brain and cognitive testing Eye symptoms can sometimes be an indicator of cognitive issues, according to the Cleveland Clinic. In certain circumstances, your doctor may do a cognitive assessment by making conversation with you to make sure that you know details about yourself and your environment. Additional eye tests include specialized imaging techniques that help to provide early detection of problems in the back of the eye, as well as on its surface and inside the eye.

If you are using insurance, your copay may range between $10 and $40. Medicaredoesn’t cover eye exams, glasses or contact lenses unless you have certain conditions like diabetes, age-related macular degeneration, or are at high risk for glaucoma. If you want to do the eye chart test at home, you can buy one online for $20.﻿ What happens after the eye exam? If your eye care professional finds that you need corrective lenses, they will provide a digital or paper copy of the prescription. The prescription could also include your pupillary distance, which is the distance between the pupils of your eyes. You need that number to buy glasses online. You may have to ask for the pupil measurement, as it’s not always routinely provided. Your doctor may also provide recommendations for treatment and follow-up testing for other eye conditions they detect. If your pupils are dilated during the exam, you may be sensitive to daylight and device screens for a few hours and could have trouble focusing on items close to your face. You may want to wear sunglasses or temporary shades immediately after the visit. Arranging transportation is a good idea if you are concerned about driving after eye dilation. Warning signs of eye problems Anytime you notice changes in your vision, it is a good idea to visit an eye specialist. These changes can include: Decreased vision, such as finding it harder to read fine print or textFading of color visionSquinting or eyestrainHeadaches at the end of the dayEye pain or prolonged itchingDrainage or redness of the eyeDouble visionFloaters (tiny specks that appear to float before your eyes)Circles (halos) around light sourcesFlashes of light When vision loss is an emergency According to the Cleveland Clinic, ﻿unexpected or sudden vision loss in one or both eyes (partial or total) is a medical emergency. In some situations, the vision loss can become permanent, and in others, the underlying condition causing the sudden vision loss can be deadly. Sudden vision loss can look like the following: Blurring or fadingDarkening/dimmingA black curtain or sheet covering part or all of your vision in one or both eyesBright flashes or lights that cover part or all of your vision Call 911 if you experience these sudden vision loss symptoms. Migraines can also cause temporary vision loss. It’s important to talk to your eye care specialist or health care provider to see if you need emergency care in that scenario, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Can I check my eyesight myself at home? A home vision test is not a substitute for an exam by a professional eye care provider and will not diagnose any underlying health conditions you may be facing. However, it can be a first step in learning more about your eye health. The AAO offers what’s known as a Snellen chart for adults along with instructions on setting up the test and determining the results. Other possible home tests include the Amsler grid test for macular degeneration. This can be used to check if lines on the grid look wavy or distorted, or if any of the areas of the grid appear to be missing. The American Macular Degeneration Foundation provides a printable grid with instructions. Smartphone apps are available that offer vision tests and even provide prescriptions, but they may require attaching an additional device to your phone. Your eye care provider may be able to offer more information on their accuracy. What does your eye color say about your health? Your eye color may signal a predisposition to certain medical conditions, such as skin or eye cancer. Additionally, some diseases, medications and traumas can make your eyes seem to change color. These changes can happen in the iris, which is the colored part of the eye, or in another part of your eye that makes the eye color appear to change.

Some of the early warning signs include shortness of breath, coughing up mucus and wheezing and chest tightness, according to the American Lung Association. At first these symptoms can be easy to overlook or mistake for another common ailment — especially during COVID-19 surges or cold and flu season. But doctors warn that they shouldn’t be ignored. “If symptoms are short-lived, then maybe it’s nothing. But if they go on, don’t just chalk it up to something like an infection. It may be something more serious,” says Jessica S. Wang Memoli, M.D., a pulmonologist and director of Bronchoscopy & Interventional Pulmonary at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. If you do have a lung disease like COPD, an early diagnosis means earlier access to treatments, which may forestall additional lung function loss. Here are three warning signs to pay attention to. 1. Shortness of breath While it’s true that lung function declines with age, meaning breathing may gradually become more difficult, sudden shortness of breath during routine activities is not normal. So if you notice that you’re out of breath out of the blue, that’s a sign you should see a doctor. “If you were able to walk up a couple flights of stairs a couple of weeks ago, and then today you just feel more winded, that could be a sign that maybe something else is going on,” Wang Memoli says. If your breathing is noisy — you’re wheezing — that’s another red flag. Also, pay attention to an overall low-energy feeling, which can be a warning sign of lung disease, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 2. A cough that won’t go away — and won’t get better It’s not uncommon for a routine respiratory infection to cause a cough that sticks around for a few weeks — maybe even longer. But if your cough prevails and doesn’t get better over time, “then it’s something to be a little bit more concerned about,” Wang Memoli says. The American Lung Association recommends getting checked out if you have a cough that lasts more than eight weeks. Also, see a doctor if you’re coughing up mucus or phlegm for more than a month. Coughing up blood is another sign that shouldn’t be ignored, says Gerard J. Criner, M.D., director of Temple Lung Center in Philadelphia. 3. Chest pain or tightness While often thought of as a cardiovascular issue, pain or tightness in the chest can be related to pulmonary complications, Wang Memoli says. A sharp stabbing pain that hits when you breathe in or cough could point to pneumonia. And chest tightness is a common symptom of COPD, which is when the airways become damaged (less air flows in and out), making it hard to breathe. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. Spotting symptoms early could improve treatment odds Many conditions that fall under the lung disease umbrella are treatable or manageable with medications and other therapies, Wang Memoli says. In some cases, like with lung cancer, the second most common cancer in the U.S., early detection “results in improvement in survival,” Criner says. Finding lung cancer early, when it’s more curable, can decrease mortality by up to 20 percent, research shows. And in other diseases, like COPD, which affects some 16 million Americans, “if you intercede and treat patients, they have a much better quality of life,” Criner adds. Treatment for COPD may include medicines like bronchodilators to relax the muscles around the airways and steroids to reduce inflammation. Some people with COPD may also receive oxygen therapy. During an evaluation, your doctor will likely ask about your work history and other possible exposures, since everything from air pollution to smoking can cause lung disease. “Someone who spent their lifetime working in construction, with or without good protection, is at risk for occupational lung disease,” says Jamie Garfield, M.D., a volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association and a professor of thoracic medicine and surgery at Temple Lung Center. “So if they develop the cough in their 60s … I would be suspicious for the beginning symptoms of an occupational lung disease,” Garfield adds. Your doctor may use a machine called a spirometer to measure how much air you can breathe in and out. This test is commonly used to help diagnose asthma and COPD. A chest X-ray can also help your doctor see what’s happening in the lungs. Lower your risk of lung disease You can do some things to lower your risk for developing lung diseases, health experts say. If you smoke, quit. Doing so is “very difficult,” Garfield acknowledges, but “your doctor has resources available to help.” And if you are 50 or older and are, or used to be, a heavy smoker, talk to your doctor about getting screened for lung cancer, Wang Memoli says. Screening recommendations from the American Cancer Society recently changed to include adults ages 50 to 80 (ACS) who currently smoke or used to smoke the equivalent of one pack a day for 20 years, no matter how long ago they quit. Also, test for radon (a colorless, odorless gas known to cause lung cancer) in your home, and steer clear of asbestos, dust and chemical fumes. And since some lung diseases are caused by germs, be sure to keep up with handwashing and stay up-to-date on your vaccines, including shots for flu and COVID-19. Health officials also recommend that people 65 and older get a pneumococcal vaccine, which can help protect against pneumonia. The take-home message, Wang Memoli says, is that “if [your symptoms] are significant enough where they’re bothering you, don’t ignore them.” Women and lung disease The number of women in the U.S. diagnosed with lung disease, and dying from lung disease, is on the rise. Here’s what you need to know: Three of the most common lung diseases in women are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. In every year since 2000, more women than men have died from COPD. In 2018, chronic lower respiratory disease, primarily COPD, was the fourth leading cause of death among women. The percentage of women, especially young women, with asthma is rising in the U.S., and the reason is unclear to researchers.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/chronic-conditions-after-50/,"7 Common Health Problems That Can Strike After 50 Some chronic conditions tend to start cropping up in midlife. Here’s what to do about them By Rachel Nania, Updated June 16, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published May 18, 2021 / Updated June 16, 2023 BSIP / UIG / Getty Images There’s a lot to celebrate when you hit the big five-oh. Discounts start to kick in, investments begin to mature and — how does the saying go? — with age comes wisdom.​​​ But for all the money saved and knowledge earned, there’s a small price to pay: It’s time to really tune in to your health.​ ​“What we see is that some chronic health conditions are frequently diagnosed starting at age 50,” says Renuka Tipirneni, M.D., an internist and assistant professor in the Division of General Medicine at the University of Michigan.​​ The good news is that many of the conditions that creep up in midlife can be managed. And if they’re caught early and treated promptly, you can “prevent complications that are more serious,” Tipirneni explains.​ ​Here's what you need to look out for after you turn 50.﻿​ ​1. High blood pressure﻿​ A common condition health care providers see among patients in their 50s is high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.﻿​ ​One reason high blood pressure is so prevalent in this age group is that the vascular system changes as we age. Arteries become less elastic, and the pressure inside them builds. The extra weight and stress that often accompany middle age can also contribute to creeping numbers.﻿​ ​The good news: High blood pressure is manageable with medication and lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise. Because the condition often lacks symptoms, it’s easy to miss. In fact, nearly 1 in 3 adults with high blood pressure don’t know they have it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.﻿​ ​That’s why Tipirneni recommends getting your blood pressure checked “more regularly” — at least every year — once you hit 50.﻿​ ​If you have a blood pressure cuff (they cost about $30), you can check it yourself. And pharmacies and health fairs often offer blood pressure checks for free, Tipirneni points out. Of course, your health care provider can take it for you.﻿​ Warning Signs of Heart Disease High blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes are three leading risk factors for heart disease, which is the number one cause of death in the U.S. Do you know the warning signs? “Most people worry about chest pain,” says Renuka Tipirneni, M.D., an internist and assistant professor in the Division of General Medicine at the University of Michigan. Pain in the chest is an indication that something could be wrong, but there are other symptoms, including: Unexplained back pain that happens when you exercise​ Pain in the neck, jaw or throat​ Pain in the upper abdomen​ Shortness of breath​ Nausea, vomiting or fatigue​ Dizziness​ Heart palpitations If you experience any of these symptoms and are at risk for heart disease, it’s important to get “evaluated emergently,” Tipirneni says.​﻿ Source: Renuka Tipirneni, M.D./CDC﻿ ​What you want to see is a reading at or below 120/80, which is considered normal by the American Heart Association. Anything over 130 on that top number (the systolic reading) is considered high and warrants a conversation with your doctor about possible treatments.​﻿​ 2. High cholesterol ﻿ Another contributor to heart disease is high cholesterol, which can build up on the inside of the blood vessels over time and form plaque that slows or blocks blood flow. This plaque can also break loose and cause a blood clot — even a heart attack or stroke.﻿​ ​As with high blood pressure, your risk for developing high cholesterol increases with age. It also comes with no symptoms or warning signs, which is why it’s important to check your numbers regularly throughout midlife with a routine blood test that can be done at the doctor’s office. Diet and exercise can help lower cholesterol, as can medication.﻿​ Warning Signs of Heart Disease High blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes are three leading risk factors for heart disease, which is the number one cause of death in the U.S. Do you know the warning signs? “Most people worry about chest pain,” says Renuka Tipirneni, M.D., an internist and assistant professor in the Division of General Medicine at the University of Michigan.

Diabetes ﻿ While you’re getting your blood checked for cholesterol, your health care provider may also screen you for diabetes — another common condition that creeps up in your 50s and can wreak havoc on your health. More than 37 million Americans have diabetes — the vast majority have type 2 diabetes — and those in middle age are most at risk, according to the CDC.﻿ An additional 96 million Americans have prediabetes, or higher than normal blood sugar. ﻿​ ​Diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes, including a healthy diet and physical activity. “Sometimes we need to add some medications as well” to help control blood sugar (glucose) levels, says Kate Lorig, professor emeritus at the Stanford University School of Medicine and a partner at the Self-Management Resource Center.﻿​ ​As with high blood pressure and cholesterol, the warning signs of diabetes are often silent, which is why it’s important to get screened. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to a host of health conditions, including kidney disease, vision loss and heart disease.﻿﻿ ​4. Arthritis ﻿ One condition that pops up in your 50s but is regularly overlooked or dismissed is arthritis — especially osteoarthritis, which Tipirneni refers to as “the wear-and-tear-type of arthritis” that occurs when the joint cartilage between bones is damaged or breaks down.﻿​ ​“It can be very aggravating even younger than age 50, but especially over age 50, we see pain associated with that is coming up more and more,” she says.﻿​ ​If you notice joint pain or stiffness from daily activity, talk to your health care provider. You’ll want to make sure it’s not rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease.﻿​ ​Treatment for osteoarthritis runs the gamut. Increasing physical activity can help prevent further pain or disability, Tipirneni says. Your health care provider may also recommend over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers to alleviate discomfort.﻿​ ​5. Osteoporosis﻿ Women in particular need to pay attention to their bone health once they hit 50 — that’s when osteoporosis, or the weakening of the bones, becomes most common. In fact, almost 20 percent of women 50 and older have osteoporosis, the CDC says.﻿​ ​That’s because one of the risk factors for osteoporosis is being postmenopausal, explains Lucy McBride, M.D., a Washington, D.C.-based internist. “When you stop making estrogen, your bone density typically goes down,” she says. The average age for menopause among women in the U.S. is 51, according to the Mayo Clinic.﻿​ ​Weight-bearing exercises — walking and upper-body strength training, for example — can help reduce your risk for developing osteoporosis. So can paying attention to your calcium intake and vitamin D levels, both of which are important to bone health.﻿ ​6. Cancer﻿​ Because advancing age is the biggest risk factor for cancer, keeping up with routine screenings becomes important in your 50s.﻿​ ​Women in this age group should get a regular mammogram to screen for breast cancer — the American Cancer Society recommends an annual mammogram; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force calls for one every two years — and men should talk to their health care providers about prostate cancer screenings. ﻿Colon cancer screenings also become more regular for both men and women.﻿​ ​7. Anxiety/depression﻿ Whether it’s teenagers, work or aging parents (or all of the above) that keep you busy in midlife, chances are you’re stressed. And all that stress can take a toll on your mental health, which in turn affects your physical health.​﻿​ “Because at the end of the day, your blood pressure, your weight, your cholesterol, your cancer risk — all those biometric [measurements] are rooted in your behaviors. And those behaviors are rooted in your emotional health,” McBride says.﻿​ ​About 20 percent of people age 55 or older experience some type of mental health concern, according to the CDC, and anxiety and depression are among the most common. ​﻿​ McBride’s advice? “You really need to make sure you’re bringing your whole self to the doctor” and talking to your health care provider about your stress levels and your relationship with food and alcohol, she says.﻿​ ​“Your brain is just like any other organ. We have heart health, we have breast health, we have skin health, we have kidney health. We also have mental health. It needs to be addressed,” McBride adds.﻿​ ​Mind your immune system﻿​ Another thing to bring up with your health care provider once you turn 50 is immunizations.﻿​ ​“Vaccines become much more important, because at this age group, our immune systems start to wane a little bit, and so you’re more at risk for infections,” Tipirneni says.​﻿​ In addition to the annual flu shot, your provider may suggest a shot that prevents pneumonia. There’s also a vaccine recommended for adults 50 and older to prevent shingles and the complications from the disease, and soon there could be one for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). ﻿ Don’t forget about your COVID-19 boosters. Staying up-to-date on coronavirus vaccines greatly reduces your risk of complications from an infection. ​﻿​ What’s Good for the Heart Is Good for the Brain Keeping your numbers in check — we’re talking blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight — is good for the heart, and it’s also important for the brain. Studies have found that high blood pressure in midlife can increase your risk of developing dementia later in life. Diabetes has also been linked to an increased risk of dementia, and both increase a person’s risk of stroke, sometimes called a “brain attack.” ﻿ A few other habits tha﻿t can help protect your brain health as you age: ﻿ Stay physically active. ﻿ Eat a healthy diet. ﻿ Don’t start smoking, and if you do smoke, quit. ﻿ Get symptoms of sleep apnea tested and treated. ﻿ Take the time and steps to manage your stress effectively.﻿ Source: CDC/ Global Council on Brain Health ﻿ Editor’s Note: This story, originally published May 18, 2021, has been updated to reflect new information.

So if you’re on the thin side, should you consider plumping up? Not necessarily. If you come from a naturally thin family or have consistently had a low body mass index (BMI), a lighter-than-average weight may not be a problem. “Sometimes people have a low BMI but they’re perfectly healthy,” says Allison Miner, a professor of nutrition and dietetics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. (A BMI less than 18.5 is considered underweight.) Some research has found that having a bit of extra weight as you age may even be good for you. Some studies have found people with higher BMIs after 60 may have a lower dementia risk than those who were underweight or have a normal weight — though it might be because people lose weight as dementia begins to take hold. Having a healthy weight seems to be important for bone strength as well. Being underweight is a risk factor for osteoporosis and increases risk of fractures. (Obesity has been associated with risk for fractures in some cases, so striving for a healthy weight is best.) Calculate Your BMI Try AARP’s Body Mass Index Calculator and determine your healthy weight. Unintentionally shedding pounds due to things like illness, depression or a medication that steals your appetite can spell danger in your older years. “Unhealthy weight loss can lead to a state called sarcopenia, which is when you’ve lost so much muscle mass that you don’t have enough for healthy function,” says Naomi Parrella, M.D., chief of lifestyle medicine at Rush University System for Health in Chicago. Trying to gain weight for health reasons sound like an enviable challenge for much of the country but, experts say, putting on pounds can be just as difficult as taking them off. The challenge is making sure that the weight you’re putting on is made up of more muscle than fat. The good news: “The human body is designed to heal and thrive no matter how old you are,” Parrella says. When it comes to losing weight, men typically have it easier since they have more lean muscle mass than women. Plus they tend to drop weight faster because they have more pounds to lose compared to women. Meanwhile, women have an easier time gaining weight. As people age, maintaining a healthy weight can become a challenge—but not always in the way you might expect. While it’s often easier for women to gain weight, men generally have an advantage when it comes to losing it due to their higher lean muscle mass. They also tend to drop pounds more quickly because they typically start with more weight to lose. However, for both men and women, the real concern with aging isn’t just weight management—it’s the gradual loss of muscle mass that naturally occurs over time. Quick tips for gaining healthy weight Small changes to your meals and snacks can make a big difference, reccommends Rachel Gargano, chief registered dietitian at Live it Up and a board-certified nutritionist in sports dietetics and breastfeeding. Gaining weight in a healthy way means focusing on nutrient-dense foods that provide extra calories without making you feel overly full. Here is her expert advice: Drizzle extra oil or butter on your meals—since they're packed with calories but don’t take up much space, it’s an easy way to get more in without feeling too full.Make a PB&J on whole wheat bread, cut it into four pieces, and snack on one throughout the day. Small bites add up!Blend up a smoothie for a snack. Use whole milk, nut butter, banana, and frozen fruit or baby spinach for extra nutrients and fiber. Want even more calories? Toss in a little olive.Sprinkle seeds, nuts, or avocado on meals and snacks to sneak in extra calories without much effort.Don’t skip snacks! Go for high-calorie options like nut or seed butters, whole nuts, avocado, milk or reduced-fat Greek yogurt—make sure to avoid saturated fats which can raise cholestoral. Here’s 10 more strategies to help you put on healthy weight: 1. Talk to your doctor Before focusing on gaining weight, it’s worth asking—why was it lost in the first place? Could it be from medication side effects, dental issues like poorly fitting dentures, a recent illness or hospital stay, or even changes in mood like depression? Calculate Your BMI Try AARP’s Body Mass Index Calculator and determine your healthy weight. If you’re recovering from an illness like cancer, ask your doctor if there are any limitations or considerations you should be aware of as you regain the weight. Likewise, if you’re too blue to feel like eating, seek mental health treatment. pamela_d_mcadams / Getty Images Snack break No-Bake Peanut Butter Balls 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter, store-bought or homemade 1½ cups oats, old fashioned 1/2 cup finely chopped or powdered nuts (any type) 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/3 cup dried cranberries or raisins 1 TB vanilla extract 1 tsp flax or chia seeds Combine the ingredients, adjusting the amount of peanut butter to ensure a firm texture that is not too sticky. Smooth peanut butter provides more calories than chunky peanut butter because the body is more efficient in digesting smooth peanut butter. Roll into tablespoon-size balls and place on parchment paper. Cover and refrigerate. —Alison Miner 2. Focus on gaining muscle mass When you are increasing the number on the scale, good nutrition and strength training should go hand in hand, says David Creel, director of exercise physiology at the Bariatric & Metabolic Institute at Cleveland Clinic. Strong muscles are key to doing the things you want to as you age and avoiding frailty. “When we’re talking about loss of muscle, we’re concerned about function, like being able to carry your groceries,” Creel says. That’s where strength training comes in. You don’t have to work out at the gym or with a trainer, though if you’re new to this type of exercise, a few sessions can be beneficial to learn the proper form. You can get a decent workout at home using small weights or resistance bands, or just lift household objects (soup cans, milk jugs). Do push-ups against a wall using gravity and your body as the weight, squats while holding onto a counter, and crunches for your core. Aim to work out two days per week, but not on consecutive days, Creel advises. To get started, check out workout videos for simple strength training exercises on our﻿ Staying Fit page. ﻿ 3. Eat more often For most healthy adults, three balanced meals a day about five hours apart is the ideal meal schedule, Miner says. If you want to gain weight naturally, though, you need to increase meal frequency. Instead of your typical three meals, add a hearty snack three hours after breakfast and lunch and another one before bed. 4. Increase protein intake To gain muscle mass instead of fat, you need high protein foods—and plenty of it. “As we get older, our body needs to take in a little bit more protein to stimulate muscle growth and for muscle maintenance,” Parrella says. It’s also necessary for strength training, Creel says. “You want to make sure that you’ve got the resources to put on the weight as muscle,” he says. The general recommendation is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (about 3.6 grams per 10 pounds). But “we’re finding that it’s better to get more like 1.2 or 1.3 grams per kilogram in someone who is trying to gain weight,” Creel says. People absorb protein less effectively as they age, so it’s important to spread your intake throughout the day. A good rule of thumb is to consume 25 to 50 grams of protein, three or four times a day, or every time you eat. “Otherwise, you can’t absorb enough protein at a time to maintain your muscle mass,” Parrella says. In addition to animal protein like chicken, beef and fish, consider soy products like tofu and edamame. You can also get quality protein from dairy products and nuts and by combining legumes with grains — amaranth and quinoa are particularly high in protein. And mix whey protein powder with smoothies, or drink packaged whey protein shakes. pamela_d_mcadams / Getty Images Snack break No-Bake Peanut Butter Balls 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter, store-bought or homemade 1½ cups oats, old fashioned 1/2 cup finely chopped or powdered nuts (any type) 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/3 cup dried cranberries or raisins 1 TB vanilla extract 1 tsp flax or chia seeds Combine the ingredients, adjusting the amount of peanut butter to ensure a firm texture that is not too sticky. Smooth peanut butter provides more calories than chunky peanut butter because the body is more efficient in digesting smooth peanut butter. Roll into tablespoon-size balls and place on parchment paper. Cover and refrigerate. —Alison Miner 5. Have a large breakfast People tend to be hungry when they wake up in the morning, so use this to your advantage and eat a full breakfast. “That’s when you really want to deliver the calories,” says Miner. “Eating more calories when you’re hungry is really the key.” Appetite wanes in the evening, so you can eat less then. 6. Eat more calories and fat Even if they know they should gain weight, many people are afraid to add fat to their diets, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, dietitian and author of Read It Before You Eat It: Taking You From Label to Table. “Fats like almonds, avocado, nut butters, and olive and avocado oils are great ways to get healthy fat in your diet, get concentrated calories, but not have a negative impact on your health.” Miner suggests cooking rice and oatmeal with milk, even evaporated milk, to add calories. And use coconut milk as a base in stews and curries. Feel free to enjoy whole-fat yogurt. “The latest evidence on the full-fat yogurt and even cheese, believe it or not, is that they do not increase blood cholesterol levels,” Miner says. 7. Eat energy-dense meals “A meal with a salad, a main dish and different sides is a lot of food to eat for someone who may not be used to eating that much,” Taub-Dix says. “And a big salad before a meal could be too filling. You want to make the meal more concentrated. The goal is less volume of food.” One-dish meals that combine vegetables, legumes, and chicken or fish (think: stews and soups) are a good option, Taub-Dix says. If you really want a salad, make it count: Include beans, nuts, avocados and dressing made with healthy oils like olive oil — nothing fat-free.

But make sure not do go over the reccommended daily limit of saturated fat, about 13 grams a day is the maximum you want to consume, according to the American Heart Association. 1/3 cup of finely chopped walnuts 1 banana or 1 cup of blueberries or strawberries (fresh or frozen) 1 cup chopped fresh baby spinach or ½ cup shredded carrots 1/3 cup of orange or apple juice 1 TB chia or flax seeds 2 TB whey protein powder (substitute pea protein powder, if vegan) Put ingredients in a blender, adjusting the amount of each ingredient to suit your taste. Blend on high for 1½ minutes. Drink between meals or as a meal substitute. —Alison Miner 8. Take your time Just as people should lose weight gradually, making behavioral changes that will stick, you should take a measured approach to healthy weight gain. “Adding 300 to 500 calories a day is a good place to start,” Creel says. That should allow you to gain about a half pound to ﻿a pound a week. ﻿ 9. Drink your calories Downing a lot of high-calorie beverages is one of the ways that people gain weight, so it’s the natural strategy for adding heft to your frame, Creel says. Instead of plain water, drink milk or 100 percent juice, he says. Smoothies are the perfect choice. “The reason we use them for weight gain is because the body doesn’t have to do anything to break it down,” Miner says. “So all the calories that you’re taking in will be absorbed.” You can even add whole or ground nuts to the mix. “The body is not efficient in breaking nuts down,” Miner says. “If I were to give someone a half cup of nuts to eat, they might only absorb a half to three-quarters of the calories as if they were blended into a drink.” Start with an instant breakfast drink or protein powder and add nuts and whole milk or almond milk. Then experiment with Greek yogurt, 100 percent juices, fruit and nut butters. 10. Stimulate your appetite “It’s really hard to force yourself to eat when you’re not hungry,” says Miner. And older people tend to have a lower appetite to start with. Solution? If a prescribed medication is wrecking your appetite, ask your doctor if there’s a substitute and troubleshoot other medical issues that might be robbing your appetite. You can also ask a doctor about medications that increase hunger, such as megestrol acetate, oxandrolone or dronabinol. Food should also seem more appealing after exercise, Creel says. In addition to resistance training, try some light cardio in the pool, he advises. “There’s evidence that swimming, especially in cold water, may stimulate appetite more than exercise on dry land, as your body has to generate more heat,” he says. “It’s also a great activity for older adults who might have some limitations as well.” Anna_Shepulova / Getty Images Smoothie Time High-Calorie/High-Protein Smoothie 1 cup of whole cow’s milk or whole milk yogurt (substitute coconut milk, if vegan).

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/stress-ages-immune-system/,"Stress May Prematurely Age Your Immune System Study suggests simple steps you can take to reduce the damage The Good Brigade By Peter Urban, AARP En español Published June 22, 2022 You likely already know this: Stress is bad for your health. And for people of advanced age, it appears to speed up the natural aging process of the immune system, resulting in too-tired white blood cells that aren’t up to the fight. And this increases the risk of cancer, heart disease and infectious illnesses such as COVID-19, according to a study appearing in PNAS (formerly called the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). As the study’s authors explain, “We found that exposure to social stress was associated with T cell distributions indicative of accelerated immune aging.” What to do Aside from trying to limit stress in your life, the researchers suggest a nutritious diet and exercise, to help maintain healthy T cell development. A gland called the thymus, which sits in front of and above the heart, serves as an incubator for T cells, but as we age, the thymus becomes fatty and doesn’t produce as many immune cells. Previous research has discovered that a healthy diet and exercise may slow down that aging shift. What’s more, the researchers who conducted the current study found that the connection between stress and accelerated immune aging was not as strong when they controlled for factors such as poor diet and infrequent exercise. “What this means is, people who experience more stress tend to have poorer diet and exercise habits, partly explaining why they have more accelerated immune aging,” lead study author Eric Klopack, a Ph.D. scholar in the University of Southern California’s Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, said in a statement. The researchers also suggest getting vaccinated against cytomegalovirus (CMV). People infected with this common virus are typically asymptomatic, but studies have shown it can accelerate immune aging. The researchers discovered that the connection between stress and accelerated immune aging was not as strong when they controlled for CMV positivity. “Widespread CMV vaccination could be a relatively simple and potentially powerful intervention that could reduce the immune aging effects of stress,” the researchers said. What the study did Relying on data collected through the University of Michigan’s Health and Retirement Study, the researchers created a national sample of 5,744 adults over 50 who had answered a questionnaire designed to assess their experiences with “social stress” — including stressful life events, chronic stress, everyday discrimination and lifetime discrimination. Through blood samples taken from the participants, the researchers looked specifically at T cells (which play an important role in the body’s immune response) to see if they could find a connection between exposure to stress and a weakening immune system. The study analysis found just that — a broad range of immune-system aging among subjects of similar chronological age, with stress exposure appearing to be a factor. Participants who experienced higher levels﻿ of lifetime discrimination and chronic stress had lower levels of naive T cells (the body’s immune sentinels) circulating in their bloodstream and higher levels of mature T cells that have spotted pathogens in the body. “As the world’s population of older adults increases, understanding disparities in age-related health is essential. Age-related changes in the immune system play a critical role in declining health,” Klopack said. “This study helps clarify mechanisms involved in accelerated immune aging.”﻿﻿ Peter Urban is a contributing writer and editor who focuses on health news.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-presbyopia/#comments_widget_id,"Presbyopia Symptoms and Treatments What you need to know about age-related vision changes By Lauren Evoy Davis, AARP Comments En español Published May 08, 2025 Liam Eisenberg If you’re starting to hold restaurant menus further and further away to see better, you are likely experiencing presbyopia. It’s not a disease, but a natural sign of aging, like graying hair. Presbyopia, with Greek and Latin origins roughly meaning “old eye” is the medical term for your vision becoming less clear over time, affecting approximately 128 million people in the United States, according to the American Optometric Association (AOA). It typically starts when people are in their 40s, when they start notice they're having a harder time clearly seeing things close up. Just as muscles anywhere else in your body often become less flexible as you get older, this happens as the eye muscles become less flexible, says Vicky Wong, president of the American Optometric Association. Symptoms and conditions The main symptom of presbyopia is the inability to see things clearly up close. Other symptoms or conditions include: Blurry eyesDouble visionEye strainHeadachesTrouble focusing Those with diabetes, heart disease, or multiple sclerosis might have an earlier onset of presbyopia. Some medications, such as diuretics, antidepressants, and antihistamines, may also bring on premature presbyopia. Antidepressants can also cause dry eyes and blurred vision. In addition, menopause brings on changes and dryness of the eyes. Diagnosis At an eye appointment, the doctor will put drops in your eyes to dilate them. The doctor will perform and eye exam to determine if you have presbyopia or another eye condition. If you are between the ages of 55 and 64 you should have an eye examevery one to three years, according to AOA. After age 65, you should visit your eye doctor annually. Treatments If untreated, presbyopia can inhibit your quality of life, and there are many options to help correct your vision. Reading glasses It’s a good idea to schedule a yearly eye exam to understand both your vision changes and your overall eye health. Your eye doctor might recommend that you get reading glasses. But this doesn’t mean you need to buy an expensive pair. You may be able to simply buy readers, which increase the close-up fonts and images. If your eyes have very different prescriptions, however, you may need prescription glasses, but when considering cost, you don’t have to buy them from the storefront at your eye doctor. Instead, ask for your prescription so that you can use it online or at discount stores. Contact lenses Contact lenses can be a good option for people who don’t want to keep glasses on hand. Lens types include: Bifocal: The lens has a line between the up-close and distance prescriptionsDiffractive: The lens focuses light by diffraction, which is bending light to two focal pointsMonofocal: One lens corrects one eye for distance, and the other lens for up closeMultifocal: Also called simultaneous vision, this lens has prescriptions for both up close and distance, but without the distinctive line of bifocals. You can choose lenses that you change daily or once per month. Daily lenses cost between $20 to $40 for a 30-day pack. Costs for monthly lenses range from $40 to $120 for lenses, but you can get them at a discounted bulk rate at big box stores. Many vision insurance plans cover eye exams and contact lenses, but may not cover them in full. Eye drops In 2021 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vuity﻿, prescription eye drops to treat presbyopia. You use them once daily, you can expect to get six to eight hours of clearer vision, according to Wong. “I have some patients that will use it just on the weekends, when they're out and about. If they're running errands or going to a kid's game, so that they don't have to keep bringing around their glasses,” says Wong. The drops are a low dose of a medication that makes the pupils smaller and increases the focal range, similar to a camera’s aperture, a fancy word for “opening,” according to Lisa Park, an ophthalmologist and associate professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. However, Park says the drops are not without risks, including, in rare cases, retinal detachment. You can expect to pay between $80 and $100. Insurance companies do not generally cover eye drops. Types of surgery There are several surgical options available, which greatly depend on each person’s vision needs, according to Shahzad I. Mian, M.D., professor of ophthalmology and director of W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Cataract surgery Mian says surgery to correct cataracts, when an aging eye lens becomes cloudy and hinders vision, can also correct presbyopia. This involves removing the lens and replacing it with a plastic lens. It creates monovision, which means one eye is corrected for up close and the other eye is corrected for distance. It may take some time for your brain to adjust. “People who have cataracts also have issues with their reading vision as well, but cataracts tend to become functionally visually significant more when you're in your 60s or older, on average,” Mian says. LASIK LASIK, short for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, is another option. LASIK surgery involves an ultraviolet laser to reshape the curvature of the cornea, the clear covering of the eye that refracts light. This procedure is also very quick and can create multifocal, bifocal, or other types of vision corrections. Side effects can include temporary fuzzy vision, dry eye or a halo effect. Be proactive with your eye health “Don’t ignore eye strain,” says Wong. With more and more people working from small screens on laptops and their smartphones, eye strain can worsen. If you’re struggling with eye strain or need to “reset” your eyes often, like every 15 minutes, it’s time to see an eye doctor.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/do-you-need-rsv-vaccine/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by Do You Need to Get the RSV Vaccine? Age recommendations for shots have been updated for the 2024-2025 cold and flu season By Rachel Nania, Updated September 09, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 03, 2024 / Updated September 09, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Getty Images(2)) Last year was the first time older adults had the opportunity to get a vaccine that can help prevent complications from RSV, a common virus that circulates during cold and flu season. RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus, typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but the illness can turn severe in older people and infants. Two vaccines for older adults were approved in 2023, and a third was cleared this year. But not many people rushed out to get the shot once it became available. An estimated 24.4 percent of adults ages 60-plus rolled up their sleeves for the RSV vaccine during the 2023-2024 season, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Vaccine fatigue stemming from multiple rounds of COVID-19 shots may have contributed to the low uptake, says Kathleen Linder, M.D., a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases at Michigan Medicine. “I also think that people don’t really appreciate how severe RSV illness can be,” Linder adds. “You hear about something like RSV and you think, ‘Oh, it’s a cold virus. If I have a cold, I’ll go on about my life.’ But the reality is, particularly in older people and in people who are immunocompromised, an RSV illness can be very severe.” As many as 160,000 adults ages 65 and older are hospitalized with RSV each year in the U.S., according to the CDC, and up to 10,000 older adults die from an infection. “That is not insignificant,” says Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. Here’s what you should know about the RSV vaccine for the 2024-2025 season. Video: CDC Director Explains Why Older Adults Should Protect Against RSV Who should get the RSV vaccine? The CDC recently streamlined its RSV vaccine guidelines and adjusted the age range for older adults who should get the shot. For this season, the CDC says everyone 75 and older should get the vaccine; so should people ages 60 to 74 who live in nursing homes or have certain chronic health issues, like lung or heart disease, that put them at higher risk for severe illness. People ages 50 to 59 were not included in the recommendations. In 2023, the official advice was to talk to your doctor about getting an RSV vaccine if you were 60 or older. ﻿ The change was made in part to simplify the recommendations and provide clarity on who benefits most from the vaccine, explains Amadea Britton, M.D., an RSV expert and medical officer at the CDC. “We now have a year of data from the first-ever RSV vaccines — we had millions of people get them — and we saw that they were really effective at preventing older adults from ending up in the hospital,” Britton says. “And that’s, I think, a really strong reason to go out and get vaccinated.” Video: CDC Director Explains Why Older Adults Should Protect Against RSV A study published Sept. 4, 2024 in JAMA found that the vaccine was 75 percent effective in preventing hospitalization in its first season. What if you got the vaccine last year? Unlike the COVID-19 and flu vaccines, which have updated formulations this fall, protection from the RSV vaccine is longer lasting. So if you got the shot last year, you can sit this year out, Britton says. According to the CDC, we know so far that the vaccine’s durability lasts for at least two winter seasons, but more data is needed to determine how long that protection will continue. ﻿ Researchers and public health officials are monitoring for signs of waning immunity in clinical trial participants, who are a few years out from their vaccines. “There’s definitely a possibility that this may be a vaccine that we recommend you get more than once in your lifetime,” Britton says. “But not yet.” Which vaccine should you get? Older adults have three options for the RSV vaccine — one from Modern﻿a, mResvia (an mRNA vaccine), one from GSK, Arexvy, and another from Pfizer, Abrysvo. If you’re wondering which you should get, Britton’s advice is to get what’s available at your pharmacy or clinic. “We don’t have any preferential recommendation. Whatever is available is great, it will protect you from RSV,” she says. And in clinical trials, “all of them were shown to be safe and effective,” Britton adds. What are the side effects? The RSV vaccine is “a pretty well tolerated vaccine, overall,” Linder says. Some people may experience temporary side effects, like injection site pain, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, joint stiffness/pain and nausea. These symptoms are generally a sign that the body is mounting an immune response, doctors say. Serious side effects from the vaccine are uncommon, but federal researchers found that a small share of people who were vaccinated with Arexvy and Abrysvo went on to develop a rare neurological disorder known as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS can cause numbness, weakness or even paralysis. Researchers, however, have noted that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk. Can you get the RSV vaccine with your flu and COVID-19 shots? If you’re planning on getting the RSV vaccine this year, and also the annual flu and updated COVID-19 vaccines, know that you don’t need to make separate trips to the clinic or pharmacy. It’s safe to get them all at once, the CDC says. There is a possibility you could experience higher rates of common side effects if you get all three at once, Britton says. “But we’ve seen that a lot of people still prefer to do it, just for convenience.” Want to get the vaccines at different visits? When it comes to scheduling those shots, you don’t need to wait a specific amount of time between the appointments, the CDC says. How much does it cost? The RSV vaccine is available to Medicare beneficiaries at no cost under Medicare’s prescription drug plan, known as Part D. And private health plans are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC in the year after they are approved, but some may cover them in the current plan year. ﻿It’s always a good idea to check with your insurance provider to make sure the vaccine is included in the current plan year and use an in-network provider to avoid out-of-network charges. Out of pocket, the RSV vaccine can cost roughly $300. Are there other ways to protect yourself from RSV? If you’re not eligible for the RSV vaccine but still want to avoid getting sick from the virus, there are some things you can do to lower the likelihood of catching it. Any kind of measures that you would take to protect yourself from flu and COVID-19 also work against RSV, Linder says. “So avoiding people who are sick, wearing a mask if you’re going to be in an area with a lot of people, washing your hands frequently — these are always a plus,” she says. Taking steps to prevent an RSV infection can also lower the likelihood that you’ll experience other health issues too, Linder says. “After an RSV infection, people are at significantly higher risk for heart disease, for example. So just having a respiratory viral infection﻿ doesn’t only mean things are going to be affecting your respiratory system,” she explains.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/stomach-symptoms/,"10 Stomach Symptoms You Should Never Ignore They can signal cancer, digestive disorders or another serious disease By Michelle Crouch, Updated March 20, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published February 11, 2020 / Updated March 20, 2025 Srdjan Radevic / EyeEm / Getty Images Everyone has stomach issues from time to time, and occasional digestive discomfort is not usually something to worry about. That said, doctors note that there are a few gastrointestinal symptoms you shouldn’t write off, because they could signal something serious. “I’ve seen many cases where patients have waited way too long before seeking medical attention,” says Christine Lee, M.D., a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Here are 10 symptoms you should never ignore and what they may mean. 1. Prolonged diarrhea Diarrhea can be a symptom of a number of things — from a food allergy to a bacterial infection. It can also be a warning sign of COVID-19, appearing before more well-known symptoms such as cough or fever, says Brennan Spiegel, M.D., director of health services research for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Studies show that as many as half of COVID-19 patients have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and about 15 to 20 percent have only GI symptoms. Diarrhea and an upset stomach can also be symptoms of the flu, though it's more common for children to experience tummy troubles with influenza than adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If you have diarrhea, nausea/vomiting or abdominal pain that lasts more than a day, “don’t wait for a cough or shortness of breath to get tested for COVID,” Spiegel says. If your test is positive, you could be eligible for antiviral treatments that can help keep mild symptoms from progressing to more serious ones. ﻿Prolonged diarrhea can also signal another type of infection or an underlying condition like ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 2. Blood in your stool Whether bright red, maroon or black, seeing blood in the toilet can be frightening. Fortunately, it’s usually not a symptom of anything life-threatening, says Nicholas E. Anthony, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Atrium Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. The most common causes are hemorrhoids and anal fissures (tears in the lining of the anus). But blood in your stool can also be one of the first symptoms of colon cancer, especially if accompanied by a change in your bowel habits or the shape of your stool. Since colon cancer is more common among those over age 50, it’s especially important for older adults to see a doctor without delay. Other possible causes of bleeding are colon polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, colitis and diverticulosis. 3. Severe cramps after eating Severe cramping is a warning sign of a bowel obstruction — a serious condition that requires immediate medical treatment. It’s also a classic symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic digestive disorder that has been on the rise in the last several years. Other IBS symptoms include abdominal pain (often related to bowel movements), bloating, gas, diarrhea or constipation. 4. Difficulty swallowing If you feel like your food is getting stuck in your throat or it hurts as it’s going down, that can be a sign of something serious. “The big thing we worry about is esophageal cancer,” Anthony says. Esophageal cancer is more common in adults over 55 and three or four times more likely to occur in men than women, according to the CDC. ﻿ Other things that can cause discomfort when you swallow include an infection, an ulcer, a sore or scar tissue (which can develop if you have chronic acid reflux). In addition, a growing number of people are being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE), a chronic allergic inflammatory disease that is a major cause of swallowing issues. To pinpoint the cause of your problem, your gastroenterologist will probably insert a tube with a camera attached to it down your throat in a procedure called an endoscopy. 5. Unexplained weight loss (especially if accompanied by abdominal pain) Weight loss when you haven’t changed your diet or exercise habits is a common symptom of many serious illnesses, including cancer, Lee says. “Most people gain weight as they get older because their metabolism slows down,” she says. “If you’re losing weight without much effort, that’s a red flag.” See a doctor if you’ve dropped 5 percent or more of your body weight within six to 12 months. Although such weight loss is a symptom of some types of cancer, research suggests that in patients over 65, it is often due to other causes, like peptic ulcers, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease or an overactive thyroid. 6. Chronic or prolonged constipation (especially if you’re having pain) Almost everyone experiences occasional bouts of constipation, and studies show that it’s especially prevalent among older adults. Constipation is typically defined as three or fewer bowel movements per week. It may not seem like a big deal, but if your constipation isn’t treated, over time the stools in your colon can become so large and solid that your body can’t remove them — and that can be painful or even deadly, Anthony warns. “If it goes longer than seven days, I want to see you,” he says. Constipation can be caused by a wide variety of issues, including certain medicines, a diet low in fiber, and medical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, thyroid issues, diabetes or, in rare cases, colorectal cancer. 7. Sudden, intense abdominal pain A sharp pain that doesn’t let up can indicate acute appendicitis (if it’s on your lower right side), diverticulitis or a serious infection. The context is important, Lee says, because muscle cramps and other issues can also manifest as sharp pain. “If you’re an athlete rock climbing and you get a sharp pain in your abdomen that only lasts a second, you probably just pulled a muscle,” she says. If it’s something serious, she explains, usually the pain keeps escalating and doesn’t let up. 8. Frequent, severe or worsening heartburn Occasional heartburn — a burning, uncomfortable sensation in your chest — is common among older adults and can usually be treated with over-the-counter medications. But if your heartburn is frequent and worsening, or if it’s not responding to medication, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a disorder in which the valve between your stomach and esophagus doesn’t close properly. Left untreated, GERD can lead to complications including erosion or narrowing of the esophagus, or a precancerous condition called Barrett’s esophagus. In rare cases, severe heartburn can also indicate a more serious condition such as esophageal cancer or a hiatal hernia. 9. Swollen abdomen It’s not unusual to feel bloated after you eat a big meal. But there’s a difference between bloating and distension, an actual increase in measured abdominal size. “Do you literally see your belly puffing out? Is it bigger in circumference?” Spiegel asks. If the answer is yes — and the symptom persists after you’ve had plenty of time to digest a meal — it can be a sign that excess fluid or gas is forming in your small intestine as the result of an obstruction, inflammation, bacterial overgrowth or a gastrointestinal disease. 10. Feeling full after eating very little If you feel stuffed even though you didn’t eat much, the most common cause is gastroparesis, a condition in which food stays in the stomach longer than it should. It can happen when a severe illness “stunts the electrical system of the stomach,” Anthony says﻿.﻿ Stomach surgery and diabetes can also trigger the condition, and it's been reported as a side effect of new weight loss medications. Although gastroparesis can resolve on its own, your doctor can prescribe medications that will stimulate your stomach to contract and help speed digestion. If it’s not gastroparesis, other more serious causes of early satiety include an ulcer, an obstruction or a tumor. If you don’t have one of the above symptoms, don’t let that keep you from seeing a gastroenterologist if you suspect that something’s wrong, Lee says. The earlier you detect a problem, the more options you have and the better your chances of success at managing it. “The longer I do this, the more I realize that it doesn’t matter what the textbook says — patients know their bodies,” Lee says. “If something is not normal for you, then it is a red flag, even if it’s not on the list of top five. If something bothers you, you should get it checked out.” Editor’s note: This story, first published February 11, 2020, has been updated to include new information. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Previously, the recommendation was that adults 65 and older get the shot — most adults just need one dose —﻿ as well as individuals 19 to 64 with certain health conditions that make them more susceptible to the disease. William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, says the updated recommendations make things “much simpler” for patients and providers. Roughly 30 to 50 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 have an underlying condition that puts them at higher risk for pneumococcal disease, data shows. “So we would really like to vaccinate a large portion of that population,” Schaffner says. ﻿ Plus, invasive pneumococcal disease, which Schaffner describes as “the most serious kind,” tends to occur at higher rates in Black Americans at younger ages (50 to 64). Lowering the recommended age to 50 “will provide protection for that population at a younger age, when they need it,” he says. “This is a great opportunity to prevent much more illness.” ﻿ What is pneumococcal disease? It’s an umbrella term for any infection caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria — pneumonia and meningitis are a few examples. This bacteria spreads when respiratory secretions (think saliva or mucus) are sent through the air by coughing or sneezing and then inhaled. Streptococcus pneumoniae are particularly lethal for the lungs and can potentially lead to pneumococcal pneumonia, the most common type of bacterial pneumonia the U﻿n﻿i﻿t﻿e﻿d﻿ States. An estimated 150,000 Americans are hospitalized with this illness each year, and it kills about 1 in 20 of those infected. Even with appropriate antibiotics, pneumococcal pneumonia, “particularly in people 65 and older,” has a high case-fatality rate, notes Gregory Poland, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. A big reason: As we age, the immune system becomes less able to fight off infections. But studies show the pneumococcal vaccine can help lower your chances of contracting the disease﻿, or reduce its severity if you do get it, possibly saving you from a stint in the hospital or even death. That alone is a good reason to get the vaccine once you’re eligible. Here are five others. 1. It’s flu season Flu season is upon us, and that matters because “pneumococcal pneumonia can follow other viral infections, particularly influenza,” Schaffner says. Here’s how: The flu virus attaches to, and infects, the cells lining the mucous membranes in the back of the throat and nose. Normally, the cells eject infectious agents out of the body via the nose or mouth, or they’re simply swallowed. But when impaired by the flu, the cells lining these membranes allow bacteria to slip down into the bronchial tubes and trigger a secondary infection in the lungs. The infection inflames the air sacs in the lungs and causes them to fill with pus and fluid, making it harder to breathe and triggering a whole host of other unpleasant symptoms. The flu shot can reduce your likelihood of experiencing this dangerous dual flu-pneumonia infection. So can the pneumococcal vaccine, which unlike the flu shot, isn’t given on an annual basis. For most, one jab will do it. That said, if you’re going in for your flu shot and are eligible for your pneumococcal vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says you can get them at the same time. You can also get the pneumococcal vaccine on another visit. ﻿""It does not have to be seasonal﻿,” Schaffner says. 2. It can help prevent serious infections throughout the body Your lungs aren’t the only part of the body vulnerable to pneumococcal infections. Those pathogens can invade other areas as well. “Bacterial infections, by their nature, are dirty infections — they are bugs in our system,” says Ian Neel, M.D., associate professor of medicine and medical director in the Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology at UC San Diego Health. “If left untreated, or if part of a particularly virulent strain, they typically take hold in a specific site — the lungs, for example. If they expand too much, they can get into other surrounding tissues and can move into our bloodstream. And if it’s in our bloodstream, it can get spread throughout our body, which can be catastrophic.” To say the least. Pneumococcal infections can lead to sepsis, which is an aggressive inflammatory response that can ultimately result in organ failure and death. In rarer cases, the infection can pass through the brain barrier and cause meningitis. 3. It might protect your ticker Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U﻿n﻿i﻿t﻿e﻿d﻿ S﻿t﻿a﻿t﻿e﻿s, and the pneumococcal vaccine may help protect against cardiovascular events in adults. A meta-analysis of 18 studies, with over 700,000 participants, found the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23) provided protection from some cardiovascular events — specifically a heart attack — in people who were vaccinated, particularly those 65 years and older. “One of the things we have learned about the germs that cause inflammation in our bodies — these influenza and pneumococcal organisms — is that even after we recover from the acute illness, the inflammation persists for a while and can put us at increased risk of a heart attack,” Schaffner says. 4. It may benefit your brain While more studies are needed, promising research suggests that the pneumococcal vaccine may also be associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. A team of researchers from Duke University reviewed the medication records of more than 5,000 adults 65 and older to seek out a link between the pneumococcal vaccination and a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. They found that people who received the pneumococcal vaccine between ages 65 and 75 had a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease later in life by as much as 40 percent. The results were presented at the 2020 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference alongside other research that also linked the influenza vaccine to a lower risk of dementia. “Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer’s risk later in life, depending on [genetic makeup],” study author Svetlana Ukraintseva said in a news release. “These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer’s prevention, particularly in noncarriers of certain risk genes.” 5. Pneumonia can be sneaky Many people, children in particular, can have this bacteria in their nose or throat and not display any symptoms, since their immune system stops the germs from moving to another part of the body. However, they can still transmit the disease to others. What’s more, symptoms of pneumonia— including fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and coughing up phlegm or mucus — make it easy to mistake for merely a stubborn cold or a bout of flu or COVID-19. But unlike with a cold, flu or COVID, antibiotics are often needed to treat pneumococcal pneumonia. What to know about the pneumococcal vaccine Who needs it: Young children aside, the CDC recommends pneumococcal vaccines for adults 50 and older. Younger adults with certain health conditions may also be eligible for the shot. Which one to get: There are several different types of pneumococcal vaccines on the market — and more in the research pipeline — but the CDC recommends PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21 for older adults. Just know that if you get PCV15, it should be followed by the PPSV23 vaccine, another type of pneumococcal vaccine, at least one year later to complete the series. (This can be shortened to eight weeks when a patient has an immunocompromising condition.) If you’ve received a pneumococcal vaccine in the past but never completed your series, ask your health care provider which shot you should receive. Why you need it: Pneumococcal pneumonia leads to approximately 150,000 hospitalizations each year in the U﻿n﻿i﻿t﻿e﻿d﻿ S﻿﻿t﻿a﻿t﻿e﻿s, CDC statistics show. Young children and older adults have the highest incidence of serious illness, and older adults are more likely to die from it.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/healthy-eating-for-two/,"Tips for Healthy and Delicious Cooking for Two Ellie Krieger's butternut squash soup recipe and advice for eating well Courtesy Ellie Krieger By: Christina Ianzito, En español Published November 12, 2019 If your priorities include both good food and a healthy diet, Ellie Krieger is the chef for you. Host and executive producer of the public television show Ellie's Real Good Food and a best-selling cookbook author, Krieger defies the common belief that, as she puts it, “delicious is on one end of the spectrum and healthy is on the other end.” She calls that place where healthy and delicious meet “the sweet spot” — and you'll find all of her recipes inside that spot, including those in her new cookbook Whole in One: Complete, Healthy Meals in a Single Pot, Sheet Pan, or Skillet (see her recipe for butternut squash soup, below). We talked to Krieger, 54, about how to make healthy cooking a delicious, easy part of your day, and even something fun to do with your honey. Her food philosophy Courtesy Ellie Krieger It really centers on looking at food as “usually,” “sometimes” or “rarely.” You make the backbone of what you're eating the “usually” foods, such as vegetables, whole fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans, healthy fats, seafood, lean protein. The other foods are “sometimes” and “rarely” — you sprinkle them in and they can add flavor and texture. Then you can have the lusciousness that you want in your food and still keep an overall really great nutritional profile. And there's no such thing as “never"": There's no forbidden fruit, which kind of takes the stress and guilt out of it. Cooking for two My daughter is graduating from high school this year and she's not home as much, so my husband and I are definitely getting into that cooking-for-two zone. It's become a nice project for us to do together, like our little ritual, where we put music on — good music, to help switch our day into another zone, out of the work mentality — and open a bottle of wine. Cooking is easier if you rethink the process, not as a chore but as just a nice part of the day. And the one-pot meals make it easier. In the entire book each recipe uses just one vessel. You need just six cookware items to make all of the 125 recipes, and you probably have them already. How to avoid overeating at dinner I never put a platter on the table. I keep the food in the kitchen, and we each take a portion and go to the table. If you want more, you have to get up and refill your plate, which makes you stop and say, “Do I really need more?” Some days you're hungrier than others and that's OK — I feel like people should trust their appetite. But keeping the food in the kitchen and off the table is a good way to minimize mindless eating. Healthy breakfast idea Oatmeal with nuts and berries, whatever fruit is in season. Now I'm really into adding apple and some pureed pumpkin, kind of like a harvest oatmeal. I also have a great Pumpkin Spice Overnight Oats recipe. This glorious bowl of goodness is the epitome of modern comfort food. The soup itself is a golden, fragrantly spiced puree of butternut squash, made hearty and protein-rich with the addition of canned chickpeas blended right in. But it’s the garnishes that seal the deal. A finishing drizzle of tahini adds a beautiful pale ribbon of creamy richness, punctuated by flecks of fresh parsley, and a new favorite from the snack aisle of the store — crispy chickpeas — make for a fun, healthy, crouton-like crunch. If you want to explore some other squash varieties, kabocha or honey nut would work well here, too. 2 tablespoons olive oil1 large onion, chopped3 garlic cloves, chopped7.5 cups butternut squash, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 2 pounds)1 cup canned no-salt-addedchickpeas, drained and rinsed3/4 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon ground cumin1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1/8 teaspoon ground turmericPinch of cayenne pepper5 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth1 tablespoon honey2 tablespoons tahini1/2 cup packaged crispy chickpea snacks(plain or lightly salted)2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Courtesy Ellie Krieger 1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 4 minutes; add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Stir in the squash, chickpeas, salt, cumin, black pepper, turmeric and cayenne. 2. Add the broth and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until the squash is very tender, about 20 minutes. 3. Use an immersion blender to puree until smooth. (Alternatively, allow to cool slightly, then puree it in several batches in a regular blender.) Stir in the honey. 4. Place the tahini in a bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons of cold water. Add more water by the teaspoon until the tahini is loose enough to be drizzled. Serve the soup drizzled with the tahini, garnished with the crispy chickpeas and parsley.

Among other things, ultraviolet (UV) rays can increase your chances of contracting debilitating conditions like cataracts and even cancer. “I can honestly tell when somebody was born and raised in Florida [and] when they weren’t,” says Kimberly Caracci, an optometrist at the Cleveland Clinic Florida. She explains that she can tell apart her patients who spent years in the Florida sun just by the damage it did to their eyes. Still, no need to stay inside to avoid the sun’s harmful rays. Sunglasses are an efficient — and stylish — way to protect your peepers, as long as they provide 100 percent UVA and UVB protection. Here are 7 good reasons to wear them: UVA and UVB The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) radiation that can be harmful to our skin and eyes. UVA and UVB stand for different wavelengths that pose different risks to our body — including skin aging for UVA and sunburn for UVB. Both can increase your risk for skin cancer. 1. Not protecting your eyes on a sunny day could lead to eyestrain and headaches. You may have experienced this on a particularly bright day. “If I don’t wear sunglasses, and you tell me to drive for an hour in sunny conditions, I will certainly have a headache,” says Alister Gibbons, M.D., an ophthalmologist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and an associate professor at the University of Miami. Squinting because of the light could fatigue your eyes, which might in turn lead to eyestrain and headaches. 2. You can get skin cancer on your eyelids, too. The skin on your eyelids is the thinnest on your body, but it’s hard to protect it against the sun’s harmful rays. Putting sunscreen on your eyelids can lead to irritation or styes, Caracci says, which makes sunglasses a must. Protecting your eyelids with sunglasses could also slow your skin’s aging process and limit the formation of wrinkles. 3. The sun can cause small growths on your eyes. These small bumps, called pingueculae and pterygia, grow on the conjunctiva, which covers the white part of your eyes. The more you expose your eyes to the sun, the more likely you are to get one of these bumps. Wind and dust are also believed to cause their formation. While a pinguecula may contain deposits of protein, fat or calcium, the American Academy of Ophthalmology explains, a pterygium (also known as surfer's eye) is a growth of fleshy tissue that may start as a pinguecula. “If [a pterygium] grows close enough to the center of the cornea, it will very much drop your vision,” says Peter J. McDonnell, M.D., director of the Wilmer Eye Institute and a professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. UVA and UVB The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) radiation that can be harmful to our skin and eyes. UVA and UVB stand for different wavelengths that pose different risks to our body — including skin aging for UVA and sunburn for UVB. Both can increase your risk for skin cancer. 4. Your eyes, too, can get sunburnt. This condition is called photokeratitis. “It’s actually very common […] to see people that went skiing without any sort of eye protection literally burning their corneas,” Gibbons says. That specific condition is referred to as snow blindness, but your eyes can also get sunburnt at the beach from the sun’s reflection on the sand and water. “Fortunately, it’s temporary, and it usually doesn’t leave any lasting damage. But it can be extremely painful,” Gibbons says. 5. Sun exposure over time can increase your risk of developing cataracts. Everyone would get cataracts — a condition in which the eye’s lens becomes cloudy — if they lived long enough, McDonnell explains. But spending too much time in the sun could lead to an earlier onset of the disease. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 10 percent of cataracts may be caused by overexposure to UV light and could be avoided. 6. You can get melanoma in your eyes. Skin isn’t the only area of your body where you can get a dangerous cancer called melanoma. The choroid — the layer located between the white of the eye and the retina — contains a lot of melanocytes, the cells that produce and contain melanin. “They can start multiplying and cause very aggressive cancers that can make you lose [not only] your eye, your vision, but even your life,” Gibbons says. Ocular melanoma can also appear in the iris or ciliary body — sometimes even on the conjunctiva. People with light skin and eyes, as well as those over 50, are at higher risk, but the condition remains very rare. Specialists still don't know exactly what causes eye melanoma, but sun exposure may contribute to the development of the disease. 7. Sunglasses are not bad for your health. Gibbons says the myth that sunglasses can be harmful might have originated at a time when sunglasses didn’t offer 100 percent UVA and UVB protection. “Patients [would] wear the sunglasses, and their pupils would become a little bigger because it was less light coming in,” he says. “So, if your pupils are a little bit bigger, but you’re not blocking the UV light, you will get more [harmful light] into your eye.” But this won’t be an issue with most sunglasses today, he says, because nearly all sunglasses offer UVA and UVB protection. A Guide to Sunglasses Opt for sunglasses that provide 100 percent UVA and UVB protection (also referred to as UV 400). “Any sunglasses sold in the U.S. should meet that norm,” Gibbons says. But when in doubt, you can take your sunglasses to an optician, who can use a photometer to inspect your lenses. Wear sunglasses (almost) every time you’re out. A cloudy day doesn’t mean a UV-free day. “You can get a sunburn on a cloudy day, and you can get UV light in your eyes,” McDonnell says. This is especially true for people who spend a lot of time outside, like hikers, sailors, skiers or golfers. Don’t forget your hat (and sunscreen). A hat with a brim will help protect areas not covered by the sunglasses. “One of my professors years ago showed that if you have sunglasses on that are 100 percent UV absorbing, [you’ll only] block 60 percent of the UV, because a lot will come from above and underneath, reflect off your nose and get into your eye,” McDonnell says. “When I watch my ophthalmologist friends, almost all of the time, they’re wearing their sunglasses and a hat with a brim.” Contact lenses are not enough. Some contacts will offer UV protection, but they will leave many parts of the eye defenseless against the sun’s harmful rays. “Anything in front of the cornea, the surface of the eye, the eyelids, etc ... are not being protected by the contact lens,” Gibbons says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/medications-heat-intolerance/,"Extreme Heat View Series 8 Types of Medications That Can Make It Harder to Handle the Heat Common drugs could make hot days more dangerous for many older adults By Merle Myerson, M.D., Updated May 12, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published July 21, 2023 / Updated May 12, 2025 Getty Images With summer just around the corner, temperatures are rising in many regions of the country, putting people — especially older adults, who are most vulnerable to heat’s dangers — at risk for heat-related illness, even death. And one thing that doesn’t help is if you are taking medications that interfere with your body’s ability to cool itself down. Several pills and potions can affect how well the body is able to handle heat — an issue that is “particularly important for older people” because they tend to be on more of these medications, says Cec﻿ilia Sorensen, M.D., ﻿director of the Global Consortium on Climate Health and Education at Columbia University in New York City. It’s crucial to pay attention to this often-overlooked side effect during heat waves, which the Environmental Protection Agency says are increasing in both intensity and frequency — but it’s not just those stifling stretches that can be dangerous. Research shows that older patients with chronic medical conditions who take heat-sensitive medications can have medication-related problems throughout the entire summer. Medications and the Sun Is your medicine making your skin sensitive in the sun? These five drugs can put you at greater risk for sunburn-like symptoms, a rash or other unwanted side effects. Antibiotics: tetracycline (Panmycin), doxycycline (Vibramycin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ofloxacin (Floxin) Antifungals: griseofulvin (Gris-PEG) Antihistamines: lorat﻿adine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) Statin cholesterol medications: simvastatin (Zocor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol) Diabetes medications: sulfonylureas like ﻿glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Micronase) How do medications affect your heat tolerance? First, it’s important to understand how your body deals with heat and works to maintain that ideal internal temperature of 98.6 degrees. To cool off, your body has several tricks. One is perspiration, or sweat. When sweat evaporates from your skin, it cools the body. ﻿Another is when the blood vessels underneath your skin vasodilate (widen) and bring warm blood closer to your skin, allowing the skin to release heat. Several different medications, though, can interfere with this complex thermoregulation system by limiting the body’s ability to sweat or by reducing blood flow to the skin. Medications can also cause dehydration, and some may make the skin more sensitive to the sun, causing a rash or sunburn. Some individuals are more susceptible to these heat-related issues than others. Risk factors include being over 65, having chronic medical conditions and being overweight. Spending time outside during the warmest part of the day — especially if you are doing yard work, physical activity or exercise — also increases your risk. Dave Kent, a retired librarian, had a heart attack more than a decade ago; exercise, along with cardiac medications, is part of his treatment plan. But when the forecast calls for heat, he plans his outdoor activities for the cooler times of the day to avoid medication side effects. “I think having an active lifestyle ﻿and maintaining a healthy diet are the keys to dealing with whatever Mother Nature throws at us,” Kent says. 8 types of medications that don’t mix with heat Below are some examples﻿ of commonly used medications that can make it harder for your body to handle the heat. 1. Heart medications Prescribed for high blood pressure and blood clot prevention and to support the pumping function of the heart. Diuretics (also called water pills): furosemide (Lasix), chlorthalidone (Hygroton), hydrochlorthiazide (Microzide, HydroDiuril) Beta blockers: metoprolol (Toprol, Lopressor), atenolol (Tenormin), carvedilol (Coreg), propranolol (Inderal) ACE Inhibitors: lisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil) Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs): losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan) Antiplatelets: clopidogrel (Plavix) Medications and the Sun Is your medicine making your skin sensitive in the sun? These five drugs can put you at greater risk for sunburn-like symptoms, a rash or other unwanted side effects. Antibiotics: tetracycline (Panmycin), doxycycline (Vibramycin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ofloxacin (Floxin) Antifungals: griseofulvin (Gris-PEG) Antihistamines: lorat﻿adine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) Statin cholesterol medications: simvastatin (Zocor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol) Diabetes medications: sulfonylureas like ﻿glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Micronase) 2. Antidepressants Prescribed to treat depression and anxiety. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft) Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): duloxetine (Cymbalta), Venlafaxine (Effexor XR) Tricyclic antidepressants: amitriptyline (Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor) 3. Antipsychotics Prescribed for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other mental health disorders. Examples: risperidone (Risperdal) Quetiapine (Seroquel), Haloperidol (Haldol), Olanzapine (Zyprexa) 4. Central nervous system stimulants Prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Examples: dextroamphetamine (Adderall), methamphetamine (Desoxyn), methylphenidate (Ritalin) 5. Anticholinergics Prescribed for Parkinson’s disease and overactive bladder. Examples: benztropine (Cogentin), oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), tolterodine (Detrol) When is “hot” too hot? Weather forecasters use something called the heat index to measure what the weather actually feels like to you. The index considers both the temperature and humidity. For example, if the temperature is 100 degrees and the relative humidity is 55 percent, it will feel like 124 degrees out. At 80 degrees to 90 degrees, the National Weather Service advises caution with prolonged exposure. Note that the heat index is calculated with temperatures in the shade but can increase by up to 15 degrees in direct sunlight. Source: National Weather Service 6. Antihistamines Used for seasonal allergies, bug bites and beestings. Examples: diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 7. Decongestants. Used for the common cold and allergies. Examples: pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), phenylephrine (Sudafed PE), Oxymetazoline nasal spray (Afrin, Zicam, Dristan, Mucinex) 8. Dopaminergics. Prescribed for Parkinson’s disease. Examples: carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) If you are taking a medication that can be problematic in the heat, it’s a good idea to set aside time to discuss this with your doctor and hatch a plan for hot-weather days. “To avoid these problems, health professionals need to be aware of what medications put older people at risk and educate them and their caregivers,” Columbia University’s Sorensen says. There aren’t specific protocols for prescribing medications during hot weather, explains Soko Setoguchi, M.D., ﻿professor of medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and an expert on the health effects of medications. However, your doctor may want to lower the dose of a medication or sub in another. 5 tips for managing medications in the heat Don’t abruptly stop any medication. Many must be taken daily to keep the blood level high enough. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned.Make sure you store medications properly. Insulin, for example, can become less effective if left in the heat.Stay hydrated. Clues that you might be dehydrated are loss of body weight, making less urine and producing urine that’s darker than usual. Water from the tap (squeeze some lemon juice in for flavor) is a great way to hydrate, but be sure to check with your doctor if you have been put on fluid restriction. Avoid alcohol, as this can make you dehydrated.Keep cool. Wear light, loose-fitting clothes, pull down the shades at home, use a fan or air-conditioning, and avoid outdoor activity during the hottest times of the day.If a medication causes photosensitivity (see sidebar), wear sunscreen (SPF 15 or greater) and a sun-protective hat and clothes.

Alzheimer’s Association CEO Joanna Pike called it “a tremendous step forward.” But while the medication, known as Leqembi, slows mental decline — by about five﻿ months in some patients who have early stage disease — it doesn’t repair the damage in the brain or stop the disease from ever progressing. There are also risks involved with its use. The excitement comes from the fact that finally, after two decades of effort, there’s at least one drug available to slow the disease. It’s been a long slog with many failures along the way to get to this milestone. Researchers have faced a slew of difficulties in coming up with treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, which affects more than 6 million people in the United States, 55 million worldwide, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Some of the challenges in developing drugs for Alzheimer’s and other causes of dementia apply to any drug aimed at the human brain. Others are specific to the unique hurdles surrounding Alzheimer’s disease. 1. Scientists aren’t sure what causes Alzheimer’s disease. Some firmly believe that Alzheimer’s is primarily caused by what’s known as amyloid plaques. These occur when a protein in the brain breaks down incorrectly into clumps. Those toxic clumps form sticky collections between nerve cells, stopping the cells from functioning as they should. But others are not convinced. One problem is that the amount of amyloid plaques in a person’s brain doesn’t correspond to whether they show signs of dementia, says neurologist Alberto Espay, M.D., at the University of Cincinnati. By the age of 85, he says, “Sixty percent of us have this in our brains.” Yet many fewer, under a third of people 85 and older, will have dementia, according to the National Institute on Aging. Another problem: Those antibody drugs, including Leqembi, that clear away amyloid plaques only have small effects on the dementia itself. That’s what makes Lon Schneider, M.D., skeptical. The effects are statistically significant, with patients receiving the drugs showing less decline in cognition than people who got a placebo, says Schneider, who studies Alzheimer’s disease at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. But the size of the difference is so small that many patients and their caregivers might not be able to detect it. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits Just because these drugs haven’t shown miraculous effects, the beta amyloid plaques could still be the cause, says psychiatrist Clive Ballard, M.D., who studies cognitive health and dementia at the University of Exeter in England. It may be that the antibody drugs have simply failed so far to clear the right plaques, or clear them from the right places. 2. Most drugs fail during testing. Getting a new drug from the lab to the pharmacy is a long and costly process. In fact, for all the drugs that make it into human testing, more than 90 percent never get any further, according to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. The number of drugs for dementia that fail “might be a little bit higher” than average, Ballard says. But “it’s not radically different.” What is different is that there are very few clinical trials for dementia at all. “If you only have 50 trials, you’re touch-and-go whether you’re going to get one compound out of that,” he says. As of January 2023, 141 drugs were being tested in patients for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers reported in May 2023 in Translational Research & Clinical Interventions. 3. Brains are almost impenetrable. The human brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier, a layer of cells separating the brain from harmful things in the blood. Imagine a security guard letting oxygen and important hormones in, but blocking bacteria, viruses and toxins from reaching the delicate cells of the brain. Unfortunately, that barrier shuts out a lot of potentially helpful drugs, too. “Your immediate problem is that only 20 percent of the compounds … cross the blood-brain barrier,” Ballard says. Scientists are testing some clever workarounds, attaching the drugs to nanoparticles or tucking them inside little water-friendly packages called hydrogels to smuggle the drugs past the brain’s security system. 4. Treating a symptom isn’t treating a disease. Most of the medications for people with Alzheimer’s aim at the symptoms, not the cause of the disease. Once diagnosed with dementia, a patient may receive drugs like a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine to adjust levels of some brain chemicals and ease some problems. “You give a patient something that helps his symptoms,” Espay says. But that’s a bit like taking Tylenol because you have the flu and a fever. The drug brings the fever down and makes you more comfortable. But the fever is just a symptom; you still have the flu. It’s no small thing to treat those symptoms, Ballard points out. For people with moderate dementia, “I think the maintenance of function is perhaps most important,” he says. It’s “the difference between, say, being able to walk a few steps independently and needing a hoist to be moved. That’s a huge impact on independence and quality of life.” The recently approved Leqembi and other antibody drugs still being tested, however, go after the cause of the disease. These drugs bind to and clear away the sticky amyloid plaques. If those plaques are the cause of Alzheimer’s disease, scientists could be on to something. ​But there’s probably more involved in this disease. So, researchers are pursuing many potential players in the disease, such as inflammation and microglia — small cells that are a kind of clean-up crew in the brain. Some studies are even targeting circadian rhythms (the body’s internal clock) or hormones like estrogen that might play a role in the disease. ​ 5. There’s not a lot of funding for Alzheimer’s research. Part of the problem comes back to the lack of clarity on the cause of Alzheimer’s and the steep costs of developing a single drug. Ballard says it’s also a problem that there’s less awareness around dementia — and less hope. “People are now beginning to become aware of [dementia], but they still see it as a death sentence,” he says. “The more you have hope and the more treatments potentially can do something, the easier it is to persuade people to invest in it.” The U.S. government will spend about $3.7 billion on Alzheimer’s and dementia research in 2023, according to the National Institutes of Health. This is a big increase from 2015, when the federal government funded $631 million in research. But it’s also not much more than the $3.﻿3 billion that will be spent on HIV/AIDS. Around 119,000 people died from Alzheimer’s disease in 2022. Compare that to the 18,000 people diagnosed with HIV that died of any cause in 2020, the latest year data is available. Because of a lot of research and funding, many people are living long, healthy lives with HIV. With more funding and research for Alzheimer’s disease, some day it might, like HIV, go from a death sentence to a manageable condition. The new antibody treatments have Ballard feeling optimistic. “We’re starting to get some treatments that start looking like [they have] benefit,” he says. While the trials are limited, and focus on people with early disease, any small success gives people hope. Hope, he adds, sparks more research, and eventually, more treatments.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/vaccines-may-prevent-dementia/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by Can Vaccinations Save Your Brain? There’s growing evidence that getting your shots can lower dementia risk By Marlene Cimons, Updated September 03, 2024 AARP By William Schaffner, M.D. Comments En español Published October 16, 2023 / Updated September 03, 2024 MATT CHINWORTH As autumn comes around, so do the placards and public service announcements alerting us to get our flu shots, update our COVID-19 vaccines and generally get on top of the inoculations we need as we get older. New research offers one more good reason to stay current on your vaccinations: The shots also might decrease the risk of age-related cognitive decline.﻿ Previous studies have shown a cognitive benefit from annual flu shots as well as other vaccines, including the first shingles vaccine (Zostavax), which is no longer used. More recently, a new study suggests the latest shingles vaccine (Shingrix) offers more protection against developing Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia than the earlier version. “Our study adds to the evidence that, rather unexpectedly, vaccines may have health benefits beyond simply the infection they are designed to prevent,” says the study’s senior author, Paul Harrison, M.D., professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford. “This is especially true for the new shingles vaccine, which in our study was associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia in the following six years compared to the previous shingles vaccine,” as well as to other vaccines. “Vaccination is the right thing to do to protect yourself from flu and other infections,” says Paul E. Schulz, M.D., professor of neurology and director of the Neurocognitive Disorders Center at the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston. “Now there is also the potential fringe benefit of vaccination, which is reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s.” The early studies found that those who get vaccinated for the flu and other infectious diseases appear less likely than their unvaccinated counterparts to get dementia﻿ —﻿ although it’s unclear why. Scientists are still studying what happens in the brain to cause this. ​How do vaccines work against dementia? One theory is that infectious agents -- such as the herpes virus that causes chickenpox and stays dormant in the body and can cause shingles years later -- play a role in developing Alzheimer's disease. ​​﻿""There is some evidence that herpes viruses are a risk factor for dementia and so preventing active infection might slow down this process,"" Harrison says. Another explanation worth considering, he adds: ""The new shingles vaccine contains adjuvants -- chemicals that increase the immune system's response to the vaccine--and maybe they have an unexpected beneficial effect on brain health.""​﻿ Schulz speculates that vaccination may reduce the immune system in the brain that is involved in attacking amyloid plaque (﻿a protein﻿ found in abnormally high levels that clumps together in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients) as an invader. Attacking these plaques sounds like a good idea, but the immune reaction may cause chronic brain inflammation and the death of nearby cells. “The problem in Alzheimer’s is that the immune system keeps trying to get rid of the plaque, and it can’t,” Schulz explains. “The plaque sits there for 10 years, and the immune system keeps throwing poisons at it all that time and is killing brain cells in the process.” Or maybe the opposite happens: The vaccines enhance the ability of the immune system to remove amyloid plaques, he says. ﻿ In the new shingles study, published in Nature Medicine in July, researchers at the University of Oxford studied more than 200,000 people 65 and older, comparing those who got the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, with those who got the old, Zostavax, and found at least a 17 percent reduction in dementia diagnoses in the six years following vaccination with Shingrix. That equates to 164 or more additional days lived without dementia, according to the scientists. “Other studies had shown that Zostavax - and most other vaccines - ‘beat’ no vaccination, so the Shingrix effect would look even bigger,” if you compared Shringrix to no vaccine, Harrison says. These latest data build upon previous research by Schultz and others suggesting vaccines convey similar protective effects against cognitive decline. Benefits of other vaccines Schulz was the senior author of a﻿n earlier study that found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of Alzheimer’s between those vaccinated against the flu﻿ and unvaccinated people. Two groups of 935,887 each were obtained from a national U.S. patient database. To ensure a valid comparison, both groups shared many of the same characteristics and risk factors, including age, gender and conditions such as hypertension, Schulz says — except one group was vaccinated and the other was not. ﻿Patients who received at least one flu vaccine during the follow-up period of four years were 40 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s compared with those who did not get the vaccine. In addition, ﻿﻿those who received an annual flu shot had the lowest rate of the disease. “The more vaccinations you got, the better,” Schulz says. His team has also been studying the effects of vaccines for other infectious diseases, including shingles, pneumococcal pneumonia and the combination of tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough), known as Tdap, with similar findings, he says. ﻿ Pascal Geldsetzer, M.D., assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, has run studies in large groups of older adult in Wales and Australia, also finding a benefit of shingles vaccination against dementia. “This evidence suggests that the vaccine really could have benefits for delaying or preventing a condition that most people find even scarier than shingles,” Geldsetzer says. The accumulating evidence suggests that getting your vaccines pays compelling and unexpected dividends, starting with an annual flu shot every fall. Virologist Robert T. Schooley, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego — who has not been involved in any of the studies — says of the flu vaccine research, it is “certainly plausible” that reducing the frequency and severity of influenza through vaccination can quell immune activation over time. Though Schooley and others suggest some caution when interpreting the results. ""It is also possible that the differences in [cognitive] decline were associated with other factors for which vaccination might be a marker rather than a cause,” he says. “Access to vaccination could be an indicator of more access to health care, better socioeconomic status, more mobility or other factors that would favor better neurologic outcomes."" Schooley’s final note: “One thing is for certain: Whether or not this observation is real, staying up to date with vaccinations for influenza and other infectious diseases as we age is a good idea.” Marlene Cimons is a Maryland-based writer and frequent Washington Post contributor who specializes in health, science and the environment.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

The article explores the potential link between vaccinations and reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline, specifically dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have found that vaccines, including the flu and shingles vaccines, may lower the risk of dementia, with the new shingles vaccine (Shingrix) showing a 17% reduction in dementia diagnoses compared to the older vaccine (Zostavax). The exact mechanism is unclear, but theories include the possibility that vaccines reduce inflammation or enhance the immune system's ability to remove amyloid plaques. The findings suggest that staying up-to-date on vaccinations may have unexpected benefits beyond preventing infections.",197

Antiviral medications can help keep a mild coronavirus infection from turning severe By Rachel Nania, Updated March 26, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 01, 2023 / Updated March 26, 2025 Getty Images COVID-19 activity is calmer now than it was during the peak of winter, but public health experts warn not to get too complacent. Unlike influenza and other respiratory viruses, the coronavirus hasn’t settled into a seasonal pattern, and in past years, cases have climbed back up during the warmer months. If you find yourself testing positive for COVID this spring or summer, know that there are prescription treatments that can help keep a mild infection from turning severe. “So it’s important that everyone who’s infected and who is in a high-risk status have access to these medications,” says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. As the pandemic subsided, widespread access to free COVID-19 treatments came to an end. Now, patients need to rely on some combination of private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and assistance programs run by drugmakers to help cover the cost of once-free medications, including Paxlovid. Here’s what you need to do if you test positive for COVID-19 and are eligible for time-sensitive treatments. Who will have to pay for COVID treatments? If you have Medicare or Medicaid Medicare prescription drug plans (known as Part D) are required to cover oral antivirals for COVID-19, and out-of-pocket costs, if any, will vary by plan. If Medicare Part D enrollees have trouble obtaining antiviral coverage, they should contact their plan or 1-800-MEDICARE for assistance, a spokesperson from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services tells AARP. Some Medicare enrollees can get Paxlovid for free through a U.S. government patient assistance program operated by the drug’s maker, Pfizer, through Dec. 31, 2025, according to Pfizer’s website. People with Medicaid can also get free Paxlovid through this program. Here’s how it works: Eligible patients with a prescription for Paxlovid can enroll in the assistance program online at paxlovid.iassist.com or over the phone (877-219-7225). Pfizer estimates that the enrollment process takes about five minutes, and it can be done by the patient, a caregiver, a health care provider or a pharmacist at the point of care. The enrollment form will ask for the basics — name, date of birth, address, phone number, etc. You will also need to enter prescriber information and confirm your insurance status, so if someone else is enrolling for you, be sure they have this information. After enrolling, the patient will receive an electronic voucher that can be exchanged for a free course of Paxlovid at participating pharmacies. There isn’t a similar government program in place for Lagevrio, another oral antiviral for COVID-19 that is available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and is a treatment option for people who are unable to take Paxlovid or, if hospitalized, Veklury (remdesivir). What about Veklury?​ Veklury (remdesivir) is another COVID-19 antiviral treatment, but unlike Paxlovid and Lagevrio, it’s not a prescription pill you take at home. The medication is administered through an IV at a medical facility; therefore, it’s covered by Part B for people with Medicare. If you have commercial insurance, coverage and out-of-pocket costs for Veklury will vary by plan. ﻿​ Merck says it offers a Lagevrio patient assistance program for “eligible patients who, without assistance, could not otherwise afford the product.” It takes 10 to 20 minutes to determine a patient’s eligibility for this program; more information is available at merckhelps.com or by calling 800-727-5400. What about Veklury?​ Veklury (remdesivir) is another COVID-19 antiviral treatment, but unlike Paxlovid and Lagevrio, it’s not a prescription pill you take at home. The medication is administered through an IV at a medical facility; therefore, it’s covered by Part B for people with Medicare. If you have commercial insurance, coverage and out-of-pocket costs for Veklury will vary by plan. ﻿​ If you have private insurance You could face out-of-pocket costs for treating COVID-19 if you have private insurance, since Paxlovid and Lagevrio will “be subject to the regular cost-sharing policies” of your health plan, says Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of the Global Health & HIV Policy Program at KFF. In 2023, Pfizer priced Paxlovid at $1,390 for the five-day treatment course. If your plan doesn’t cover Paxlovid or if your out-of-pocket payment is high, you may be eligible to receive assistance through Pfizer’s copay program, which involves an enrollment process that is similar to the government-backed patient assistance program. To enroll in the copay program, visit paxlovid.com/paxcess or call 877-219-7225. Privately insured patients may be eligible for a coupon from Merck to help them save on out-of-pocket costs for Lagevrio. More information is available at lagevrio.com/patients/coupon/. If you don't have insurance You shouldn’t have to pay out of pocket for COVID-19 treatment in the next few years if you’re uninsured. Paxlovid will remain free for people without health insurance and for people who are underinsured through 2028, according to CMS. You’ll need to enroll in the patient assistance program to get the antiviral at no cost. More information is available at paxlovid.iassist.com or by calling 877-219-7225. Similarly, Merck’s patient assistance program is meant to help eligible individuals who can’t otherwise afford the full cost of the medication. More information is available at merckhelps.com or by calling 800-727-5400. Experts urge patients to be proactive Research highlighted by HHS finds that oral antiviral treatments can reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths by as much as tenfold for people at high risk for severe disease. This population includes adults 50 and older and people with underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease and obesity. However, in order for the medications to be effective, they must be started soon after symptoms appear — ideally within five days. Because time is of the essence, Mariana Socal, M.D., associate scientist in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says high-risk patients should talk to their doctor about whether they’re a good candidate for one of the available treatments before they even come down with COVID-19, so there’s a plan in place if they test positive. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Make sure you have coronavirus tests on hand, Socal adds, so if you experience symptoms, you can quickly know whether you’re dealing with COVID. If you have symptoms but test negative for COVID-19, it’s important to still talk to your doctor, Schaffner says. You may have another illness that requires a different course of treatment. “It is common for people to say, ‘Well, I’ll see if I get better tomorrow.’ And so they put things off, and of course, that allows the infection to continue,” Schaffner says. “We ought to overcome that reluctance and contact our providers early rather than later.” Editor's note: This story, first published Nov. 1, 2023, has been updated to include new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/allergy-medicine-side-effects/,"Brought to you by Hidden Risks of Allergy Medications Common over-the-counter drugs can come with dangerous side effects for older adults Vitapix / Getty Images By Hallie Levine, AARP En español Published April 20, 2022 Pollen counts are rising and so are allergy symptoms. But before you reach for an over-the-counter product to ease the sneezing, itching and runny nose, know this: Some allergy medications are more effective than others — and some can be downright dangerous for older adults. “Medications that were fine for you to take when you were younger can be more problematic as you age,” explains Joshua Niznik, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and Eshelman School of Pharmacy in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. “More of these medications pass through the blood-brain barrier and it’s harder for you to eliminate them from your body as you get older. As a result, you’re more prone to side effects.” Here’s how to handle your hay fever without unwanted side effects. Medications to avoid Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). The antihistamine diphenhydramine commonly causes sleepiness, but it can also usher in a slew of other symptoms in older adults, like anxiety, confusion, blurred vision, constipation and difficulty urinating. “All of these together raise the risk of falls, which is already a concern for older adults,” Niznik says. In 2019, falls sent roughly 3 million adults 65 and older to emergency rooms and caused more than 34,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Diphenhydramine is also part of a class of medications known as anticholinergics, which have been linked to dementia, according to a 2019 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. Researchers found that longer-term use of anticholinergics — which block acetylcholine, a chemical messenger in the brain involved in learning and memory — was associated with roughly a 50 percent greater risk for dementia in adults. It’s important to know that diphenhydramine is found in a number of combination medications that relieve allergy and cold-like symptoms (Sudafed PE Sinus Congestion Day + Night and Theraflu Nighttime Severe Cold & Cough, for example), so be sure to read the label carefully when shopping for relief. Decongestants. Stuffy nose? Beware of decongestants, including phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine, which are often found in products such as Sudafed. This is especially true if you have high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease. “Any decongestant will raise blood pressure, possibly causing an increase in heart arrhythmias,” says Kevin McGrath, M.D., an allergist in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and a spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma ﻿& Immunology. People with glaucoma or hyperthyroidism should also avoid decongestants, according to the Mayo Clinic. Taken too late in the day, decongestants can make it difficult to fall asleep. They can also lead to nervousness and a jittery or shaky feeling, McGrath says. While usually found in cold medicines, phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine are in some allergy products, as well. “In general, avoid anything that has a D in its name, like Zyrtec-D, since it has a decongestant added,” Niznik says. Allegra-D and Claritin-D are two other examples of allergy medicines that contain both a decongestant and an antihistamine. Decongestant nasal sprays such as Afrin don’t carry the same risks as their pill counterparts, but you do need to limit their use since they can cause rebound congestion, or constant stuffiness, if used too often. What to take instead Nasal steroid sprays. These are actually the first line of treatment for people with seasonal allergies, and studies show they can be even more effective than oral antihistamines. Three that McGrath recommends are Nasacort AQ﻿﻿ ﻿a﻿n﻿d Rhinocort Aqua (both require a prescription), and Flonase Sensimist, an over-the-counter product. To maximize effectiveness, use them the right way: Be sure to spray slightly to the outside of the nostril. “Use the right hand to spray up the left nostril and the left hand to spray up the right nostril,” McGrath says. “You do not want to spray into the middle of your nose, the septum, as this causes increased risk of nosebleeds and irritation.” Certain over-the-counter oral antihistamines. If a nasal steroid spray isn’t enough, you can pair it with an over-the-counter antihistamine. McGrath’s first choice for older adults is Allegra 180 mg. “It’s nonsedating as it does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it doesn't cause any drowsiness,” he explains. If you don’t have that on hand, he suggests Xyzal, which he says is less sedating than other brands. Allergy immunotherapy. These are regular injections over a period of time — generally around three to five years — to stop or reduce allergy attacks. Each allergy shot contains a minuscule amount of what you’re allergic to, to stimulate your immune system. Over time, your doctor increases the dose of allergens in each shot to help get your body used to the allergens so that your symptoms diminish. While it’s normally thought of as a treatment for kids, it can be extremely effective in older adults, too. In fact, a 2016 study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma ﻿& Immunology found that immunotherapy reduced symptoms by 55 percent in adults ages 65 to 75 after three years of therapy and decreased the amount of medication patients needed to take by almost two-thirds. Nondrug treatments. McGrath also recommends nondrug treatments such as a nasal saline rinse or neti pot to help to flush allergens and irritants from your nose. (Use them before you spritz a nasal steroid spray to get the best effect.) If you use a neti pot, just remember to use distilled water, not tap water (unless you boil it first), to avoid risk of a dangerous parasitic infection that can spread up into the nose and possibly the brain. Remember, too, that lifestyle steps can help. Keep windows closed during high pollen periods and instead run the air conditioner in your home or car. If you spend time outside, remove your clothes when you come in and shower to rinse pollen from your skin and hair. McGrath also recommends air purifiers with HEPA filters for areas where you spend a lot of time, like your bedroom or living room. These seem like small steps, but they may keep your symptoms at bay enough that you can avoid medication. Drugs that can trigger asthma and allergy-like symptoms Unfortunately, certain medications you may take to control other conditions, such as high blood pressure, can make asthma symptoms worse or trigger allergy-like symptoms in some people. These include: Beta blockers. Drugs such as labetalol or propranolol are often used to treat high blood pressure, heart disease﻿ and migraine. But they can also provoke asthma symptoms in people who have the condition. Your doctor may have to try several different beta blockers to find one that doesn’t worsen your symptoms. ACE inhibitors. Drugs like lisinopril and enalapril, which are used for high blood pressure or heart disease, can cause a cough — including wheezing — in about 10 percent of patients, studies show. This usually resolves once you stop the medication, McGrath says. If you notice this symptom, talk to your doctor. You may be able to switch to a different class of medication. NSAIDs.

Experts say they're usually fine — but here's what to consider when choosing your specs By Sarah Elizabeth Adler, AARP Comments En español Published November 17, 2020 Getty Images Who needs reading glasses? All of us do, eventually, thanks to a condition called presbyopia — a gradual loss of the ability to clearly see things up close — that becomes noticeable for most people beginning in their 40s. Because presbyopia is caused by age-related changes to the lens of the eye, it isn't preventable or reversible. But experts say that the right pair of reading glasses, including those readily available at retailers like a dollar store or pharmacy, can help bring small print and other objects, like your smartphone screen, back into focus. Here's how to find your perfect pair. Over-the-counter reading glasses ""Reading glasses from a drugstore are in fact perfectly safe,” says ophthalmologist Michelle Andreoli, M.D., a clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, who notes that over-the-counter reading glasses, including low-cost dollar store options, can help you focus up close and will not damage your eyesight. But, she adds, once your up-close vision starts changing, you can expect it to continue to worsen into your mid-60s. That means the reading-glass strength you start out with will need to increase as the years go by. “A good rule of thumb is that any strength of [reading glasses] will last someone between 45 and 65 about two years,” Andreoli says. Experts say the best way to determine what strength you need in the first place is with a yearly eye exam, which can tell you what power (notated with a number like +1.00 or +2.50) you need. The higher the number is, the stronger the glasses are. If you haven't been to the eye doctor or want a way to double-check in the store, Andreoli recommends grabbing a greeting card from the stationery aisle to carry out a DIY test: Hold the card at a comfortable reading distance and try on several pairs until you find the ones that work best. If you're stuck between two pairs? “In most cases, when two reading-glass powers seem equally suitable, choose the glasses with the lower power,” says optometrist William Reynolds, president of the American Optometric Association. “Picking reading glasses that are too strong typically will cause more discomfort problems than reading glasses that are a little too weak."" Another thing to keep in mind is the activity you'll be using the reading glasses for. Working on the computer, for example, typically takes place at a greater distance than reading a book, and thus requires a lower strength. Prescription reading glasses The over-the-counter route isn't right for everyone, Reynolds says, including people who have astigmatism (meaning the eye's cornea or lens isn't perfectly round) and those who need a different strength for each eye. In those cases, prescription reading glasses from the eye doctor are a better option. The most popular choice of prescription reading glasses are progressive lenses, Reynolds says. They combine multiple prescriptions in one lens, with a gradual top-to-bottom change, allowing someone to wear just one pair of glasses to correct far-away, middle-distance and up-close vision. For people who otherwise have no vision problems, Andreoli says that reading-glass lenses that are clear (nonprescription) on top are another popular option available from the eye doctor. They can be worn continuously and eliminate the need to take your reading glasses on and off throughout the day. Fredric Grethel, a board member of The Vision Council, a nonprofit optical industry trade association, notes that prescription reading glasses might also be a better choice for someone who wants more options, such as blue-light blocking lenses or an antireflective coating — not to mention a greater selection of fashionable frame choices. ""The world has really changed from some years ago,” Grethel says of the numerous reading-glass options — both over-the-counter and prescription — available today. “Now they're fashionable, they're fun, and they can give you personality.” What’s Your Power? Reading glasses come in a range of powers, depending on the strength that you need. Age and Strength 40-43: +1.00 44-47: +1.25 to +1.50 48-51: +1.50 to +1.75 52-55: +1.75 to +2.00 56-59: +2.00 to +2.25 60-64: +2.25 to +2.50 65+: +2.50 to +3.00 Sarah Elizabeth Adler joined aarp.org as a writer in 2018.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/surprising-fall-risks/,"15 Surprising Things That Can Increase Your Risk of Falling Plus, what you can do to help prevent falls By Merle Myerson, M.D., AARP Comments En español Published January 30, 2025 Getty Images Sandi Preston, a physical therapist, often reminds her 86-year-old mother to use her walker when moving about. But she forgot it one day when stepping out to get the mail. And even though it was a short distance to the mailbox, her mother lost her balance and fell. Each year, more than 14 million adults aged 65 and older fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and about 1 million of them end up hospitalized. However, falls can be prevented. Here are 15 surprising things that can increase your risk of falling, plus advice on how to lower your risk. Risk No. 1: Your medications Medications can keep you healthy, but side effects that can cause dizziness, blurry vision or a delayed reaction time can make you more prone to falling. According to the CDC, some medication categories that can increase your fall risk, include: Psychoactive medications, including antidepressants, opioids, and sedativesAntihistaminesMuscle relaxersBlood pressure medicationsAnticholinergics (used to treat urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, or COPD) Lower your risk: Keep a list of your medications — including your doses and why you are taking each. Don’t forget to include over-the-counter medications and supplements. Then, review your list with your doctor or clinical pharmacist and have them identify and discuss any that could increase your risk of falling. Your health care provider may make some changes, like lowering your dosage or switching to an alternative. Risk No. 2: Diabetes People who have diabetes often have other problems that increase the risk of falling, such as loss of vision (retinopathy) and sensory function (neuropathy). What’s more, medications that control blood sugar can cause levels to go too low (hypoglycemia), making a person light-headed. Other Fall Risks Several other risk factors and home hazards can lead to falls. Some of them include: Area rugs Phone chargers and other cords Poor lighting Clutter Poorly marked curbs and uneven sidewalks A cane, walker or other assistive device can help keep you more independent — and on your feet. A health care provider — your doctor or physical therapist, for example — can help you pick out the right device and adjust it to match your height and needs. Lower your risk: Keep your diabetes in check by attending routine medical appointments, eating a healthy diet, keeping active most days, testing your blood sugar often, managing stress and taking your medications as prescribed. Risk No. 3: Other age-related diseases Parkinson’s disease, stroke, arthritis and peripheral artery disease can also affect your ability to walk and can increase your risk of falling. Lower your risk: If you have one of these conditions, talk to your doctor about doing a fall-risk assessment, which includes a review of your strength, gait, cognition and medications. Risk No. 4: Your pets Man’s best friend can be a fall hazard. Excited pets can jump and knock you over, Preston says. They can also get under foot and push in front of you — especially when you’re trying to get out the door, she adds. A 2009 CDC study found that 86,629 fall injuries each year were associated with cats and dogs. Lower your risk: If a pet is in your way, don’t step over them — make them move, the Ohio Department of Aging recommends, and always check around to see where your pet is before walking near steps. If you don’t feel you can easily handle walking your dog, hire a dog walker or ask a neighbor to help. Consider getting your pet’s energy out at a dog park or in another fenced-in area. In its 2009 report, the CDC also recommends obedience training for dogs. Risk No. 5: Worsening memory As we age, it’s common to have some forgetfulness — Where did I put my glasses? Developing Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia is less common, but when it does occur, symptoms typically start after age 60. When someone has dementia, the brain can have trouble telling the body what to do and how to navigate when walking, putting that person at increased risk of falling. A 2023 study published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, found that nearly half of older adults with dementia experienced one or more falls in 2016, compared to less than one third of older adults without dementia. Lower your risk: In your home, make sure that items you need are easily and readily available. Keeping your daily routine the same can also help reduce your risk of falls. What's more, it's important to discuss any risks with your doctor. Researchers of the 2023 study call for tailored fall-prevention strategies for people with dementia. Other Fall Risks Several other risk factors and home hazards can lead to falls. Some of them include: Area rugs Phone chargers and other cords Poor lighting Clutter Poorly marked curbs and uneven sidewalks A cane, walker or other assistive device can help keep you more independent — and on your feet. A health care provider — your doctor or physical therapist, for example — can help you pick out the right device and adjust it to match your height and needs. Risk No. 6: Changes in vision It’s not unusual for vision to worsen as you age. If left untreated, however, vision impairment can affect your balance and ability to judge distance, increasing your risk of falling. Lower your risk: Adults 65 and older should get their eyes checked every year or two, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends. In addition to routine visits, “any change in vision in one or both eyes should prompt a visit to an eye doctor,” says Laura Kilty, M.D., an ophthalmologist at Bassett Medical Center in Cooperstown, New York. “It is important to be aware that since we have two eyes and use them both at the same time, one may not be aware of a vision change in one eye.” Another key point: “A large percentage of people over 50 wear bifocals, trifocals or progressive lenses to deal with different focusing requirements,” Kilty says. But these lenses make it harder to see the ground below. If you have progressive, bifocal or trifocal lenses, drop your chin when walking downstairs or on uneven surfaces so you are looking through the upper portion of the lenses. “You may want to use glasses with a single-vision lens when walking,” Kilty says. (Read more from AARP: The Hidden Danger of Progressive Lenses) Risk No. 7: Postural hypotension As you go from lying down or sitting to standing, your blood pressure drops, and it can take a second or so for the blood to flow up to your brain. But if your blood pressure drops more than normal — by 20 mmHg or more for the top number of a blood pressure reading, or by 10 mmHg or more for the bottom number — it can take longer for the blood to travel to your brain, and you may feel light-headed. This is called postural hypotension, and it’s something your doctor can test you for in the office. Medications that affect your blood pressure can cause postural hypotension; so can dehydration, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease, among other factors. Lower your risk: Talk to your doctor about the possibility of changing or reducing medications that may be contributing to postural hypotension. Stay hydrated, avoid taking hot baths or showers, and try changing positions from sitting/lying down to standing slowly. Also, don’t forget to make sure you have something to hold on to. Risk No. 8: Hearing loss Hearing and balance are connected — both systems are in the inner ear — which is why hearing loss is often accompanied by balance problems. Lower your risk: If you are having trouble hearing, get hearing aids — and wear them. Researchers at the University of Colorado-Anschutz surveyed adults aged 60 and older who had hearing loss, and found that even those who used their aids for just four hours a day fell less often than those who did not wear them at all. Risk No. 9: Bunions and other foot problems As people get older, foot abnormalities such as bunions, fallen arches and hammer toes become more common, and studies show that these issues can increase a person’s fall risk. Lower your risk: Consider seeing an orthopedist or a podiatrist, who can prescribe orthotics (inserts for your shoes). According to the National Council on Aging, insoles can help older adults maintain their mobility and lower the risk of falling. Risk No. 10: Muscle loss Our muscles lose strength and bulk as we age — a condition known as sarcopenia. This varies from person to person but by age 80 or 90, some adults can lose as much as half of their muscle strength. Lower your risk: The CDC recommends that older adults strength train at least two days a week with free weights, resistance bands, body-weight exercises (push-ups and sit-ups) — even digging in the garden counts. Risk No. 11: Weak bones Not only do bones break more easily if you fall, but research shows that people with osteoporosis — an age-related condition when bones become weak and brittle — have a higher risk of falling. Lower your risk: Incorporate weight-bearing activities into your exercise program. Also, increase your intake of calcium and vitamin D in your diet — dairy, leafy greens and fish like salmon and sardines are rich sources. There’s no need to add a supplement to your routine, unless it’s recommended by your doctor. Research reviewed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has found no conclusive evidence that supplementing with calcium and vitamin D will help prevent falls and fractures. Risk No. 12: You’re walking too slowly You might think walking at a slower pace could help prevent falls. However, research suggests that older adults who walk slow tend to fall more often. Lower your risk: Good footwear (be sure to shop in person and get properly fitted) and aerobic exercise (anything that gets your heart rate up) can help keep you walking at a safe pace. Risk No. 13: Your weight Carrying too much weight can increase your fall risk. One study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine even found where you carry your weight matters: Older adults who carry their weight around their middle had a higher risk of falling than those who carry their weight around their hips, researchers found. At the same time, older adults who are underweight are at higher risk of falling than those at a normal weight. Lower your risk: Work with your doctor to establish a healthy weight for your body type, and adjust your diet and fitness routine to reach and maintain that ideal weight. Your local Office on Aging may be able to help if you have trouble affording nutritious food. (Read more from AARP Foundation: SNAP Benefits for Older Adults) Risk No. 14: An abnormal heart rhythm This can take the form of beating too fast, too slow, or beating irregularly, and can make you feel dizzy and light-headed. Lower your risk: If you feel irregular heartbeats, your doctor can have you wear a heart monitor to help diagnose and treat the problem. Risk No. 15: Having already fallen “Falls, even those without any lasting injuries, can be emotionally traumatic to adults, jarring one's sense of confidence,” says Karin Ouchida, M.D., a geriatrician at The Center on Aging at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. “If any physical or psychological consequences of a fall are not addressed, a person can develop a fear of falling, which actually can increase the risk of a future fall.” Lower your risk: If you’ve had a fall, have a fall assessment with your doctor or another health care provider, like an occupational therapist, to address the causes of your first fall, and lower your risk of another, Ouchida says. An assessment might include: An initial screening to review your medical history and medications, history of falls, possible safety hazards in your home and other potential fall risks.Testing to evaluate balance, gait, strength, vision and hearing.Developing an intervention program to reduce your fall risk. You may be given a specific exercise program and referred for additional therapies and treatments. Merle Myerson, M.D., is a cardiologist who specializes in health lifestyle and disease prevention. She is a board-certified lipid specialist and has authored many research articles and textbooks on cardiovascular disease.","The article explores the risk factors that contribute to falls in adults aged 65 and older, a major health concern affecting over 14 million people annually. Key findings include 15 surprising risk factors, such as certain medications, diabetes, worsening memory, and hearing loss, along with recommendations to mitigate these risks, including reviewing medications, managing chronic conditions, and exercising regularly.

You can keep it in tip-top shape this flu season — which is turning out to be one of the worst in years — if you focus on a plant-based diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods, ﻿Heller says. ﻿ Here are eight foods that nutritionists recommend for flu season. 1. Green tea Whether these particular tea leaves can really fend off the flu has been a source of debate among health researchers for years. But a meta-analysis published in July of 2021 in the journal Molecules looked at more than eight studies involving more than 5,000 participants to conclude there really is ample evidence to believe the beverage — and specifically, the catechins that provide its antioxidant power — can help your immune system fend off influenza. 2. Sweet potatoes﻿ They’re a great source of beta-carotene, a phytonutrient that helps your body make vitamin A. “It supports respiratory health by increasing the number of immune cells in the body,” explains Anna Taylor, lead outpatient clinical dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. This is especially important for older adults, she adds, as our bodies make fewer immune cells as we age. ﻿ Instead of cooking sweet potatoes with butter or brown sugar, Taylor recommends roasting them with olive oil, oregano and black pepper. “You’ll get additional benefits from the spices, but you’re not loading up on sugar and saturated fat﻿, both of which suppress your immune system,” she says. 3. Berries They’re a rich source of vitamin C, which stimulates production of infection﻿-fighting white blood cells, Taylor says. A 2018 review of studies found that berries increased levels of disease﻿-fighting cells in older adults, such as natural killer cells and T-cells. They also contain flavonoids, substances that have antioxidant properties and protect all your cells﻿ —﻿ including your immune system cells﻿ —﻿ from damage, Taylor adds. ﻿ It’s easy to incorporate berries into your diet: ﻿“﻿Add them to your morning yogurt or oatmeal, or even cook them and throw them on your French toast instead of maple syrup,” Taylor recommends. 4. Beans Why ﻿Fluids ﻿Matter if You ﻿Get the ﻿Flu Whether water, electrolyte-rich beverages, broths or green tea (see above), you really do need liquids if you’re sick with the flu. Not only is it important to fend off dehydration, staying hydrated helps you maintain enough circulating blood volume to treat infection. (Just go easy on the caffeinated sodas and coffee.) And yes, doctors say chicken soup can’t hurt, since fever can cause you to lose water as well as salt. Chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans﻿ — ﻿they’re all rich in vitamin B12, a nutrient many older adults are low in, Heller says. “People over the age of 50 don’t absorb vitamin B12 as well in their body, but your immune system needs it to fight disease and repair damaged cells to keep you healthy,” Heller explains. ﻿ Beans are also high in zinc, which helps boost your body’s production of white blood cells, Taylor says. “Zinc deficiency has been linked to immune system dysfunction,” she says. Taylor recommends at least a half a cup of cooked beans three times a week﻿. ﻿You can throw them into soups, salads or even rice dishes﻿. ﻿For a healthy crunchy snack, roast chickpeas in some olive oil. 5. Nuts and seeds These foods are rich in vitamin E, which plays a key role in your immune system by supporting the growth of germ-fighting T-cells, says Lauri Wright, ﻿director of nutrition programs at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. They’re also a good source of omega-6 fatty acids. Walnuts are an especially good choice, as research shows they have a very positive effect on your gut microbiome, says clinical nutritionist Kate Cohen. They also have more alpha-linolenic acid﻿ — an essential fatty acid important for immune function﻿ — than any other type of nut. 6. Salmon Why ﻿Fluids ﻿Matter if You ﻿Get the ﻿Flu Whether water, electrolyte-rich beverages, broths or green tea (see above), you really do need liquids if you’re sick with the flu. Not only is it important to fend off dehydration, staying hydrated helps you maintain enough circulating blood volume to treat infection. (Just go easy on the caffeinated sodas and coffee.) And yes, doctors say chicken soup can’t hurt, since fever can cause you to lose water as well as salt. It’s ﻿not plant﻿-based, but it is one of the few foods that provides vitamin D, which plays a huge role in regulating your immune system, says Jennifer McDaniel, owner of McDaniel Nutrition Therapy in Clayton, Missouri. A 2020 study published in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people who had untreated vitamin D deficiency were almost twice as likely to test positive for COVID-19 ﻿as patients who had sufficient levels of the vitamin. A 6-ounce salmon filet has about 600 international units (IU﻿) of vitamin D, which is close to the 800 IU that﻿ is recommended daily for people 70 and older. Another bonus: ﻿It’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have also been shown to strengthen your immune system. If you’re not a fan of fish, McDaniel suggests marinating it in brown sugar and Dijon mustard for 45 minutes, then throwing it on the grill. “It mellows out that fishy taste, and it gives it a smoky flavor,” she explains. Canned salmon counts, too: ﻿Throw it over a salad for a quick meal, she says. ﻿ 7. Garlic It’s rich in a compound called alliin, which may be the source of its immune﻿-boosting properties, notes Libby Mills, a Philadelphia-based nutritionist. A 2020 review published in the journal Medical Hypotheses found that garlic itself seems to stimulate cells related to immune system function. Another study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that people given about 2½ grams of aged garlic extract for 90 days not only had higher levels of immune system cells, but they also had fewer symptoms of cold and flu, and missed fewer workdays due to these respiratory illnesses, than a control group. At the very least, if you eat enough of it, you’ll probably keep people away from you, Mills jokes. Although there’s probably not enough research to support taking a garlic supplement, Mills recommends that you cook with it in the colder winter months. You can make your own pasta sauce with tomatoes and garlic, since vitamin C (found in tomatoes) is itself an antioxidant that helps the immune system she says. 8. Kefir Research, including a 2021 study published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, suggests that certain compounds found in fermented dairy such as kefir (which is like a thin yogurt) have anti-inflammatory properties that can help the immune system fight viral infections. The probiotics found in kefir and other fermented foods also help to calm chronic inflammation, according to Harvard Health. “Fermented dairy is rich in probiotics, which seem to have a positive effect on the immune system,” Mills explains.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/how-to-sleep-through-the-night/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series 6 Simple Strategies for Sleeping Through the Night Tips for getting the deep, refreshing slumber you need, and for getting back to sleep when you wake in the wee hours Getty Images By Kimberly Goad, AARP En español Published March 23, 2023 Don’t believe the short sleepers. Those one-percenters — Martha Stewart and Elon Musk, among them — all claim to get by just fine on less than six hours of sleep a night. But sleep is meant to repair and restore, and research shows that unless you’re among the 1 percent with the “short sleeper” gene, you need at least seven hours a night to make that happen. No surprise, many of us — 1 in 3 — aren’t logging that many hours, and if we are, we aren’t doing so consistently or without waking throughout the night. That’s especially true as we age and begin to experience a shift in how we cycle through the different stages of sleep — what sleep experts call “sleep architecture.” “As we get older, our sleep becomes more shallow and broken up, and the amount of deep sleep decreases somewhat,” explains Michael Grandner, director of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona College of Medicine Tucson. “This may be due to more sleep disrupters and medical issues interfering with our ability to get deep sleep, or it may just be a natural part of aging. We also tend to get more interruptions to sleep, for longer periods of time, as we get older.” Whatever the exact reason, the cumulative effect goes way beyond simply feeling tired and foggy-headed the next day. Research shows that chronic sleep deprivation accelerates the aging process. According to a recent study in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, chronic insufficient sleep can negatively affect immune cells, which may lead to inflammatory disorders and heart disease. The study also found that catching up on sleep — say, on the weekends — doesn’t reverse the damage. Another study, published in PLOS Medicine, analyzed the impact of sleep duration on the health of almost 8,000 men and women at the ages of 50, 60 and 70. Researchers looked at the relationship between how long each participant slept, mortality and whether they had been diagnosed with two or more chronic diseases — such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes — over the course of 30 years. People who reported getting five hours of sleep or less at age 50 were ﻿30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with at least two chronic diseases over 30 years, compared to people who slept for up to seven hours. But that doesn’t mean staying healthy is contingent upon sleeping through the night without ever waking up. Uninterrupted sleep isn’t realistic, says Chris Winter, M.D., a neurologist, sleep expert and author of The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How to Fix It. Although we may not realize it, “humans wake up during the night a lot — probably 15 times every hour, and this number tends to grow as we age,” says Winter, who works with professional athletes to help them improve their sleep habits. “Waking up once or twice during the night does not mean your sleep is ruined. Every NBA player I work with wakes up once or twice to go to the bathroom at night, and they still score 15 points the next day and grab four rebounds.” We go right back to sleep after most of those short awakenings, but sometimes we wake up and stay awake. So it isn’t the waking up that’s (necessarily) the problem. It’s the going back to sleep that can be tricky. Keep reading for tips on how to improve your chances of making that happen. 1. Set a regular bedtime (and stick with it) Your chances of getting a good night’s sleep begin the night before. That’s right. The most important thing you can do in the name of getting a good night’s sleep is to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. What experts call good sleep hygiene “incorporates many different aspects, beginning with keeping to regular bedtimes and wake times, regardless of how the day went,” says Jing Wang, M.D., associate professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Also important: “Protect the bedroom for sleep or sex only,” she adds. “You want to create a relaxing environment — quiet, cool and dark.” To that end, lower the thermostat slightly, close the blinds and “take the clock out of the bedroom or cover it so you don’t see it.” It’s a matter of heated debate among animal lovers, but having pets in your bed can disturb sleep. 2. Avoid long naps Nothing wrong with a daytime nap. Research suggests it can improve overall well-being in a number of ways. The secret is to keep naps short, ideally 20 minutes and no longer than 30. Otherwise, they can interfere with nighttime sleeping. “Naps are like sleep snacks,” says Grandner. “A light snack in the middle of the day can be great for health and give an energy boost. But constant, excessive snacking might be a sign of a problematic diet. It’s the same with naps. Planned naps in the middle of the day can be very helpful. But unplanned naps due to sleep deprivation may not solve the problem of poor nighttime sleep.” 3. Exercise Mounting research shows a strong relationship between sleep and physical activity, whether it’s a walk around the block or an all-out sweat session at the gym. Each plays a role in the success of the other. “Exercise is the one thing that truly improves sleep quality and quantity,” says Winter. 4. Avoid fluids after the early p.m. Nocturia — otherwise known as waking during the night to pee — is incredibly common among older people. Research suggests half of adults ages 50 to 79 make two or more trips to the bathroom per night. The reasons? Age-related changes in the urinary system along with a variety of hormonal changes. Research shows that hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea and obesity also play a significant role. The solution? Reduce fluid intake in the mid and late evening, especially of caffeinated beverages and alcohol, which can act as diuretics. Pelvic floor exercises may also help. 5. Power down It isn’t just that the TV series you’re streaming is stimulating or the games on your phone keep your brain buzzing. The blue light that’s emitted from these and other electronic devices is like a calling card for insomnia, boosting mood and alertness by slowing the production of melatonin — the sleep hormone — in the body. Turn off all tech “at the very least an hour, ideally two to three hours,” before you slip between the sheets, Wang says. 6. Get out of bed You’ve counted sheep, dogs, cats, the number of times your grandkids watched Paddington during their weekend stay, and still you can’t fall back to sleep. “Awakenings are often followed by a period of unavoidable wakefulness ­— our mind or body is just too activated to return to sleep,” says Grandner. “The best thing to do is get out of bed and do something else to pass the time until the mind and body are ready to try again. Lingering in bed often backfires and creates stress around sleep.” But that’s not to say a bout of insomnia is license to grab your phone off the nightstand and go googling. The American Association of Sleep Medicine gives the green light to anything that isn’t stimulating, whether it’s knitting, drawing or reading. If you have no choice but to log on to your computer or pick up your phone, keep a pair of blue-light-blocking glasses handy, and be sure the lenses are orange or red. A study published in 2022 in the Journal of Biological and Medical Rhythm Research looked at 50 pairs of blue-light-blocking glasses and found that the orange and red lenses blocked virtually all the light that impacts circadian rhythms and sleep. “Blue-light-blocking glasses are great to use during middle-of-the-night wakings,” says Grandner, lead author of the study. If none of the above helps and “your sleep problems are interfering with your ability to function or are contributing to health or mental health problems, seek out a sleep specialist to see if you might have a sleep disorder,” Grandner suggests. “Sleep disorders are highly treatable — most don’t even require sleeping pills or other medications.” Is melatonin a good idea? You could be forgiven for thinking of melatonin as a sleeping pill, given its proximity to over-the-counter medications and supplements at the pharmacy. Melatonin is actually a hormone produced naturally by the body. Its production ramps up at night, promoting sleep and helping to orient your circadian rhythm, the body’s sleep-wake cycle. The melatonin that comes in a bottle is a synthetic version of that hormone. The question is: Are melatonin supplements — whether regular or extended release — effective for middle-of-the-night awakenings? “In general, we do not recommend taking melatonin, but may consider it depending on a patient’s individual situation,” says Wang, echoing the findings of a review of studies recently published in Clinical Interventions in Aging. “Because it is a nonprescription medication, we worry about inadvertent inappropriate dosing/timing, so we prefer to discuss individualized plan for use.” For more about this popular supplement, see Melatonin for Sleep, Does It Work and Is It Safe?

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/pecan-health-benefits/,"Comparing the Health Benefits of Nuts Nature's snack offers diverse tastes and nutritional values Even a small portion of nuts offers a powerful punch of nutrition. Getty Images By: Kim Hayes, AARP En español Published November 06, 2017 Squirrels are clearly smarter than we give them credit for — their favorite food offers a wealth of health benefits. Nuts are a convenient, healthy and tasty snack that offers benefits such as fiber, plant protein, good fats, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. While the grams of fat per serving in nuts may scare off dieters, a majority of the fat grams in mixed nut products are from beneficial monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, according to WebMD. Additionally, every ounce contains roughly 5 grams of protein. While you should still be conscious of portions — most experts recommend a handful or so as a serving — nuts are packed with healthy calories. But which ones are the best? It depends on what you are looking for and how much you are willing to pay. Raw vs. oil-roasted Going raw gives you the best overall health benefits with the lowest calorie count, but not by much, Prevention.com reports, based on data from the USDA's National Nutrient Database. A study comparing raw and oil-roasted cashews found that oil-roasted are only slightly higher in calories, and they offer the same nutritional benefits such as protein, fiber and folate. Raw have a slight advantage in iron and magnesium content, but roasted are still super-healthy. So go ahead and indulge, just make sure they are cooked in organic oil and only lightly salted, according to Prevention. Peanuts vs. tree nuts Tree nuts such as almonds and walnuts are considered the nut elite and are prized for their vitamins, minerals and healthy fat content , reports the Harvard Health Blog. But on the downside, they tend to be a bit pricey. Thankfully a 2015 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that the much more affordable peanut, which is actually a legume, offers the same nutritional values as its pricier tree friends, particularly for heart health. ""Consumption of nuts, particularly peanuts given their general affordability, may be considered a cost-effective measure to improve cardiovascular health,"" the study reported. Go nuts for variety If you can afford the slightly more pricey snack, tree nuts offer unique health benefits as well as flavors. Small studies have found that almonds may help reduce risk factors for heart disease and diabetes, Healthline.com reported. Additionally, pistachios offer high fiber values and may reduce blood sugar levels and risk factors for high blood pressure and weight gain. Large studies also found that eating walnuts significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, while increasing ""good"" HDL cholesterol, according to Healthline. Brazil nuts, which originate from the Amazon, are a rich source of selenium, a mineral that acts as an antioxidant and can help reduce cholesterol and inflammation levels, although they are high in calories and only small amounts are needed to get the benefits. Don't pass on pecans Despite being the go-to ingredients for decadent desserts, pecans themselves are quite healthy.﻿ Istock Some people avoid pecans because they are often associated with indulgent desserts, such as pecan pie and pralines, nutritionist Cynthia Sass writes for Health.com. But on their own, pecans offer unique nutritional perks, including high levels of antioxidants that have been tied to heart benefits. ""Compared to other nuts, pecans also have the highest levels of gamma-tocopherols, which is a form of vitamin E and another key antioxidant."" Pecans are an excellent source of thiamin and zinc, as well as manganese and copper, according to Sass. Manganese helps with blood sugar levels and healthy bones, and copper aids in iron absorption and immunity. Pecans also offer a bit of extra sweetness, yet contain only 1 gram of sugar, making them a great addition to a variety of dishes. Despite being the go-to ingredients for decadent desserts, pecans themselves are quite healthy.﻿ Istock Kim Hayes is a senior producer for AARP and has written on social justice issues for numerous organizations﻿, including the National Organization for Women, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights﻿ Under Law.﻿ She served as editor of the Native American Report newsletter.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

The article explores the health benefits of nuts, a nutritious snack that offers a range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Key findings suggest that both raw and oil-roasted nuts are healthy options, with peanuts being a cost-effective alternative to tree nuts like almonds and walnuts, which offer unique health benefits such as reducing heart disease risk and improving cholesterol levels. A surprising insight is that pecans, often associated with indulgent desserts, are actually a nutrient-rich snack that offers high levels of antioxidants and essential minerals like zinc and manganese. Overall, the article recommends incorporating a variety of nuts into one's diet for optimal health benefits.",205
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/coronavirus-facts/,"What Older Adults Need to Know About COVID-19 Stay up to date with news on vaccines, treatments, long COVID and more By Rachel Nania, Updated October 24, 2024 AARP En español Published January 28, 2020 / Updated October 24, 2024 With the pandemic in its fifth year, staying informed about the latest developments with the disease, including new variants and treatments, remains especially important for older adults, who are most at risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19. ​ Here’s a summary of recent coronavirus news that’s particularly relevant to people 50 and older, followed by answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about COVID-19. Latest COVID-19 news﻿ Older adults should get a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the spring. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that adults 65 and older and those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised get a second dose of the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine six months after their first dose, which for many, will be in the spring. ﻿""The recommendation acknowledges the increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19 in older adults and those who are immunocompromised, along with the currently available data on vaccine effectiveness and year-round circulation of COVID-19,"" the CDC said in a statement. Previous COVID-19 infection can increase risk of heart attack, stroke.﻿ A study led by researchers at Cleveland Clinic and the University of Southern California, and published in the journal led by researchers at Cleveland Clinic and the University of Southern California, and published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, found that a history of COVID-19 can double the risk of heart attack, stroke or death. The risk, which remains for up to three years after a COVID-19 diagnosis, was significantly higher for patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The study also found that people with a blood type other an O were twice as likely to experience an adverse cardiovascular event after COVID-19 than those with an O blood type. “These findings reveal while it’s an upper respiratory tract infection, COVID-19 has a variety of health implications and underscores that we should consider history of prior COVID-19 infection when formulating cardiovascular disease preventive plans and goals,” study coauthor Stanley Hazen, M.D., said in a news release. Older adults remain at higher risk for COVID complications. A report from the CDC finds that from October 2023 to April 2024, adults 65 and older accounted for 70 percent of COVID-related hospitalizations. Most hospitalized adults had two or more underlying health conditions, and the majority were not up to date with their COVID-19 vaccine, the researchers found. Updated COVID vaccines are available. COVID-19 vaccines that have been updated to target more recently circulating versions of the coronavirus have been given the green light by the Food and Drug Administration and are available at pharmacies and clinics nationwide. The mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, target the KP.2 variant of the virus, and the protein-based vaccine from Novavax targets JN.1, the parent strain of KP.2 and other FLiRT variants. All three vaccines are expected to provide good protection as we head into respiratory virus season, and it’s recommended that everyone ages 6 months and older receive one this fall. Free at-home tests available again. The federal government relaunched the free at-home testing program. Each U.S. household is able to order four free coronavirus tests from COVIDtests.gov. Shipping is free, and the tests will be able to detect current COVID-19 variants. ﻿COVID-19 was the 10th leading cause of death last year. COVID-19 was the 10th leading cause of death in 2023, dropping from fourth place in 2022, a report from the CDC finds. During 2023, COVID caused or contributed to 76,446 deaths in the U.S., compared with 245,614 in 2022. COVID death rates decreased for all demographic groups from 2022 to 2023, but they continued to remain highest among people 85 and older. Frequently Asked Questions How can you catch COVID-19? ​​Who is at risk for COVID-19? ​What can you do to reduce your risk? Do the vaccines have side effects? What are the symptoms of COVID-19? What should I know about testing? ​What should you do if you get sick?​​ Are there treatments?​​ What are the variants? What is long COVID? How can you catch COVID-19? ​​COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. You can catch COVID-19 by breathing in air if you are close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus. You can get it if those small droplets and particles land in your eyes, nose or mouth (likely through coughs or sneezes) or if you have virus particles on your hands and touch your eyes, nose or mouth.​​ ​​Who is at risk for COVID-19? Anyone can get COVID-19, but some people are more at risk for what experts call “severe disease” that may require hospitalization or intensive care. ​​ Older adults are more likely than younger, healthier people to experience serious illness from COVID-19. The vast majority of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have occurred among people 50 or older — and the risk increases with age. ​​ Adults of any age with an underlying medical condition are at increased risk for complications from a coronavirus infection. Among the factors: ​​ Cancer Chronic kidney disease Chronic lung diseases, including COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), asthma (moderate to severe), interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension Dementia or other neurological conditions Diabetes (type 1 or type 2) Down syndrome Heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies or hypertension) HIV infection Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) Liver disease Mental health conditions, including depression and schizophrenia spectrum disorders Overweight and obesity (defined as a body mass index of 25 or greater) Pregnancy Sickle cell disease or thalassemia Smoking (current or former) Solid organ or blood stem cell transplant (includes bone marrow transplants) Stroke or cerebrovascular disease, which affects blood flow to the brain Substance use disorders (such as alcohol, opioid or cocaine use disorder) Tuberculosis ​What can you do to reduce your risk? ​There are a number of ways you can reduce your risk of getting sick from COVID-19. Chief among them: get vaccinated. The FDA has officially approved two vaccines — from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — and both have been updated to target more recent versions of the virus. The FDA has issued an emergency-use authorization (EUA) for an updated COVID-19 vaccine developed by Novavax for people 12 and older. ﻿All three vaccines are effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19, and health officials are encouraging everyone 6 months and older to get vaccinated. A few other ways to lower the likelihood of getting sick from COVID-19: Wear a high-quality face mask when you’re in public indoor settings, avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and wash your hands often. Do the vaccines have side effects? It’s common to experience mild to moderate side effects after getting vaccinated, such as soreness in the arm, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, fever or chills — but these are temporary “and normal signs that your body is building protection,” the CDC says. ​​A small number of vaccine recipients have experienced adverse reactions to the shots. These serious events after COVID-19 vaccination “are rare but may occur,” the CDC says. Anaphylaxis, an allergic reaction, has occurred in a small share of the vaccinated population — approximately five cases per 1 million doses administered. This is why you may be asked to wait about 15 minutes after your shot or booster to monitor for symptoms. Vaccine providers are equipped with medicines to quickly treat the reaction. ​​ Health officials are monitoring reports of myocarditis or pericarditis in some adolescents and younger adults after vaccination with the Pfizer﻿,﻿ Moderna and Novavax vaccines. Most of these patients who received care responded well to medicine and felt better quickly, the CDC says. ​It’s also monitoring rare reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome, which was more commonly associated with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which is no longer available. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms that typically appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, including: ​ Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache Loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea This list is not exhaustive, and more unusual symptoms have been noted throughout the pandemic — from cognitive complications to skin rashes. ​​ Most people with COVID-19 can recover at home. However, if you develop emergency warning signs — pain or pressure in the chest; disorientation or confusion; pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds; difficulty breathing; or an inability to wake or stay awake — get medical attention immediately. ​​ What should I know about testing? Testing can help keep you and others around you safe. If you’re experiencing symptoms, test yourself. At-home tests are available at many pharmacies and community health centers.. You can search for free testing options at testinglocator.cdc.gov. ​What should you do if you get sick?​​ If your test is positive, talk to your doctor right away about treatments that can help keep you out of the hospital. These treatments work best when started right away, so don’t delay. (See the following section for more details.) If you have COVID-19, it’s important to stay home and separate yourself from others while you are sick. New recommendations suggest returning to normal activities when symptoms are improving and you’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medication. At that point, masks and other preventive efforts are encouraged for at least five days. Are there treatments?​​ Yes. A few medications are available to treat COVID-19, though this list changes as new variants emerge. With the current batch of omicron subvariants circulating, three treatments are available to patients in the U.S.: Paxlovid, a prescription oral antiviral pill Veklury (remdesivir), an antiviral medication given by IV Lagevrio (molnupiravir), a prescription oral antiviral pill The FDA has also authorized a pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) medication, called Pemgarda, for people with immune compromising conditions that may not generate an adequate response to the vaccine. If you test positive for COVID-19 and are over the age of 50 or have medical conditions that put you at higher risk for severe illness, talk to your doctor right away about treatment options. What are the variants? Public health officials have identified several new strains of the coronavirus, some of which are more contagious and may cause more severe illness. In the U.S., the biggest variant of concern is omicron and its descendants. Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have vaccines that better target these more recent versions of the coronavirus, and everyone age 6 months and older is encouraged to get one. What is long COVID? Many COVID-19 survivors battle lingering symptoms for weeks or months after infection, even if the initial infection was mild or asymptomatic. Sometimes called “long-haulers,” they suffer from dizziness, insomnia, confusion, a racing heart or a host of other lasting effects that keep them from getting back to their normal lives. ​​A report published by the CDC found that as many as 1 in 4 older adults with COVID-19 had new or lingering symptoms. ​​ Experts encourage COVID-19 patients experiencing long COVID to seek care from a medical provider. Several U.S. hospitals and research centers have set up special clinics and rehabilitation services for survivors.​ Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability.

You aren’t alone. Almost half of those 50 and older feel the same way, according to an AARP survey. But building muscle and getting the physical activity that health experts say all adults need is easier than you may have thought. You can break movement into short bursts that health experts call exercise snacks, and still get many of the benefits of exercising and lifting weights, without leaving your home or buying gym equipment. “When experts say you should be getting 150 minutes of exercise a week and strength training two times per week, I think that can [sound] scary,” says Katie Wadland, a board certified geriatric clinical specialist and owner of Healthy Aging Physical Therapy based in Wakefield, Mass. “So, break it down.” A few minutes, real results The benefit of exercise snacks has emerged from years of research on short, intense exercises. In 2022, researchers in the United Kingdom published one of the largest studies to date in the journal Nature Medicine on middle-aged adults, showing how brief bouts of vigorous exercise can improve cardiovascular health. The study concluded that people between the ages of 40 and 69 who engaged in spurts of movement for at least one to two minutes, three times a day, significantly reduced the risk of death from heart disease or cancer, compared with those who weren’t physically active at all.

Read more about the joy of pickleball Another recent study looked at how short, intensive exercise snacks might help to offset muscle loss during aging. Oliver Perkin, a University of Bath postdoctoral researcher in exercise physiology, led the study of healthy but nonexercising adults and the impact of getting up and down from a chair for at least one minute, twice a day, over four weeks. “We saw some pretty encouraging results in terms of increase in muscle size and strength in older adults,” he says of study participants. “We think the weight of the body on the person’s legs was enough to build strength.” Building muscle With aging, the body’s processing of nutrients begins to slow, making it harder to build muscle tissue. On average, adults lose﻿ about 30 percent of their muscle power between the ages of 50 and 70. Inactivity can hasten that muscle loss. Scientists say the brief bouts of activity encourage muscle fibers to grow and improves the efficiency of how muscles use amino acids needed to repair and restore muscle mass. “We think, over time, activity snacks could delay the loss of muscle mass that occurs with aging,” says Daniel Moore, associate professor of muscle physiology at the University of Toronto, who is currently leading a study on activity snacks and older adults. Simple ways to get moving To get started, Wadland suggests tying an exercise snack to a daily habit in certain rooms, such as doing a plank in the kitchen while waiting for the coffee to brew or doing a one-legged balancing move while brushing your teeth in the bathroom. You can even place sticky notes in each room to remind you to do the movement. Another strategy is to set a timer to do each snack at a certain time, like 9 am, noon and 5 pm. “Linking it to something you are already doing can be a great way to adapt these exercise snacks to your day,” she said. There are multiple options for exercise snacks, so Wadland says to pick movements that you like the most. Here are five examples of exercise snacks that you can do for one minute each. Each includes a way to increase the challenge to your body’s muscles. Please check with your doctor first before doing any new exercise. Five One-Minute Workouts Archie Israel, a trainer and medical exercise specialist in the Washington, DC, area who works with clients age 50 and over, ﻿helped design this workout and models the exercises below. He recommends starting with just a few reps and adding over time to create a daily habit. Eli Meir Kaplan 1. Chair sit to stand Make sure you are sitting on a sturdy chair that won’t move when you do. Shift your body to the edge of the chair, legs shoulder-width apart. Lean your weight a bit towards the balls of your feet and come to standing, back straight, knees above the feet, weight on the whole foot and then sit back down. Repeat. Eli Meir Kaplan Extra credit: Begin standing in front of the chair, and squat as you if you were going to sit in it. Just before you sit, stand back up. Eli Meir Kaplan 2. Counter Plank While standing, position yourself a few feet from the counter. Keep your feet a few inches apart. Put palms on counter, about shoulder-width apart from one another. Allow the body to lean toward the edge of the counter, drawing your shoulder blades slightly toward one another and hold. Extra credit: Walk your feet away from the counter, or perform the plank on the floor. Eli Meir Kaplan Eli Meir Kaplan Eli Meir Kaplan Eli Meir Kaplan 3. Heel to toe lifts Stand behind a chair and hold on to it for support. Raise your heels off the floor until you are standing on the balls of your feet. Slowly lower your heels back to the floor. Repeat. Eli Meir Kaplan Extra credit: Take hands off the chair. As you lift your heels, lift your arms overhead and alongside your ears. Slowly lower arms and heels back to the floor. Repeat. Eli Meir Kaplan 4. Marches Slide forward in a chair with your back straight. And “run” in place, lifting one knee and then the other as fast as you can. Eli Meir Kaplan Extra credit: Stand behind the back of the chair and place your hands on the chair for support. Lifting one knee as high as you can, balance on your opposite leg. Repeat on the other side and then march as fast as you can in place. Eli Meir Kaplan 5. One-legged balance Stand behind the back of a sturdy, unmoving chair, or the edge of a countertop in the kitchen. Place hands on top of the chair or the counter. Place your weight slightly more on one leg (right or left, it doesn’t matter which you start with) and lift the heel of the opposite leg and hold for a minute. Repeat on other leg. Eli Meir Kaplan Extra credit: If you feel steady on the standing leg, begin to lift the whole foot of the opposite leg, then work your way toward balancing without the support of one hand and then without either hand and hold for a minute. Repeat on other leg. Building Up Over Time Researchers say the key to gaining the most benefit from exercise snacks is to do them consistently and throughout your week. Over time, the movement snacks will add up. If you do them enough times, you can reach the recommended health guidelines for physical activity. Here’s one way: 5 snack workouts X 1 minute each (1-minute rest time between) X 7 = 35 minutes The more often you do them, the more you’ll gain in physical fitness.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/how-to-reduce-microplastics/#comments_widget_id,"7 Ways to Trim Microplastics from Your Life It’s impossible to get rid of them all, but you can cut back substantially with the right changes By Katherine Hobson, AARP Comments En español Published April 17, 2025 Paul Spella The more researchers look for microplastics in the human body, the more they find them. The tiny fragments are released when larger plastic items break down in the environment and when they’re shed from plastic-containing packaging or materials during use. Increasingly, researchers are showing that microplastics can make their way into the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and elsewhere. What isn’t clear is whether they pose a health threat to people. Researchers reported recently that levels of plastic in the brain were higher in people who had dementia than in those who didn’t, but they don’t know whether the plastic contributes to dementia risk or if changes seen in dementia make the brain more susceptible to microplastic accumulation. In 2024, researchers found jagged microplastics and even tinier nanoplastics in the plaques in some people’s carotid arteries, and those people had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke or death, according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. In 2024, researchers published a review of evidence, mostly animal studies, that found exposure to microplastics is “suspected” to harm human digestive and respiratory health, including a potential link to colon and lung cancer. It’s “highly probable” that microplastics could harm human health, says Philip Kuriakose, M.D., a hematologist and medical oncologist at the Henry Ford Cancer Institute in Detroit. “But it hasn’t been fully proven yet.” The potential for health problems is particularly relevant for older adults, whose bodies are less able to repair the harm that plastics (and the chemicals they may contain) can do to the body, Kuriakose says. Exposure to microplastics could exacerbate existing health problems that are more common with age, such as heart disease and possibly vascular dementia, he says. Microplastics are everywhere – they’ve even been detected on Mount Everest – and it’s not practical to avoid them entirely. “We’re never going to be able to eliminate plastic exposures, and in some cases, we shouldn’t, because there’s a risk-benefit ratio for everything, and there are benefits of plastics,” says Douglas Walker, an associate professor in the Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health at Emory University, who studies microplastics. “But I do think we should have mindfulness about our plastic use.” Here are some relatively easy lifestyle changes that can help reduce your exposure, the researchers say: 1. Cut back on single-use plastics. Plastic pollution accumulates in the environment – including the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. You can do your part by following Walker’s top recommendation: Choose alternatives to the plastics you use once and then toss, such as plastic wrap, bags, cutlery and food and beverage containers, whenever possible. 2. Opt for water from the faucet rather than bottled. If you have access to clean tap water, it’s a better choice than buying bottled, says Britta Baechler, marine biologist and director of ocean plastics research at the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. One 2024 study found that an average liter of bottled water contained 240,000 tiny pieces of plastic, 90 percent of them the extremely tiny nanoplastics. While tap water also contains microplastics, bottled water has more, research has shown. That seems to be true even for water sold in glass bottles, suggesting microplastic particles are getting into the water through the packaging process, she says. “For me, that’s evidence to suggest that tap water is best for both you and the planet,” Baechler says. When you’re on the go, fill up a reusable stainless steel or glass bottle. Home-based water filtration is also an option. Look for a filter that has NSF/ANSI 401 certification, which means it can reduce the amount of microplastics in your water.

Learn, take action, build healthy habits 3. Don’t mix plastic containers and heat. Walker says he stores and heats up leftovers in a glass container rather than a plastic one. And when he buys foods meant to be heated up in their single-use plastic packaging, he transfers them to a microwave-safe dish or bowl, and then heats them. Some foods shouldn’t even be stored in plastic. For example, it’s a good idea not to store oil-rich foods in plastic containers or to let them come into contact with plastic wrap because the oil can cause the plastic to leach into food, Walker says. 4. Extend that caution to hot beverages. When your barista hands you coffee in a disposable cup, it’s most likely lined with plastic, even if it’s primarily made of paper. When hot liquid hits that plastic, it releases microplastics into your drink, research has found. Bring your own reusable, non-plastic cup, instead. (Bonus: Some coffee shops will give you a small discount if you BYOC.) Are you a tea drinker? Recent studies have pointed out micro and nanoplastics found in teabags, which can leach particles into the tea. Those kinds of findings “made me change my tea-drinking habits,” Baechler says. “I now use looseleaf tea in a reusable stainless-steel steeper.” 5. Look for alternatives to plastic cutting boards and cooking utensils. Chopping food on plastic cutting boards is a potentially “substantial” source of microplastics in food, according to a study reported in 2023 from the University of North Dakota. Other options include boards made of glass, marble, bamboo or wood. (Just be sure you understand how to clean and care for them properly.) Plastic cooking utensils such as spatulas can also be swapped out for metal or silicone. Don’t feel you have to get rid of everything in your kitchen immediately. “I do a little bit at a time, and then eventually I’ve taken a lot of [plastic] things out of my life,” says Tracey Woodruff, M.D., a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive sciences at UC San Francisco and an author of the 2024 review of evidence on microplastics and health. 6. Focus on minimally processed foods. You may have heard a lot about plastics in the ocean – more than 8 million tons of plastic flow from rivers and beaches into the ocean every year, according to the UN Environment Program, and that plastic is gobbled up by the seafood we eat. But fish and shellfish aren’t the only protein source of microplastics. A study published in 2024 looked at 16 types of protein that people commonly eat, including fish and shellfish, pork, beef and chicken, and plant-based proteins such as tofu and meat replacements. “We found there’s no difference in concentration of microplastics,” says Baechler, an author on that study. She and colleagues found at least some microplastics in 88 percent of the samples. One way to trim back on the microplastics you eat: steer clear of processed foods, which had more microplastics than lightly processed foods, Baechler says. And when you shop, try to avoid plastic packaging when possible, Kuriakose says. 7. Vacuum and leave your shoes at the door. We inhale plastic particles indoors and out. In your home, a vacuum with a HEPA filter can get rid of some of the microplastics, which are present in dust, says Woodruff. Removing shoes at the door also cuts down on tracked-in dust from outdoors, she says. Synthetic fabrics can produce tiny plastic fibers, and dryers seem to disperse those into the air, one study found. To be on the safe side, when you pull the lint filter out of the dryer, clean it out directly over a trash bin and keep it as contained as possible, Baechler says. You can also buy fewer clothes made with synthetic fibers, to the degree that that’s practical. Bonus tip: Make yourself resilient in other ways. While you’re being mindful about your exposures, you can shore up your own defenses against all potential threats to your health, Woodruff says. That means adopting habits like a healthy diet, regular exercise, sufficient sleep and not smoking.

A novel insight is that even seemingly minor actions, like removing shoes at the door and using a HEPA-filter vacuum, can help minimize microplastic exposure.",208
https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/elderberry-for-cold-and-flu/,"Can Elderberry Cure Your Cold Symptoms? The supplements are marketed as an immune-boosting remedy, but like all pills and potions, can come with risks for some By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published February 19, 2025 Getty Images You’re laid low by a fever, chills, runny nose, congestion. Can elderberry deliver relief? Thanks to what are believed to be the herbal supplement’s immune-boosting superpowers (the tiny purple berry is loaded with vitamins and antioxidants), elderberry is having something of a moment. A growing number of people are reaching for elderberry juice, syrup, gummies, capsules, tea and tablets to help them power their way through a cold or the flu, while others are simply looking to reap the perceived health benefits. All, despite the fact that high-quality research into whether elderberry actually helps prevent and treat common respiratory infections is lacking, and the small studies that do exist are far from conclusive. Complicating matters, elderberry supplements — like all herbal supplements — are not subjected to the same rigorous testing, manufacturing and labeling standards as prescription and over-the-counter medications. For example, the label on an herbal supplement can include broad promises about the product’s impact on the body — that it “reduces stress” or “promotes digestive comfort.” And unlike highly scrutinized prescription and over-the-counter medications, standardization with supplements is lacking. “Unlike with pharmaceutical drugs, there’s no requirement that botanicals need to be prepared in any standardized way,” says Pieter Cohen, M.D., an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who studies supplement safety. “What we’ve found when we analyze botanical supplements is that the amount of active compound varies widely from one brand to another. So when you go to the store and buy elderberry, you have no idea what you’re getting.” What is elderberry? According to The Plant Humanities Lab, the dark violet-black berry’s beginning as a go-to for colds and flu dates back to 400 B.C. That’s when Hippocrates — the Greek physician known as the “father of medicine” — called the elder plant his “medicine chest” because of the many health woes it seemed to treat — from constipation to hemorrhoids to insect bites and upper respiratory infections. Although there are a number of elderberry varieties, it’s the black elderberry (Sambucus nigra) that’s believed to possess the most immune-boosting bona fides. It’s among the richest sources of plant compounds known as polyphenols, specifically anthocyanins, which have been shown to help immune function. Supplements aren’t without risks, side effects When people are considering any health intervention, they should take two things into account, says Mary L. Hardy, M.D., a botanical medicine and integrative medicine expert with the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine. “The first is safety, and a close second is efficacy. Is it safe, and does it work?” Apart from the big caveat with elderberry — when eaten raw, the berries can be poisonous and make you sick — “it has a good safety record,” says Hardy, citing a review of studies published in 2021 in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies. Although the researchers found that the evidence for effectiveness was mixed, they concluded that the herb appeared to be a safe option for soothing upper respiratory symptoms. It’s easy to assume that anything as ubiquitous as elderberry — supplements are sold online and on store shelves — isn’t capable of doing serious harm. But doctors and public health professionals caution that’s not true, especially for people with chronic conditions. “Elderberry may overstimulate the immune system, which can worsen autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or multiple sclerosis, and it can react with certain medications or cause upset stomach,” says Maria Portela, M.D., associate professor at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences and chief of Family Medicine. If you have a high fever or a preexisting condition like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes, in addition to those mentioned above, talk to your doctor before taking any supplement. Another consideration: “Elderberry may help relieve symptoms, but it shouldn’t replace antiviral medications such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or baloxavir (Xofluza) for high-risk populations such as people who are immunocompromised,” Portela says. “Unlike elderberry, these medications have undergone rigorous clinical trials and are FDA-approved for influenza treatment,"" she says. If you take any type of medicine or supplement, you should also check with your doctor before trying elderberry. “Elderberry and other botanical supplements can interact with other medications or supplements and might have other side effects,” Cohen says. “In the case of elderberry, it might have a diuretic effect or make people a little dehydrated. But that effect is unpredictable because you can’t really know how much of the active ingredient is in the supplement. Because of the lack of standardization, you’re in a bind.” Shopping for supplements: What to look for If your doctor gives you the green light and you want to add elderberry to your cold and flu cabinet, some clues on the label can help you choose wisely, Hardy says. For instance, in addition to the common name (elderberry), look for the botanical name (Sambucus nigra) on the label. “If I picked up an herbal product and it had the common name but not the scientific name, I would put that product back,” Hardy says. In addition, she says, “a good label will also tell you which part of the plant was used (that should be the berry); how the product was managed (for instance, as crushed dried berry or as an extract); as well as how much of a marker compound is in that extract.” In herbal supplements, the quantity of a marker compound is a tip-off to the quality of the product. Although there are no guarantees that herbal supplements will live up to their claims or be side-effect-free, the following seals of approval offer some assurance that what’s on the label matches what’s in the product: USP (United States Pharmacopeia), NSF (NSF International), or CL (ConsumerLab.com). All of these indicate the product has been tested, audited and certified by an independent organization, “though it’s important to remember that doing so doesn’t guarantee a product’s safety,” Portela says. Bottom line: “Elderberry supplements may offer mild benefits in reducing the duration and severity of colds or flu,” Portela says. “It should not, however, replace flu vaccines, antiviral medications, or supportive treatments such as hydration and rest.” Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Women’s Health, Prevention, Health and Reader's Digest.","The article explores whether elderberry supplements can effectively alleviate cold and flu symptoms.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/heart-disease/,"8 Things to Know About Heart Disease The country’s no. 1 killer is more common among older adults — but there are ways to lower your risk By Lauren Evoy Davis, AARP Comments En español Published March 20, 2025 Getty Images Despite medical advances, heart disease has remained the leading cause of death in the U.S. for more than a century, killing one person every 33 seconds. And for a number of reasons, older adults are more likely to be affected by it. According to national statistics, nearly a quarter of U.S. adults ages 75 and older have heart disease, an umbrella term for a cluster of heart conditions, including coronary artery disease and heart failure. Roughly 14 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 and 9 percent of adults ages 55 to 64 have received a diagnosis. 7 types of heart disease Coronary artery disease — narrowing of your heart’s blood vessels because of fatty deposits Arrhythmias — abnormal heart rhythms Heart valve diseases Cardiomyopathy — abnormal heart muscle Heart failure — heart squeezing and relaxation difficulties Congenital heart disease — heart issues you have at birth Issues with the fluid-filled sac surrounding your heart (pericardium) Source: Cleveland Clinic “Heart disease is unfortunately prevalent,” says Steven Tabak, M.D., medical director of quality and physician outreach at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. “But we can really impact it” if we address its risk factors, he adds. Indeed, even as it becomes more common with age, heart disease is not inevitable. Doctors and researchers say there are several things individuals can do to lower their risk, and while it’s ideal to adopt these changes when you’re young, it’s never too late to start. Here are eight things you need to know about heart disease, including its risks, symptoms and how doctors help to treat it. 1. Leading heart disease risk factors are common among older adults A handful of habits and health conditions can increase a person’s risk of getting heart disease. Chief among them is high cholesterol, which can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, causing them to narrow. High cholesterol — defined as total cholesterol above 200 mg/dL — is most commonly diagnosed in people between ages 40 and 59, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The only way to know your numbers is to have your cholesterol checked with a blood test. High blood pressure, which affects an estimated 63 percent of adults ages 60 and older, is another big risk factor for heart disease. A blood pressure reading of 130–139 for the top number (known as the systolic pressure) and 80–89 for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) is considered high. Other heart disease risk factors include: Diabetes, which affects nearly one in three people ages 65 and olderPhysical inactivityExcess weightAn unhealthy dietAlcohol useSmoking While many heart disease risk factors are modifiable, some are not. In fact, about 50 percent of heart disease risk is genetically determined, according to a 2024 article in the journal Atherosclerosis, which is why knowing your family’s history with the disease is critical. Genetic testing for variants of the TNNT2 gene can help your doctor assess your risk for developing dangerous heart conditions and inform the playbook for your individual health care plan. Abha Khandelwal, M.D., a cardiologist with Stanford Health Care in California, says people who are more susceptible to heart disease can improve their outcomes with heart-healthy behaviors like exercise and controlling blood sugar and blood pressure. 7 types of heart disease Coronary artery disease — narrowing of your heart’s blood vessels because of fatty deposits Arrhythmias — abnormal heart rhythms Heart valve diseases Cardiomyopathy — abnormal heart muscle Heart failure — heart squeezing and relaxation difficulties Congenital heart disease — heart issues you have at birth Issues with the fluid-filled sac surrounding your heart (pericardium) Source: Cleveland Clinic 2. Heart disease can lead to dangerous — and deadly — complications Heart disease can lead to several complications affecting not only the heart but other parts of the body. These include: Arr﻿hythmia — a fast or abnormal heart rateCardiac arrest — when the heart stops beating suddenlyCardiomyopathy — a disease of the heart that makes it harder for the muscle to pump bloodHeart attackHeart failureHeart valve diseasePulmonary hypertension, high blood pressure in your arteries which starves your blood of oxygenKidney damageLiver damage 3. Its symptoms can be sneaky Often called the “silent killer,” heart disease can strike without warning: You might not know you have it until you have a heart attack, stroke or other sudden event. Each year, there are approximately 605,000 heart attacks in the U.S., and 170,000 of them occur without any major symptoms. “We think of heart disease as this sudden, crushing chest pain with an elephant sitting on your chest. And that can be the case for some people, but for a lot of other people, it can be unusual,” says Samuel Kim, M.D., director of preventive cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. According to the Mayo Clinic, common symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels can include shortness of breath, weakness or numbness in the arms and legs, and pain in the neck, jaw, upper back or upper belly. Symptoms of heart disease caused by irregular heartbeats can range from dizziness to shortness of breath to a racing heartbeat. 4. Women have unique risks Khandelwal says heart disease is often assumed to be a man’s disease, but it’s also the leading cause of death among women. In fact, it affects more than 60 million women in the U.S., according to the CDC. Several health issues unique to women play a role in heart disease risk, Khandelwal says, including gestational diabetes, preterm labor, preeclampsia and the years leading up to menopause (called perimenopause) when estrogen levels drop. Estrogen has a protective effect on the heart by increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also called the “good” cholesterol. When women go through menopause, the drop in estrogen puts them at risk for heart disease when HDL levels start to creep up. 5. Some diets are better than others for heart disease Not all diets are created equal when it comes to keeping heart disease in check. The American Heart Association ranks a few at the top, including the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet — a low-sodium plan full of fresh fruits and vegetables and very limited processed foods — and the Mediterranean diet, also rich in plants, fresh fish, legumes, nuts and olive oil. These and a plant-based diet get high marks for lowering the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure, according to a 2023 article published in the Vascular Health and Risk Management journal. The article cited several studies, including one that found that people who ate a diet full of fruits, veggies and legumes reduced their risk of early death by 19 percent. On the flip side, doctors and researchers say there are several foods to avoid if you are trying to lower heart disease risk or manage the condition. These include: Fatty meatsProcessed foodsTropical oils and partially hydrogenated fatsFoods high in sodiumFoods high in added sugar “In place of fatty meats, try leaner cuts of meat such as loin and round cuts, poultry without the skin, fish and seafood, and beans,” says Kelli Metzer, a registered dietitian at GW Medical Faculty Associates in Washington, D.C. “Grilling, baking or air frying are healthier cooking methods than frying in oil﻿,” she adds. 6. Sleep habits can affect your heart Getting fewer than seven hours of sleep a night can increase your risk of developing diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure — all of which influence heart disease risk, the CDC says. Tabak says getting into a regular sleep routine is key to catching more ZZ’s. “People who don’t have a regular time to go to bed or wake up, they’re just setting themselves up for sleep deprivation,” he says. Sleep apnea, a common sleep disorder, can also increase heart disease risk or worsen it if you already have it. If your partner complains of constant snoring, that could be one clue that it’s time to check with your doctor about sleep apnea. Other symptoms include waking up feeling short of breath and excess daytime sleepiness. 7. A little exercise can make a big difference in heart disease risk The CDC recommends you get moving — and a little can go a long way. Aim for 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise, like walking — that’s a 21-minute walk each day. You should also incorporate strength training two times per week. The key, Tabak says, is to “find something that you enjoy doing and will do regularly.” Studies have found that even gardening can lower the risk of heart disease in older adults. 8. Medications can be lifesavers There are several medications doctors prescribe to lower the risk of heart disease or help manage it. Some of them include: Ace inhibitors, which lower blood pressureAspirin, to prevent blood clotsBeta blockers, to lower blood pressure and force the heart to beat with less forceBlood thinnersCalcium channel blockers, to lower blood pressure and relax blood vesselsCholesterol-lowering medicationsDiuretics, to help get rid of sodiumVasodilators, to lower blood pressure by widening blood vessels for better blood flow For several years now, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists — or GLP-1s, like Ozempic and Wegovy — have helped people with diabetes and obesity lose weight and lower blood glucose levels. More recently, some have been federally approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in individuals who are overweight or have obesity. “I think they [GLP-1s] have a role in reducing heart disease,” Khandelwal, says, though she cautions they may have some drawbacks, especially for older adults. “There is some evidence that when we lose weight with some of these medications, we also risk losing skeletal muscle,” she explains.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/medical-problems-mimic-dementia/,"Prepare to Care View Series 6 Medical Problems That Can Mimic Dementia — But Aren’t Medications, infections and sleep issues can cause you to feel foggy or confused By Michelle Crouch, Updated April 25, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published March 21, 2022 / Updated April 25, 2023 SelectStock/Getty Images ﻿If you’re an older adult experiencing memory lapses, lack of focus or confusion — or you have a loved one with those symptoms — it’s natural to worry about dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. A recent AARP survey found that nearly half of adults 40 and older think they will develop dementia — a share far greater than the condition’s actual prevalence. Other treatable conditions can cause similar symptoms, and they can be easy for doctors to miss, says Ardeshir Hashmi, M.D., a geriatrician and section chief of Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Geriatric Medicine. “Sometimes there’s just a very superficial workup, and then [the doctor says], ‘Here’s a pill for Alzheimer’s,’ ” Hashmi says. (Although there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, there are several federally approved medications that can help manage its symptoms. Two medications have made it to the market that could slow the progression of Alzheimer’s, though studies measuring their effectiveness are ongoing.) “Before you make that conclusion, you should rule out all the other things that can be confused with dementia — things that are easily reversible.” Here are some common medical problems that can be mistaken for dementia. 1. Medication interactions or side effects If someone complains of memory problems, Hashmi says his first question is always, “Did you recently start a new medication?” Older adults are more likely than younger people to develop cognitive impairment as a side effect of a medication, and drug toxicity is the culprit in as many as 12 percent of patients who present with suspected dementia, research shows. Dementia Caregiver's Guide The latest advice and resources to help you and your loved ones navigate a diagnosis. Real stories, resources, and advice Many types of prescriptions and over-the-counter drugs can affect your cognition, but the most common include those for sleep, urinary incontinence, pain, anxiety and allergies. Taking too many medications (called polypharmacy) can affect your ability to think clearly and remember things, Hashmi says. An April 2023 report from the National Poll on Healthy Aging found that 82 percent of adults ages 50 to 80 take at least one prescription medication; 28 percent take five or more medications. The same report found that 80 percent of older adults taking prescription medication said they would be willing to stop taking one or more if their doctor said it was possible.﻿ Even a prescription you’ve been on for many years can trigger confusion. The reason, Hashmi explains, is that your kidneys and liver become less effective at clearing drugs from your body as you get older, so a medication can build up in your system and cause problems. 2. A respiratory infection (including COVID-19) Any untreated infection, Hashmi says, can cause delirium — a sudden change in alertness, attention, memory and orientation that can mimic dementia. When you have an infection, the white blood cells in your body rush to the infection site, causing a chemical change in the brain that makes some older adults feel drowsy, unfocused or confused. Respiratory infections are harder to diagnose in people 65 and older because they are more likely to lack classic symptoms, such as a fever or a cough, Hashmi notes. In one study published in 2020 in JAMA Network Open, 37 percent of older COVID-19 patients who went to the emergency room with delirium had no typical COVID symptoms, such as fever or shortness of breath. Delirium tends to come on suddenly, whereas dementia usually progresses slowly, with subtle memory changes that gradually worsen over many years, Hashmi says. “Dementia is almost never sudden onset unless caused by a stroke. If you see a sudden change [in mental status], always think about delirium as a first cause. It is eminently treatable if you get to the trigger or underlying source of it, which is usually an infection.” Patients have reported difficulty concentrating, memory slips and attention deficits after they recover from a COVID-19 infection. In most patients, those symptoms subside after a few months. 3. A urinary tract infection Urinary tract infections are another common cause of delirium and dementia-like symptoms in older adults. In surveys, about 1 in 10 women older than 65 and up to 30 percent of women over 85 reported having a urinary tract infection in the past year. Men are also more likely to experience UTIs as they age. Like respiratory infections, UTIs manifest differently in those older than 65 than in younger patients, says James M. Ellison, M.D., a geriatric psychiatrist and the Swank Foundation endowed chair in Memory Care and Geriatrics for ChristianaCare, a health care system in Delaware and Maryland. In older adults, “some of the warning signals that help us make a correct diagnosis are altered or absent,” Ellison explains. “So, for example, an older adult with a UTI might experience a mental status change without a fever or burning with urination.” The good news is that most UTIs, and the accompanying cognitive issues, can be diagnosed with a simple urine test and treated with an antibiotic, Ellison says. 4. Sleep problems or disturbed sleep Getting a good night’s rest is essential for protecting the brain as you age, Ellison says. Sleep gives our brain time to learn, store memories and filter out toxic substances. If your sleep-wake cycle is disturbed or you have insomnia, you may experience dementia-like symptoms such as trouble focusing, confusion, mental fatigue and irritability. Studies have shown that insomnia affects 30 to 48 percent of older people. If you are struggling to get shut-eye, experts recommend limiting or eliminating daytime naps, restricting the use of alcohol and caffeine in the evening and following a consistent sleep schedule and other good sleep hygiene habits. If those remedies don’t work, cognitive behavioral therapy can help. Ellison cautions against the use of sleep medications except in the very short term and under a doctor’s guidance. Some older adults suffer from sleep apnea, a breathing problem that can deprive your brain of the oxygen it needs while you slumber, possibly causing long-term damage. Many patients don’t realize they have the condition, Ellison says. Inform your doctor if you have signs of apnea, such as loud snoring, waking up gasping or choking, uncontrolled high blood pressure, a morning headache or a dry mouth upon waking. If you are diagnosed with sleep apnea, using a continuous positive airway pressure machine (CPAP) while you snooze has been shown to be an effective treatment, Ellison says. 5. Dehydration Dehydration can look like dementia, and it’s common in older patients, Hashmi says. As you age, your body’s ability to retain water in blood vessels decreases, and your thirst mechanism isn’t as strong, so it’s easy to get dehydrated without realizing it. If you take diuretics or laxatives, they can further contribute to water loss. If someone you love seems foggy or confused, check to see if their urine is dark yellow or brown, which can indicate a lack of fluids. Another sign of severe dehydration is a white coating on the tongue, Hashmi says. Intravenous fluids can often reverse cognitive problems caused by severe dehydration. “It’s amazing what a liter of IV fluid can do,” Hashmi says. To prevent dehydration, older adults should aim to get at least 48 ounces of caffeine-free fluids (six 8-ounce glasses) a day. 6. Normal pressure hydrocephalus Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a treatable disorder in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, disrupting and damaging nearby brain tissue and causing cognitive problems. More than 700,000 Americans have normal pressure hydrocephalus, according to the Hydrocephalus Association, which estimates that less than 20 percent are properly diagnosed. Because symptoms include difficulty walking, forgetfulness and problems with thinking and reasoning, the disorder is often misdiagnosed as dementia, Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, Ellison says. ﻿ A neurologist can diagnose normal pressure hydrocephalus using brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid tests. It’s commonly treated by inserting a flexible tube, called a shunt, into the brain to drain the fluid. “We see a couple of cases every year,” Ellison says. “When we diagnose it, we’re always happy because it’s a condition you can treat. ... I’ve seen people improve dramatically.” Other disorders with dementia-like symptoms Many other conditions, in addition to the ones above, can cause symptoms that mimic dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, including disorders of the heart, lungs, liver or kidneys, thyroid problems, sodium or vitamin B12 deficiency, some cancers, pain, constipation, heavy alcohol use and depression. Many of those conditions are treatable, and cognitive symptoms can be reversed, as long as they are properly diagnosed, Ellison and Hashmi say. A routine metabolic blood test and a urinalysis, along with neuroimaging, will pick up many of those disorders. If tests come back normal, experts suggest asking for a referral to a geriatrician who specializes in older adults, who will do a comprehensive assessment before accepting a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. “It’s very important for clinicians and patients to recognize that dementia is not a normal expected part of aging,” Ellison says. About 11 percent of adults 65 and older have Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. “Everyone deserves a good workup to identify treatable and reversible conditions,” Ellison says. ﻿ Editor’s Note: This story, originally published March 21, 2022, has been updated to include new information. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Join Now Some people also only take medication when they “sense” that their blood pressure is high due to having symptoms such as a headache. This can be dangerous because most people have no symptoms when their blood pressure is elevated. That’s why it’s important to stay on your prescribed dosage and talk to your doctor about any concerns you have with the medications. A study published in the journal Hypertension reviewed high blood pressure treatment in adults age 60 and older in clinics across the United States from 2008 to 2018. Researchers found that only 30 percent of patients had reduced their blood pressure to the medically recommended levels during outpatient clinic visits. The authors did not have specific information on whether patients either stopped taking their medication or reduced their doses, but﻿ other studies suggest that one reason was concern for potential adverse side effects. Hypertension can lead to profound health risks, especially for older adults. That’s why it’s so important to understand what your blood pressure numbers should be, what the options for treatment are, how you can work with your doctor to help you improve your blood pressure and how to avoid the side effects of blood pressure medications. What is your blood pressure goal? Your blood pressure numbers are measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). According to the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guideline, normal blood pressure is less tha﻿n 120/80, elevated is considered 120-129/﻿less than 80, and hypertension is 130/80 or above. For older adults, the guideline states that a BP target﻿ greater than 130/80 mm Hg would be appropriate. While both numbers (top number — systolic, and bottom number — diastolic) are important, it is felt that in older patients, the systolic is much more important than the diastolic in determining a patient’s prognosis. Getty Images “While people over 80 years old are more likely to experience side effects [from medication], they also stand to gain the most from intensive blood pressure control through a proven reduction in strokes and heart attacks,” says Randall S. Stafford, M.D., a professor of medicine at Stanford University and an author of the 2017 guideline. He goes on to say that “﻿this requires carefully balancing potential benefits and harms, rather than simply forgoing intensive treatment.” Experts emphasize that care should be individualized. “As a general rule, the lower the blood pressure, the better, as this will reduce the risks of heart attack and strokes,” says﻿ James Shepp﻿ard,﻿ who researches hypertension in older people at the University of Oxford in England. “However, if an older person is prone to falling over, or experiencing dizzy spells, then it may be appropriate to reduce the amount of antihypertensive treatment they are taking and aim for a higher target, such as below 150 mm Hg.” Is lowering blood pressure in older persons safe and effective? A study published in the journal Circulation looked at older women and blood pressure ranges. “Our major finding was that in relatively healthy women ... aged 65 years or older, maintaining a systolic blood pressure below 130 mm Hg was associated with longevity,” or survival to age 90, says senior author Bernhard Haring, M.D.﻿ Frailty is an important consideration for older people, especially when falls could lead to mobility issues. A sub-study of the SPRINT Trial, a large study on hypertension, published in Circulation, analyzed 9,306 older patients and found that 26.7 percent of them had frailty. Patients with frailty benefited similarly to other patients from intensive blood pressure control without an increased risk of serious adverse events. ﻿ High Blood Pressure Treatments High blood pressure stages and types Hypertension causes and symptoms High blood pressure treatment, management and prevention Breathing exercises to lower blood pressure Blood pressure medication side effects Tart cherry juice and hypertension Getty Images What are the barriers to blood pressure treatment in older adults? As your body ages, how it metabolizes medications you take — called pharmacokinetics — also changes. This includes how medications are absorbed, processed and eliminated by your body. For instance, many drugs may stay in your system longer, increasing the risk of side effects. Older adults often have other health problems requiring medications. Polypharmacy — having to take many medicines — can result in more side effects. Also, many people may already have problems with balance, fatigue or feeling dizzy, all which can be worsened by side effects from medications. There can be many reasons for feeling lightheaded or having other symptoms, especially as you get older. It is important to speak with you doctor to make sure they are due to the blood pressure medications and no other causes. ﻿ Jennifer Cluett, M.D., a hypertension specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, says it is important for patients to “have open, honest, nonjudgmental conversations” with their doctor about their medications, including whether they are taking them regularly and what side effects they are experiencing. Do blood pressure medications make you feel tired? People taking blood pressure medications may experience feelings of tiredness, fatigue and drowsiness. The main culprits are beta blockers, alpha-adrenergic blockers and centrally acting alpha adrenergic receptor agonists, although others can have these effects as well. (See the dropdowns below for details on specific high blood pressure medications and side effects.) Why do these medications make you feel tired? It’s partly because of how these three classes of medications work. For example, beta blockers slow your heart rate. Alpha adrenergic medicines affect the central nervous system, including the sympathetic (“flight or fight”) system, which is involved in keeping us wakeful. The lowering of blood pressure itself can cause feelings of fatigue. It may just take getting used to your new normal, and often the feelings resolve after giving your body time to adjust. Shutterstock / Roger Asbury Can blood pressure medications cause lightheadedness? When someone goes from sitting to standing, blood pools in the lower body and does not immediately return to the heart to be pumped out again. Normally, the body makes quick adjustments (such as increasing the heart rate) to correct for this. However, age and use of some medications for lowering blood pressure can affect your body’s ability to make these adjustments and cause what is known as orthostatic hypotension, the main symptom of which is lightheadedness. Check for orthostatic hypotension: Take your blood pressure while sitting, then recheck after standing. If your blood pressure drops by more than 20 points systolic or more than 10 points diastolic within three minutes after you stand, this may indicate you have orthostasis and may need to talk with your doctor about changing your medications or doses. Other ways to reduce lightheadedness include: Get up slowly from lying or sitting. Try waist-high compression stockings﻿ or an abdominal binder﻿, which is a large compression belt that surrounds your abdomen and can help keep blood from pooling in your legs.Keep well hydrated,﻿ especially in hot, humid weather.Talk to your doctor about switching to blood pressure medications that are less likely to cause lightheadedness﻿. Shutterstock / Roger Asbury Cough due to ACEI Medications ACEI﻿s can cause what is generally a dry, tickly type of cough. The cough is a result of interactions between the ACEIs and substances your body makes. It can happen soon after starting the medication or even weeks and months later.The cough is generally not harmful and usually will go away after the medication is stopped.One option is to switch to an ARB medication, which is much less likely to cause a cough. Ankle swelling from Calcium Channel Blockers This is a relatively common side effect, less so﻿ with the medications diltiazem and verapamil. Lowering the dose may help.Adding an ACEI or ARB may as well. Using a diuretic (unless needed for another medical reason) will not help because of the physiology that causes this kind of swelling. Diuretics and urinary frequency A common and very bothersome side effect of diuretic medications is having to run to the bathroom to urinate, which can start to occur within an hour of taking the medicine. ﻿ If you take your diuretic once a day, take it in the morning to prevent having to get up during the night to go to the bathroom. If you have to go out, you may want to take it several hours before you leave, especially if you will not be near a bathroom.If you take two a day, try to take one early in the morning and the second no later than about 4 p.m.Shorter-acting diuretics (such as hydrochlorthiazide) tend to cause more urinary frequency than those that are longer acting (meaning the effect lasts longer in your body), such as chlorthalidone. Be careful about taking your medications in hot weather In hot, and especially humid weather, you may be at greater risk for having side effects from high blood pressure medications. Stay hydrated. Clues that you might be dehydrated are loss of body weight, making less urine and producing urine that’s darker than usual. Be sure to check with your doctor if you have been put on fluid restriction.Avoid alcohol, which can dehydrate you. Specific Blood Pressure Medications and Their Side Effects Many people can be started on one high blood pressure medication, or agent, but may require two or more if blood pressure remains high. It’s hard to say that one medication is better than another in terms of side effects, but individualizing your management plan based on what side effects you are susceptible to can help. The choice of medication may also depend on the need to treat other medical conditions, for example using a beta blocker for those with cardiovascular disease. Below is a list of commonly used blood pressure medications and their potential side effects. If you have concerns about any of the side effects, talk to your doctor about a potential alternative medication. It is important to not stop taking medication on your own, as this can cause your blood pressure to rise. The 2017 guideline lists the medications that are used for treating high blood pressure, divided into primary and secondary agents. For those in the primary group, there is more research showing that they reduce “clinical events,” meaning medical problems that may have resulted from hypertension. But that does not mean the other medications are not helpful, and your doctor may prescribe them for you. Open All Primary Blood Pressure Medications (Primary Agents) Diuretics﻿ (water pills) Examples: Thiazide diuretics: chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone, indapamideOther kinds of diuretics are considered secondary agents and include: furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene and amiloride.﻿ How they work: Diuretics work by helping your kidneys flush out water and salt from your body. Side effects: Having to urinate frequently.May cause your blood potassium and sodium levels to be low. (Exceptions are triamterene and amiloride.)May increase skin sensitivity to the sun.Infrequently cause headaches.Hair loss (less common except with spironolactone) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) Examples: Lisinopril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, ramipril. How they work: They inhibit your body from making a hormone called angiotensin II. Without this, your blood vessels can relax and dilate. Side effects: Dry cough (more common in women and those who are Asian) Can cause your blood potassium levels to be too high.Can worsen kidney function.Infrequently can cause headache.Rarely can cause angioedema, which is swelling that can happen anywhere in the body, including in your face, mouth, lips, throat and tongue, which can be a medical emergency. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) Examples: Valsartan, losartan, ﻿olmesartan,﻿ irbesartan, candesartan, telmisartan. How they work: They prevent angiotensin II, one of your body’s hormones, from constricting (narrowing) your blood vessels. Side effects: May push your potassium levels too high. Can worsen kidney function.Rarely cause cough and very rarely cause angioedema. ﻿ Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) Examples: Nifedipine, nicardipine, amlodipine, diltiazem and verapamil; they are generally not used to treat blood pressure﻿ unless you need this medication to treat another problem, such as atrial fibrillation (A-fib)﻿. How they work: They prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells in the walls of your arteries, which allows them to relax and dilate. Side effects: Ankle swelling, which is more common in women than men and is dose-related.Diltiazem and verapamil slow heart rate. Secondary High Blood Pressure Medications (Secondary Agents) Beta blockers These are generally used in patients who have another medical condition, such as cardiovascular disease. Examples: metoprolol, carvedilol, atenolol, bisoprolol, labetalol, nadolol How they work: They slow down your heart rate and reduce the force at which the heart pumps blood through your arteries. Side ﻿effects: Some people have fatigue, feelings of depression and decreased exercise tolerance.Patients with pulmonary and reactive airway disease (such as asthma) may not tolerate beta blockers. Direct renin inhibitor Example: Aliskiren. How they work: They block a pathway in which your body makes angiotensin II, which constricts your arteries and results in raising your blood pressure. Side ﻿effects: Risk of high potassium, especially in people with kidney disease, GI disturbances (diarrhea) and cough. Alpha-adrenergic blockers Examples: Doxazosin, terazosin, prazosin. How they work: They reduce nerve impulses that constrict your arteries. Side ﻿effects: Fainting, dizziness, drowsiness, vertigo, headache, orthostatic hypotension. Centrally acting alpha adrenergic agonists Examples: Clonidine, methyldopa, guanfacine. How they work: They affect nerve impulses from your brain, allowing blood vessels to dilate. Side effects: Sedation, dry mouth, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension. Direct vasodilators Examples: Hydralazine, minoxidil. How they work: They relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, allowing them to dilate. Side ﻿effects: May cause sodium and water retention.Can increase your heart﻿ rate.Minoxidil can cause hirsutism (hair growth, especially on the face in women).Hydralazine can cause headache and a lupus-like syndrome. Tips for Taking (and Staying On) Blood Pressure Medications At your doctor’s appointment: Review your overall health status and any other medical problems.Bring a list of all your medications, dosages and why you are taking each one. Include nonprescription medications as well as vitamins, supplements, minerals and herbal preparations. Also note any drug allergies. After starting a new medication: Unless you have a serious reaction, try to give the new medication some time, say several days to a week, to see how you adjust to taking it.It’s best not to stop any medication without first communicating with your doctor.If you are not tolerating a higher dose, ask to take a lower dose.

The website where people could previously place orders for up to four free tests per household says orders placed before 8:00 p.m. on March 9 will still be shipped. The website also says that rapid tests that detect COVID-19 are sold at pharmacies, grocery stores and many other retailers nationwide. Prices vary, but a pack of two at-home tests typically costs around $20. The test distribution program began in the winter of 2022 and has run intermittently since. As of October 2024, it had distributed approximately 900 million free tests to American households. Tests remain a key tool for older adults Doctors and public health experts have long stressed that testing is especially important for older adults who experience a fever, cough, sore throat or other symptoms that could signal COVID-19. Age and COVID Risk Age remains the strongest risk factor for severe COVID outcomes. Compared with people ages 18–29 years, the risk of death is: 25 times higher in those ages 50–64 60 times higher in those ages 65–74 140 times higher in those ages 75–84 years 340 times higher in those age 85-plus Source: CDC The main reason is “so that they can get an antiviral as soon as possible” if the test indicates the coronavirus is to blame, explains Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the Department of Epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. In clinical trials and real-world studies, antiviral treatments, like Paxlovid, have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in people at high risk for severe illness, a population that includes older adults. “Antivirals interfere with the virus and decrease the level of the virus in a person’s body, and thereby decrease complications, decrease symptoms, get you better faster, and in some cases, even prevent death,” infectious disease expert Amesh Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said in a recent news briefing. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says for these medications to be effective, they need to be started as soon as possible — within five to seven days of symptom onset. Age and COVID Risk Age remains the strongest risk factor for severe COVID outcomes. Compared with people ages 18–29 years, the risk of death is: 25 times higher in those ages 50–64 60 times higher in those ages 65–74 140 times higher in those ages 75–84 years 340 times higher in those age 85-plus Source: CDC “The home tests make it a lot easier to fit that window and get the drug as quickly as possible,” Adalja said. If the test is negative for COVID-19, a flu test might be needed. Similar to COVID, older adults are more likely to experience severe flu symptoms and may need a different antiviral medication to keep the illness from worsening. You can find combination COVID-19-influenza tests at pharmacies and retail stores. Testing for COVID if you’re not feeling well can also help prevent the spread of the illness since it’s recommended that individuals with an infection stay away from others until they’re feeling better and their symptoms, including fever, have subsided for at least 24 hours. Some insurance plans cover at-home COVID-19 test kits, but coverage varies. Medicare Part B covers laboratory COVID-19 tests that are ordered by a provider. Older adults make up the majority of COVID hospitalizations COVID-19 activity has been declining since its winter peak, but the illness is still sending people to the hospital, and the vast majority of them are older adults, CDC data shows. What’s more, older adults, along with young children, continue to account for the majority of COVID-related emergency department visits, the CDC says. In October 2024, the CDC recommended that adults 65 and older get a second dose of the latest COVID-19 vaccine this spring — about six months after their fall shot — to strengthen a waning defense against the virus. In the past, COVID-19 activity has spiked in the summer months, which we don’t typically see with other respiratory illnesses, like flu.

And plenty of people know that taking over-the-counter medication can lead to unwanted symptoms (think of how some antihistamines can make you sleepy). When it comes to dietary supplements, however, many consumers are unaware that their vial of vitamins or bottle of herbs and other botanicals (think echinacea and ginkgo biloba) could come with risks. And a big reason boils down to how they’re sold — “as openly and as freely as food,” says Pieter Cohen, M.D., an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplement safety. “So just like you can buy some broccoli or a can of tomato sauce, you can just buy whatever sort of supplements or botanicals or probiotics you want in the store,” he says. And this helps to create a ""false impression"" that the powders, pills and capsules can’t cause harm. But a 2015 study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that about 23,000 people wind up in the emergency room each year due to adverse events caused by dietary supplements. Reactions the researchers identified ranged from chest pain and heart palpitations to dizziness and vomiting, and adults 65 and older were more likely to be hospitalized because of them. Rashes, shortness of breath, diarrhea, severe joint or muscle pain, slurred speech and blood in the urine are other possible adverse events that can result from supplement use, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These symptoms can vary from less serious to life-threatening. Did You Know? Fresh fruits and veggies are packed with vitamins and minerals, but manufacturers also add them to everyday foods, like breakfast cereals and beverages.

Reasons run the gamut, experts say. Did You Know? Fresh fruits and veggies are packed with vitamins and minerals, but manufacturers also add them to everyday foods, like breakfast cereals and beverages. So you may be getting more nutrients than you think through your diet, and taking more than you need raises the risk of side effects. Source: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements Supplements, which are not held to the same federal approval standards as over-the-counter and prescription drugs, despite their widespread use, contain active ingredients that can have strong effects on the body, the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements explains. And in some products, these ingredients can be particularly potent. Cohen points to red yeast rice as an example — it’s a traditional Chinese culinary and medicinal product that’s “been used for hundreds of years to treat a variety of problems.” In the U.S., supplements containing red yeast rice are often marketed as effective at lowering cholesterol, and that’s because some red yeast rice products contain a substance produced by the yeast that is “chemically identical to the active ingredient in the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin,” the NIH’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health says. Some supplements contain no or low levels of this substance (known as monacolin K), but others are formulated “more like a prescription drug,” Cohen says. In turn, they can cause the same types of side effects and drug interactions as lovastatin, like muscle pain and weakness and liver toxicity, according to the NIH. And often consumers have no way of knowing how much of this prescription-like substance is present in a supplement. Supplements can also interact with other drugs in dangerous ways. Vitamin K can hamper the effectiveness of blood thinners, while vitamin E can augment their power, increasing the risk of bleeding. And Saint-John’s-wort can weaken the effects of some heart medications, antidepressants and statins. Older adults need to be especially careful when it comes to possible interactions such as these, Cohen warns, since “many people who are over 65 are taking prescription medications.” In fact, more than 4 in 10 adults 65 and older take at least five prescription drugs a day, and nearly 20 percent take 10 or more, according to a Lown Institute report. What’s more, older people don’t metabolize compounds found in drugs and supplements as efficiently as their younger peers. “So taking excessive supplements can certainly lead to more problems in someone [who has a harder time] getting it out of their system, because the kidneys are not functioning like they would in a 20- or 30-year-old,” he explains.

And supplements should be treated the same way.” His advice: If you’re interested in starting a supplement, step back and think about why you want to take it, and then bring that concern to your doctor. “We actually know that going out and taking a multivitamin just for general health — to prevent heart disease, cancer, you name it — doesn’t work,” he says. So ask your physician if you have a health issue that can be alleviated with a vitamin, mineral or other product. (You can also check out the FDA’s new Supplement Your Knowledge initiative for a list of other questions to bring up with a health care provider regarding supplement use.) If you are already taking a supplement — and more than half of Americans are — it’s important to let your doctor know, says Cara Welch, director of the FDA’s Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Keep a record of what you are taking and how often. Or, better yet, bring the bottles to your next appointment so your doctor can take a look “and adjust accordingly, based on what they know about the patient,” Welch says. If a supplement is recommended, look for one that has a stamp from NSF International or U.S. Pharmacopeia, Cohen suggests. These third-party groups test supplements and verify that they contain the ingredients listed on the label and that they aren’t tainted with harmful substances. And remember that a supplement “should not claim to treat, cure or prevent disease,” Welch says. If you see one that does, that’s a red flag. Finally, if you experience side effects or a bad reaction after taking a supplement, stop taking the product and report it to the FDA. “We have physicians that review every single one of those adverse-event reports to see if they indicate an issue with a particular product or a particular ingredient,” Welch says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/cataracts-eye-disorder/,"What to Know About Cataracts and Cataract Surgery Learn about the causes, symptoms and treatments for this common eye condition By Linda Marsa and Kimberly Goad, Updated December 18, 2024 AARP Medically reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published January 07, 2019 / Updated December 18, 2024 Animation: AARP; (Source: Getty Images) If you live long enough, you’ll probably get cataracts, an inevitable consequence of getting older. Beginning around age 40, the eye lens can begin to cloud, but you typically don’t notice a change until after 60. By 80, more than half of all Americans will either have cataracts or have had cataract surgery. “I liken cataracts to wrinkles and gray hair,” says Anupama Horne, M.D., an ophthalmologist and eye surgeon at Duke University in Durham, N.C. “In the end, nearly everyone will develop them.” But the good news is that today’s high-tech procedures restore clear vision in about 97 percent of the close to 4 million Americans who undergo cataract surgery every year. Sarah Peng/AARP What happens in the eye when you have a cataract? Imagine a broken lens on a camera. “No matter how much you try to focus the camera, if the lens is broken, you’ll get a blurry picture,” says John Bartlett, M.D., an ophthalmologist and eye surgeon at UCLA Stein Eye Institute in Los Angeles. Cataracts occur when proteins in the lens of the eye break down, causing the normally clear lens to become cloudy. Getty Images The lens in your eye works like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina then sends nerve signals to the brain, allowing you to see clearly both up close and far away. Over time, as we age, proteins in the lens to clump together, clouding the lens. This cloudiness, known as a cataract, gradually makes it harder to see as it grows larger and thicker. Cataracts usually develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Unlike infections, they don’t spread from one eye to the other. What causes cataracts? Aging is the most common cause of cataracts, but other culprits can contribute, including certain medications, chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and poor lifestyle habits, like smoking or exposure to too much ultraviolet light from the sun. Family history also plays a role. Because age-related cataracts generally develop over time, worsening vision may not be noticeable in the very early stages. But as the clear lens of the eye slowly turns a yellowish/brownish color, the increased tinting may make it more difficult to read and colors seem faded. Other symptoms include blurry or double vision, glare — when headlights, lamps or sunlight appear blindingly bright — and poor night vision that can make driving hazardous. “It’s like a piece of clear plastic becomes yellowed and discolored,” says Bartlett. “As new layers are added, it becomes denser and harder.” Three types of cataracts Like an onion, the lens is composed of multiple layers. The outermost is known as the capsule. The layer inside the capsule is called the cortex. And the innermost layer is the nucleus. The three types of cataracts are named for their location in the lens: Posterior capsular: Unlike the other two, this type of cataract, found in the back outer layer of the lens, tends to develop rapidly. Cortical: Located in the outer layer of the lens surrounding the nucleus. Picture a wedge or a spoke — that’s what a cortical cataract looks like to your eye doctor.

The nucleus tends to darken with age, changing from clear to yellow and sometimes brow Sarah Peng/AARP Getty Images Three types of cataracts Like an onion, the lens is composed of multiple layers. The outermost is known as the capsule. The layer inside the capsule is called the cortex. And the innermost layer is the nucleus. The three types of cataracts are named for their location in the lens: Posterior capsular: Unlike the other two, this type of cataract, found in the back outer layer of the lens, tends to develop rapidly. Cortical: Located in the outer layer of the lens surrounding the nucleus. Picture a wedge or a spoke — that’s what a cortical cataract looks like to your eye doctor. Nuclear: As the name suggests, this type of cataract is found in the innermost layer at the center of the lens. The nucleus tends to darken with age, changing from clear to yellow and sometimes brow How are cataracts diagnosed? If you’re keeping up with regular eye exams—for people 50 and older, that means a comprehensive exam every year or two, depending on your specific age, overall health and risk factors for eye disease—your doctor will be on the lookout for the symptoms above. Cataracts are usually identified with the help of a visual acuity test, where you read letters of varying sizes off an eye chart. This measures the sharpness and clarity of your vision, and how well you can see at various distances. You’ll also be given a dilated eye exam, in which drops are used to dilate and widen the pupils, offering your eye doctor a clearer view of the back of your eye. Your doctor will then use a specialized magnifying microscope known as a slit-lamp to examine your cornea, iris, and lens to look for signs of cataracts, as well as examine the retina and optic nerve for evidence of eye damage and other problems such as glaucoma. Other tests may include measuring the pressure within the eye as well as tests to check color vision and glare sensitivity. Treatment of cataracts When cataracts are in their early stages, you may be able to find relief with a new eyeglass prescription, brighter lighting, antiglare sunglasses or magnifying lenses. But once the cataract progresses and symptoms are interfering with your daily activities — reading, driving, watching TV — then surgery to remove the cataract is the only alternative. “Don’t get fooled by scams,” says Bartlett. “I see ads for eye drops, usually homeopathic, that purport to get rid of cataracts. The only treatment to remove cataracts is surgical.” Before you undergo the procedure, your surgeon may have you see your family doctor for a thorough medical exam to make sure you’re stable enough for surgery, says Ravi Goel, M.D., a New Jersey eye surgeon and clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Cataract surgery is considered low risk, even in patients who have certain heart and lung conditions. The procedure does not require major incisions or general anesthesia. What to expect from surgery Before: A week before surgery, your doctor will test your eyes to measure the curve of the cornea and the size and shape of your eye. The information will help determine which type of artificial lens — known as an intraocular lens (IOL) — is right for you. Your lifestyle will also play a role. For instance: When you think about how you like to spend your day, what vision needs are most important to you—reading, driving, or using a computer? The answer to that question will help guide the selection of an IOL, which includes: The monofocal IOL, the most common type of lens, provides clear vision at one distance (usually a far-off distance) meaning you’d require glasses for near or intermediate tasks.The toric IOL corrects astigmatism in addition to providing focusing power.The multifocal IOL—as the name suggests—provides clear vision at multiple distances, potentially reducing the need for glasses.The extended depth of focus IOL improves vision across a range of distances, often with fewer side effects than multifocal IOLs. A week before surgery, you may also need to temporarily stop taking certain medications. If you have cataracts in both eyes, each eye will be treated at a separate time to allow for healing. During: The surgery itself takes less than an hour and is generally an outpatient procedure, performed under local anesthesia to numb the nerves in and around the eye. The operation involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with a clear, artificial one (the IOL). Your surgeon will use tiny tools to cut into your eye, break up the lens, take it out, and place the new artificial lens in your eye. (See “Four types of cataract surgery,” below.) After: With most people, vision improves quickly, and colors appear more vivid. Normal activities can be resumed, although an eyepatch over the eye may need to be worn for several nights while sleeping. Itching and mild discomfort are normal, and eyes may feel sensitive to light and touch. However, these unpleasant aftereffects should diminish within a day or two. Eye drops will need to be administered to help with healing and decrease the risk of infection; an eye shield or eyeglasses may be worn to protect the eyes.

Jacopin / BSIP / Science Source (3) Four types of cataract surgery Phacoemulsification Cataract Surgery: As one of the most common types of cataract surgery, phacoemulsification involves creating a small incision approximately 2 to 3 millimeters across the eye. A probe is inserted and ultrasound is used to break up the damaged lens into tiny pieces. The lens is then suctioned out of the eye with a vacuum to make way for the IOL. Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Surgery (FLACS): This procedure combines advanced laser technology with phacoemulsification and is now a widely used technique. A device placed over the eye transmits detailed information to the femtosecond laser, enabling precise programming of the incision's location and depth. The laser creates the incision and softens the cataract, making it easier to remove during phacoemulsification. This method reduces the amount of energy required during the procedure, minimizes inflammation, and promotes faster recovery. Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS): This procedure involves removing the damaged lens through a small, tunnel-shaped incision in the eye. The self-sealing incision eliminates the need for sutures, lowering the risk of complications. However, it is rarely used in the United States. Extracapsular Surger: An older technique that is now seldom used, this procedure involves making an incision in the cornea with a scalpel to remove the lens. It is typically reserved for dense cataracts that cannot be treated with phacoemulsification. Complications As with any surgery, there is a possibility of complications, such as infection, bleeding, inflammation, double vision and high or low eye pressure. In rare instances, retinas can become detached. However, these problems are rare and can usually be treated with prompt medical attention. Occasionally, the eye tissue that encapsulates the IOL can cloud the new lens — a condition that is known as “posterior capsular opacification” or “secondary cataract,” which can develop months or even years after the surgery. It happens when a membrane called the posterior capsule—a sort of transparent pocket that holds your IOL in place—becomes cloudy. This normally can be corrected with a laser procedure. Can you prevent cataracts? While not everyone will develop cataracts, many do. That said, there are steps you can take to delay their onset, slow down the progression or even avoid the need for treatment. One of the most important: Protecting your eyes from the sun’s ultraviolet rays. “Long-term exposure to UV light does increase risks,” says Shahzad Mian, M.D., an eye surgeon at the Kellogg Eye Center at the University of Michigan. “People who live in equatorial climates get more advanced cataracts and at a younger age because of the more intense sunlight.” When you’re outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with UV400 or 100 percent UV protection to block harmful ultraviolet sunlight. Additional lifestyle changes include: If you smoke, stop; if you drink alcohol, do so in moderation; when sitting at the computer take screen breaks every 20 minutes; and focus on consuming a mostly plant-based diet, especially dark green veggies. A review of studies published in 2023 in the journal Nutrients shows that increased consumption of plant-based foods—vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts—as well as low-fat yogurt, coffee, and fish is particularly beneficial in reducing the prevalence of age-related cataracts. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. An example of phacoemulsification cataract surgery, a widely used procedure for treating cataracts.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/hand-sanitizer/,"7 Things to Know About Hand Sanitizer When to use it, how it works and why you shouldn't make it at home Getty Images By: Rachel Nania, AARP En español Published June 12, 2020 One of the best ways to prevent a coronavirus infection is to wash your hands with soap and water — and when soap and water aren't available, public health experts say alcohol-based hand sanitizer is the next best option. But just how effective are gels and sprays when it comes to getting rid of dangerous germs, such as the coronavirus? Here are seven things you should know about hand sanitizer. 1. Hand sanitizer kills germs but doesn't clean your hands Soap and water reign supreme when it comes to infection control, but believe it or not, soap and water do not kill germs; they remove them. The duo's effectiveness boils down to the mechanics of handwashing. The rubbing and scrubbing of soap between your palms and fingers creates friction that breaks down the structure of the bacteria and loosens the germs from your skin, explains Maryanne McGuckin, an infection prevention specialist and author of The Patient Survival Guide: 8 Simple Solutions to Prevent Hospital- and Healthcare-Associated Infections. When you rinse your hands under water, you wash those germs down the drain. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, on the other hand, do kill germs on the skin — most germs, anyway. Hand sanitizer is less effective at killing Cryptosporidium, norovirus and Clostridium difficile, all of which cause diarrhea, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says. Scientists suspect hand sanitizer does, however, kill the coronavirus. Hand sanitizers also don't work as well if your hands are visibly dirty or greasy, and they may not remove harmful chemicals such as pesticides and heavy metals like lead. 2. Sanitizer trumps soap and water in certain situations Is Your Hand Sanitizer Safe? Is Your Hand Sanitizer Safe? Because handwashing — when done properly — is better at getting rid of germs and grime, hand sanitizer, for the most part, should be used as a backup to soap and water. “The time to use hand sanitizer is when you can't get to a sink and some clean water and a clean towel,” says Elaine Larson, professor emerita of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and a scholar in residence at New York Academy of Medicine. That said, the CDC recommends using hand sanitizer as a first choice in certain situations, such as before and after visiting a friend or loved one in a hospital or nursing home. (That's why you'll often see dispensers posted directly outside patient rooms.) A squirt of hand sanitizer on your way in and out reduces the likelihood you'll introduce a dangerous bug or leave with one. It's also a good idea to use hand sanitizer regularly when interacting with people who have weakened immune systems, Larson says. 3. Not all hand sanitizers are equal To kill most disease-causing germs, the CDC recommends using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Anything less than that may not work as well “for many types of germs,” and could “merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright,” the CDC says. When searching the shelves, you may come across hand sanitizers that contain benzalkonium chloride instead of alcohol. These products, however, are not recommended by the CDC, since “available evidence indicates benzalkonium chloride has less reliable activity against certain bacteria and viruses” compared to alcohol-based sanitizers. 4. Sanitizing technique matters Hand sanitizer works best when used correctly. Apply the recommended amount to the palm of your hand (make sure it's enough to cover the entire surface of both hands) and distribute the sanitizer all over, paying special attention to the fingertips, “because that's where you touch most other things,” Larson says. Continue rubbing the hand sanitizer into your hands until your skin is completely dry — it should take about 20 seconds. This step is key, both Larson and McGuckin say. ""The alcohol works and it does kill the virus and most bacteria, but the problem that we have … is that people don't use it appropriately for the given period of time,” McGuckin adds. 5. Cleaning products are not a substitute for hand sanitizer Courtesy World Health Organization Disinfectant sprays and antibacterial cleaning wipes should not be used as stand-ins for hand sanitizer. These products are meant for “hard, nonporous surfaces,” not human skin, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says. Even so, some people are using them this way. A report released by the CDC in early June found that approximately one-third of adult respondents in a recent survey engaged in “nonrecommended high-risk practices” with cleaning supplies in an effort to prevent a coronavirus infection. These practices included using bleach on food products, applying household cleaning and disinfectant products to skin, and inhaling or ingesting cleaners and disinfectants — all of which are unsafe. 6. Hand sanitizer can be dangerous Hand sanitizer can be toxic when ingested, especially by children. It can irritate the lining of the throat and cause gastrointestinal issues. And “drinking only a small amount” can cause alcohol poisoning in kids, according to the FDA. If you or your child ingests hand sanitizer, call poison control or a medical professional immediately. Hand sanitizer is also flammable. Though the CDC says the incidence of fires due to alcohol-based hand sanitizer is “very low,” it advises hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities to store hand sanitizer in a safe manner away from sources of ignition. The U.S. Postal Service also has restrictions on shipping alcohol-based hand sanitizer through the mail due to flammability concerns. 7. Homemade hand sanitizer can be ineffective There's no shortage of recipes for homemade hand sanitizer on the internet during this pandemic era. But the FDA, which regulates hand sanitizers, says it's best to leave the production of germ-killing gels to the professionals. ""If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer,” the agency says. Also: Adding rubbing alcohol to a bottle of non-alcohol hand sanitizer will not make the sanitizer more powerful. The FDA says it “is unlikely to result in an effective product.” Courtesy World Health Organization","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

The article explores the effectiveness and proper use of hand sanitizer, particularly in the context of preventing coronavirus infection. Key findings include the importance of using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, applying it correctly, and avoiding its use on visibly dirty or greasy hands. A novel insight is that homemade hand sanitizer can be ineffective and even cause skin burns if made incorrectly, highlighting the need to rely on professionally produced products. The CDC recommends hand sanitizer as a backup to soap and water, but prioritizes its use in certain situations, such as in hospitals and nursing homes.",216
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/germs-at-the-gym/,"7 Ways to Avoid Germs at the Gym Working out this winter? How to lower your chances of catching a cold, flu or something worse By Beth Howard, AARP Comments En español Published January 02, 2025 Sarah Rogers (Getty images 2) The healthier you are, the better your body is at fending off respiratory infections — and regular exercise is a key part of the equation. But things get tricky in the fall and winter months when cold, flu and other viruses are likely to be circulating in your gym or fitness center. “You have to weigh the benefits of exercise against the risks of actually getting infected from the gym itself,” says Scott Roberts, M.D., assistant professor of infectious diseases at Yale School of Medicine and associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale New Haven Health. The good news is that fitness facilities aren’t the worst place for picking up nasty infections, Roberts says. “Certainly it’s less risky than being in a household or sharing a cubicle with somebody who has COVID, for example, where there's a more prolonged degree of continuous exposure and an infection can overwhelm your immune system,” he says. Regardless, it pays to take precautions. “You need multiple strategies to reduce your risk,” Roberts says. Here are seven tips for staying healthy while getting healthy during respiratory virus season. 1. Update your vaccines Vaccination is the most important way to protect yourself from unwelcome respiratory viruses, health experts say. “It’s the most effective tool for preventing or spreading infection,” Roberts says. Although vaccines can’t guarantee you won’t get sick, they lessen the severity of illness and help keep you out of the hospital. For your best defense, get an annual flu shot and the most current COVID vaccine. The pneumococcal vaccine, which protects against the bacteria that can cause pneumonia, is now recommended for adults 50 and older. And don’t forget about the newer RSV (short for respiratory syncytial virus) vaccine, which is recommended for people 75 and older, or those 60 to 74 with high-risk conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, or a weakened immune system. 2. Know your enemy Respiratory viruses are transmitted in different ways. “COVID spreads mostly through respiratory droplets and aerosols that form when somebody breathes hard or exercises,” Roberts says. Colds, flu and RSV are mostly contracted by touching contaminated surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches and gym equipment, for instance. To avoid COVID, scope out the most ventilated spots in the gym, or see if you can crack a window, Roberts suggests. And keep distance — aim for six feet — between yourself and others, when possible. That means avoiding crowded classes in closed-off rooms during the peak of the cold and flu season. “Be willing to change your workout plans once you arrive (use different equipment or participate in classes) based on number of people present when you get there,” says microbiologist Daniel Sanford, a researcher at Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Columbus, Ohio. If it’s packed, for example, play pickle ball instead of taking a yoga class. 3. Sanitize To steer clear of colds, flu and RSV, wipe surfaces where these viruses can settle with a disinfecting or bleach wipe. According to Canadian microbiologist Jason Tetro, influenza virus can survive for four hours. And don’t forget free weights, which are rarely cleaned and are among the germiest objects in the gym. How you clean exercise equipment and machines makes a difference, however. Wiping them and then drying the wet surface with a towel defeats the purpose, Tetro says. “There’s a contact or ‘dwell’ time, which is how long a disinfecting product has to remain wet to be effective,” he says. That could be from 30 seconds to several minutes (the product’s instruction label usually has this information). But “how many of us are willing to wait three to five minutes after someone has used a piece of equipment?” Tetro says. He suggests investing in weightlifting gloves, which cover the palm and the base of the fingers, leaving the fingertips free. “We use the meat of our hands when working out,” he explains. To keep the fingertips virus-free, wipe them frequently with hand sanitizer, Tetro says. That’s particularly important as people tend to touch their faces many times an hour, giving germs a foothold. 4. Time your workout When you work out can play a role in infection risk, Sanford says. “If you know your gym does a thorough wipe down or cleaning at night, then getting in early before the equipment sees a lot of use is ideal,” he says. “If not, avoid peak hours like at lunch or after work, if possible.” A 2018 study published in the journal Environmental Science & Pollution Research bears that out. Researchers found that infection risk was highest in the evening when the gym reached peak capacity and carbon dioxide levels were highest, an indication that lots of people were breathing — and potentially exhaling virus particles into the environment. 5. Consider wearing a face mask If you are particularly concerned about breathing in infectious agents — or if you are getting over an infection yourself — a mask can be a good idea. “Studies have shown wearing a mask is safe for most activities,” Sanford says. “However, if you have a chronic lung disease, discuss with your doctor before working out with a mask,” he adds. Don’t worry that you won’t get a good workout if you’re masked up. A 2021 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that when healthy people donned face masks during rigorous exercise, their exercise performance and blood and muscle oxygen levels weren’t affected. 6. Bring your own gear As far as risks go, there’s little that’s germier than a yoga mat. A recent study showed that they harbor even more bacteria than dumbbells and barbells, which suggests that they could be a good repository for viruses, too. “Bringing your own is recommended as these materials are more porous and harder to disinfect,” Sanford says. “Bringing your own towel is fine, too, but towels should only be used to wipe your sweat, not to wipe equipment.” 7. Take your workout outdoors Consider walking, running or riding a bicycle outside. “I am a huge believer in outdoor risk reduction for all these viruses,” Roberts says. “Exercising outdoors, even once or twice a week, lowers your cumulative infection risk, and it’s just plain refreshing.” Beth Howard is a North Carolina–based health and lifestyle writer. She has written for dozens of publications, including U.S. News & World Report, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Prevention, Better Homes & Gardens and Reader’s Digest.","The article explores ways to minimize the risk of contracting respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, while working out at the gym during the fall and winter months.

A novel insight is that exercising outdoors, even just once or twice a week, can significantly lower cumulative infection risk, according to Dr. Scott Roberts, an infectious disease expert.",217
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/flu-treatment/,"8 Doctor-Recommended Tips to Survive This Year’s Awful Flu Season Aging immune systems have a harder time fighting off influenza By Kimberly Goad, Updated February 14, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published October 03, 2022 / Updated February 14, 2025 Philip Dulian/Getty Images The U.S. is suffering through one of the worst flu seasons in years, which is unsettling news for older adults who are at much higher risk of becoming seriously ill from influenza than their younger counterparts. Outbreak tracking maps show that the vast majority of the country is experiencing high or very high levels of flu activity, and health experts say it’s not clear when infections will slow down. While flu activity typically peaks between December and February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it can stretch into April. Already, the CDC estimates that the current flu season has seen at least 24 million illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths from influenza, and the number of cases continues to climb. For plenty of people, a case of the flu is mostly mild. That is not true, however, as you age. The rate of flu hospitalizations among older adults towers over younger populations, the latest CDC data shows. “Even though people over 60 are less than 20 percent of the population, they account for over 80 percent of the serious complications of influenza,” says William Schaffner, M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. No matter your age, getting a flu shot can help keep you healthy — and while the ideal time is early fall, doctors say it’s not too late. More than half of the overall U.S. population has yet to receive this year’s flu shot, according to the CDC. Roughly 70 percent of older adults got the vaccine for the 2024-2025 season. Unfortunately, a flu shot isn’t foolproof. “So what you do when you get the flu turns out to be very important for this [over 60] age group,” Schaffner says. Emergency warning signs of flu complications If you experience any of the following, seek medical attention right away: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening chronic medical conditions Source: CDC Here are eight ways to hasten your recovery from the flu, and the warning signs of a severe infection you need to know. 1. Call your health care provider ASAP Not everyone who gets the flu needs to see their doctor, but people over 65 do. That’s because age itself — along with many other conditions that often come along in later years, such as diabetes and heart disease — puts you at risk for serious complications from the flu, namely pneumonia. “As we age, our immune system responds less vigorously than it does when we’re younger,” explains Stuart Ray, M.D., professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins Hospital. “Both antibodies and T cells play important roles in protecting against infection and severe disease from influenza. And those tend to decrease during late adulthood.” Your doctor will likely prescribe an antiviral medication that helps your body fight off the influenza virus. Research shows that taking an antiviral, like Tamiflu, at the first sign of the flu can reduce symptoms and shorten your bout of the flu by one day. Don’t postpone treatment With antivirals, time is of the essence. You should take them within 48 hours after symptoms kick in. “What we adults tend to do is say, ‘I’d rather not go to the doctor. Let’s see if I feel better tomorrow,’” Schaffner says. “When we get what we think is influenza, it’s important to contact our health care provider, because the sooner we get the treatment, the better the success of the treatment.” Emergency warning signs of flu complications If you experience any of the following, seek medical attention right away: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening chronic medical conditions Source: CDC Keep in mind: You don’t have to make an in-person appointment. Your doctor should be able to assess your symptoms virtually, and new, over-the-counter tests that check for influenza and COVID-19 make it easier to diagnose flu. Miss your 48-hour window? There’s still some benefit to taking an antiviral “beyond the 48 hours, but it diminishes day by day,” Schaffner says. 2. Stay home The flu is highly contagious, spreading through droplets in the air when you cough, sneeze or talk. And that’s true even before you feel fluish. According to the National Institute on Aging, people with the flu can spread it a day before and up to a week after feeling sick. Don’t leave home until your fever is gone The CDC recommends staying home until you’re fever-free — without the help of fever-reducing meds — for 24 hours. 3. Wash your hands Disease-causing germs are easily spread by dirty hands. You know the drill: Throughout the day, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with regular soap and water — antibacterial soaps have no added benefit, according to the CDC — for at least 20 seconds. Don’t expect alcohol-based hand sanitizer to get the job done Sure, in a pinch it’s better than nothing. But research shows that soap and water are far more effective than hand sanitizers in removing certain kinds of germs. That said, if you’re nowhere near a bar of soap and running water, reach for the hand sanitizer. Just make sure it contains at least 60 percent alcohol. 4. Drink plenty of fluids “It’s important to stay well-hydrated when you have a fever,” Ray says. “Hydration will also help alleviate general malaise.” To that end, keep a big glass of water on the nightstand — juice, broth, decaffeinated herbal tea all work, too. Don’t reach for that morning mug of coffee Same goes for any caffeinated beverage and also alcohol. All of these are dehydrating, which will slow your recovery. “Dehydration means you can’t get your secretions up,” Schaffner says. “It’s more difficult to mobilize [the secretions] out of your chest and cough them up, and that can predispose you to the development of pneumonia.” 5. Rinse and moisten your sinuses A neti pot is one way to clear out built-up mucus in your sinuses. (Make sure you read up on how to use them properly to avoid any potential health risks.) If you’re not comfortable using the little teapot-looking container, here’s another way to relieve congestion and keep your nasal passages moist. “A warm — not hot — shower will immerse you in warm moisture, and that will lubricate your mucous membranes, particularly if you can cup some warm water into your hands, snuffle that up into your nose, and then very gently blow your nose,” Schaffner suggests. Don’t use a humidifier If your humidifier is just-out-of-the-box brand new, that’s one thing. But if you’ve had yours for a while, it’s probably best to skip it, Schaffner says. “They’re usually not cleaned very well, so bacteria grows and suddenly you’re aerosolizing contaminated water.” 6. Consider over-the-counter pain relievers Acetaminophen and ibuprofen aren’t cures, but they can help reduce fever and alleviate aches and pains. Just “be sure to read the label carefully because these medications are not without risk — they can injure the liver, kidneys, intestines and cause other side effects — and these risks rise with age and complex health history,” Ray says. “Moreover, they don’t reduce the risk of hospitalization or death.” Don’t take decongestants Or at least not without consulting your health care provider. Here’s why: “Decongestants contain a combination of ingredients, some of which can increase your heart rate, even raise your blood pressure, and possibly interfere with sleep,” Schaffner says. 7. Stay physically active Forget what your mother said about staying in bed 24/7. “You have to listen to your body. But the more time you spend horizontal, the worse it is — physically and psychologically,” Schaffner says. Don’t overdo it That said, now is not the time to try for your personal best — for example, turning that daily power walk into a run or trying that hot yoga class you’ve been curious about. “Although gentle exercise, even just walking around, will make you feel better,” Schaffner says. 8. Pay attention to symptoms If your symptoms are getting progressively worse — you’ve got chest pain, your temperature is going up, you’re coughing up yellow phlegm — call your doctor, “particularly if you have any underlying illnesses and you’re worse today than you were yesterday,” Schaffner says. Don’t try to tough it out on your own You may be in the early stages of pneumonia, the most common complication of the flu. It can cause severe illness in people of every age, but older adults are among the most vulnerable. ﻿Research published in 2018 found that more than ﻿1 in 6 adults 65 and older who are hospitalized with pneumonia die from the infection.

Snoring happens when air pushes past soft tissues that line the airway in the mouth and throat, explains Melissa Lipford, M.D., a neurologist in the sleep medicine group at﻿ the Mayo Clinic. “As we sleep at night, these soft tissues relax, just like our body relaxes,” she says. And when you breathe in and out﻿, “they start to vibrate, and that vibratory sound is actually what snoring is.” Sounds innocent enough, right? It can be. “Sometimes snoring is just snoring,” Lipford says, and something as simple as changing your position — try sleeping on your side instead of your back, for example — can put a stop to it. “But one of the things we worry about the most is it can be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea. And basically that’s when those soft tissues relax so much that they actually obstruct the airway,” Lipford says. Is your snoring due to sleep apnea? Obstructive sleep apnea is a relatively common disorder, especially among older adults, that causes a person to stop breathing in their sleep — sometimes up to 30 times every hour. Because the brain is constantly waking the body up to take a breath, “the sleep of someone with obstructive sleep apnea is peppered with all of these wake-ups,” Lipford says. “These patients really aren't able to get into those deeper, more consolidated stages of sleep.” The consequences of a shattered sleep cycle are serious, says Marishka K. Brown, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research, which oversees the National Institutes of Health Sleep Research Plan. Poor sleep is linked to cardiovascular risk factors like high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. It’s also associated with obesity, diabetes and dementia. It’s no surprise then, that researchers at Johns Hopkins found that severe sleep apnea in middle or old age can increase risk of premature death by up to 46 percent. “Sleep is like air and water, you need it. And if you don't get enough of it, if it is not refreshing and restoring﻿ and if you are not sleeping on a regular schedule, it really has an impact on your health,” Brown says. There is no hard-and-fast way to tell if your snoring is due to sleep apnea — a health care provider typically performs a sleep study to make the diagnosis. But a few patterns can point to the disorder, which affects an estimated 26 percent of U.S. adults between the ages of 30 and 70, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Pauses in your breathing throughout the night is a big one — this is something your partner may notice, or you may find yourself waking up gasping for air. Excessive daytime sleepiness is another. Loud snoring often goes hand﻿ in﻿ hand with sleep apnea, “but it's also important to know that not everyone with obstructive sleep apnea has loud snoring,” Lipford says. Some may not snore at all. Women, for example, can have sleep apnea ﻿without snoring due to differences in their anatomy. “So the bottom line is: Whether you snore or not, if you're not rested by your sleep, if you don't wake up feeling refreshed, if you have trouble maintaining sleep — all of those things are a sign that something could be wrong,” and you should talk to your doctor, Lipford says. Treatments for sleep apnea range from lifestyle changes to surgery. The most common method to treat it, however, is with a device that delivers air pressure through a mask while you sleep, known as a CPAP (continuous positive air pressure) machine. ﻿Other underlying issues behind your snoring Snoring could point to a few other health issues, like a deviated septum (which can be corrected with surgery), allergies or chronic nasal congestion. If a stuffy nose is to blame, try using nasal strips before bed. These can be purchased without a prescription and help to open up the nasal passages “so that you get less tension as you breathe,” Lipford says. A ﻿nasal saline rinse or spray can also help relieve snoring due to allergies or congestion, she adds. ﻿Common Causes of Snoring​﻿ While not an exhaustive list, here are six causes of snoring﻿. ﻿Sleep apnea ﻿Deviated septum ﻿﻿Allergies/chronic nasal congestion ﻿Obesity ﻿Smoking ﻿Alcohol before bedtime ​Another culprit: obesity, since fat along the neck can “cause some external compression on the airway,” Lipford says. “It just narrows that airway tube and can cause more snoring because those tissues are closer together.” Losing weight can often help put an end to snoring caused by ﻿excess weight. One study found that men who lost about 7 pounds saw a significant reduction in their snoring; those who lost 17 or more pounds practically eliminated it. Snoring can also be a result of smoking — it causes inflammation in the tissues that line the airway — or drinking alcohol before bedtime, since alcohol increases relaxation of the muscles in the mouth and throat, closing the upper airway. What’s critical, experts say, is to talk to your doctor if your snoring is disturbing your sleep or the sleep of your partner, “because it really could be indicative of something underlying,” Brown says. And don’t forget: ﻿The loss of sleep could be harmful on its own. “I really want to reiterate that sleep is a biological necessity; it's a necessary requirement for overall health and well﻿-being … and is equally important as nutrition and physical activity when it comes to disease prevention,” says Brown, who adds that adults should be aiming for at least seven hours of good-quality z’s each night. “So if someone is snoring and they get up the next day and they do not feel refreshed and their daytime sleepiness is interfering with their quality of life, then they should really discuss that with their health care provider.” Editor's note: This story, first published Jan. 21, 2022, has been updated to include new information. ﻿Common Causes of Snoring​﻿ While not an exhaustive list, here are six causes of snoring﻿. ﻿Sleep apnea ﻿Deviated septum ﻿﻿Allergies/chronic nasal congestion ﻿Obesity ﻿Smoking ﻿Alcohol before bedtime","The article explores the potential health issues underlying snoring, a common problem affecting nearly half of US adults. Key findings suggest that while snoring can be benign, it may also be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea, a disorder that can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and premature death.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/difference-between-dementia-alzheimers/#comments_widget_id,"Prepare to Care View Series Dementia vs. Alzheimer’s: Which Is It? How to understand the difference — and why it matters By Kathleen Fifield, Updated May 09, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published June 15, 2020 / Updated May 09, 2023 Getty Images The terms “dementia” and “Alzheimer’s” have been around for more than a century, which means people have likely been mixing them up for that long, too. But knowing the difference is important. In the simplest terms, one is broader than the other. If the two were nesting dolls, Alzheimer’s would fit inside dementia, but not the other way around. While Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia (accounting for an estimated 60 to 80 percent of cases), there are several other types. The second most common form is vascular dementia, which is caused by decreased blood flow to the brain. Other types of dementia include Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia. In addition, certain medical conditions can cause serious memory problems that resemble dementia. A correct diagnosis means the right medicines, remedies and support. It could also impact clinical trial eligibility and participation. What it is Dementia In the simplest terms, dementia is a decline in mental function — thinking, remembering and reasoning — that is usually irreversible. It’s a syndrome, not a disease, notes neurologist Ron Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging in Rochester, Minnesota. The catchall phrase encompasses several disorders that cause chronic memory loss, personality changes or impaired reasoning, Alzheimer’s disease being just one of them, says Dan G. Blazer, M.D., a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at Duke University School of Medicine. To be called dementia, the disorder must be severe enough to interfere with your daily life, says psychiatrist Constantine George Lyketsos, M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer’s Treatment Center in Baltimore. What it’s not? Typical mild forgetfulness that sometimes accompanies aging — say, having trouble remembering the name of an acquaintance who comes up to you on the street. In fact, the earliest stage of dementia, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is considered “forgetfulness beyond what is expected from aging,” Petersen says. With MCI, a person is still functioning normally — paying her bills, driving well enough, doing his taxes — though performing some of those tasks may take longer than they used to. When someone starts to need regular assistance to do such daily activities, “that gets into the dementia range,” Petersen says. Alzheimer’s Alzheimer’s is a specific brain disease that progressively and irreversibly destroys memory and thinking skills. Age is the biggest risk factor for the disease. Eventually, Alzheimer’s disease takes away the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. To help determine whether patients have this particular brain disease, doctors talk to the patients and their close family members about any recent challenges or changes in behavior or memory. They also administer a mental status exam in an office setting, and possibly do a short neuro-psych evaluation. While a cure for Alzheimer’s remains elusive, researchers have made some progress when it comes to finding treatments that may be able to slow the progression of the disease. So far, two drugs have received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration. How it’s diagnosed Dementia A doctor must find that you have two cognitive or behavioral areas in decline to diagnose dementia. These areas are disorientation, disorganization, language impairment, mood change, personality change and memory loss. To make an evaluation, a doctor (often a specialist such as a psychiatrist, neurologist or geriatric medicine physician) typically takes a patient history and administers several mental-skill challenges. Thanks to growing medical consensus that irritability, depression and anxiety often flag dementia before memory issues do (and official changes to the diagnostic criteria to reflect this), doctors also ask more about changes in mood or personality, Lyketsos notes. To check for cognitive decline, a doctor will ask whether a patient is experiencing just forgetfulness or, potentially more indicative of dementia, also having trouble figuring out calculations such as a restaurant tip, Petersen says. A physical exam can be important for flagging something like specific types of dementia caused by vascular disease (strokes) or Parkinson’s disease. Next, a standard and fairly brief round of memory and thinking tests is given in the same office visit. In the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, for example, you try to memorize and then recall a list of 12 words — and a few similar words may be thrown in to challenge you. Another test — also used to evaluate driving skills — has you draw lines to connect a series of numbers and letters in a complicated sequence. Video: How I Discovered I Had Early-Onset Alzheimer's Alzheimer’s Doctors use several different methods to determine if an individual has Alzheimer’s disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. Physical and mental evaluations are often part of this process. Memory and problem-solving tests are also used. With Alzheimer’s in particular, the progression and timing of symptoms is important. To identify this degenerative brain disease, doctors are looking for “a gradual, insidious onset that is slowly getting worse,” Petersen says. Until fairly recently (before the early 2000s), a conclusive diagnosis was not possible until an autopsy was performed and the brain examined for the physical hallmarks of the disease — beta-amyloid and tau, proteins that look like plaques and tangles in the brain. Now, a patient can get a PET scan or cerebrospinal fluid sampling that can show, with high accuracy, whether such plaques or tangles are present. But a high percentage of patients never get such a test, doctors say. For one, these tests are invasive. They’re also expensive and typically are not covered by insurance, though this could change in the future as more Alzheimer’s treatments become available. Researchers are hopeful that faster, less-expensive tests will be available soon, like a blood test to diagnose the disease in the doctor’s office, or even to identify someone at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s. Editor’s Note: This story, last edited on June 15, 2020, has been updated to include new information pertaining to Alzheimer’s treatments.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/living-with-long-covid/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by Living with Long COVID: What it’s Like to be Diagnosed with the Debilitating Disease Even mild cases of COVID-19 are linked to potential long-term repercussions — some of them deadly serious By Nicole Pajer, AARP Comments En español Published September 03, 2024 Eleanor Shakespeare (SOURCE: Left to Right: Getty Images (3); Alamy; Getty Images; Nathan Posner/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images; Getty Images; Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images; Daniel Knighton/Getty Images; Phelan M. Ebenhack via AP; Getty Images; Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images; Shutterstock) Chrissy Bernal has caught COVID-19 three times, most recently in ­October 2023. “My symptoms were always pretty mild,” she says. But after her third round of the virus, she ­developed extreme allergies to foods she used to eat all the time: oats, dairy, gluten, sesame seeds and peanuts. “I literally have some level of anaphylaxis every single day,” she says. In May, Bernal, 46, a public relations professional in Houston, went into anaphylactic shock during a virtual meeting. “I had to inject myself with an Epi while everyone watched in horror on Zoom,” she says. Natalie Nichols, 53, has been struggling with debilitating asthma and severe food allergies since she first caught COVID more than three years ago. “Last fall, I spent ­two-and-a-half months confined to bed, ­motionless, because moving, including holding a cellphone, made me too short of breath,” she says. She’s also experienced brain fog, high blood pressure, hyper­glycemia, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. Nichols, the founder of a nonprofit in Nacogdoches, Texas, recently underwent surgery to repair joint damage caused by COVID-induced inflammation. Lorraine W., of Clarence Center, New York, was looking forward to an active retirement when she was diagnosed with COVID in March 2020. “I’ve never returned to my pre-COVID self,” says Lorraine, 65. She’s on medication to treat small blood vessel damage to her heart and continues to battle a lingering cough, fatigue and breathlessness, as well as kidney disease. Neurological changes have made her legs unsteady when she walks, requiring her to use balance poles. “None of these conditions were present before COVID,” Lorraine says. In June, the National Academies of ­Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a comprehensive definition of long COVID: “an infection-­associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” According to that definition, 18 million Americans have experienced long COVID; currently, more than 1 in 20 of us are living with its symptoms. Researchers have begun to link long-term COVID with another recent phenomenon: our shrinking life expectancy. The disease we’re forgetting COVID doesn’t seem that scary anymore. More than 98 percent of the U.S. population has some degree of immunity — from vaccination, prior infection or both — and Paxlovid and other medications are available to counteract acute symptoms. For many of us, contracting COVID is like having a bad ­upper respiratory infection. But “COVID isn’t gone,” says Ryan Hurt, M.D., director of the Long COVID Research and Clinical Program at the Mayo Clinic. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that COVID still kills at least 1,000 people every week around the globe — but “we only have data from about 40 countries,” says Maria Van Kerkhove, M.D., director of WHO’s Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention. Older adults and those with preexisting conditions remain among the most at-risk populations for severe, acute COVID. ­People 65 and older accounted for 63 percent of COVID-related hospitalizations and 88 percent of in-hospital deaths during the first seven months of 2023, according to CDC data. Although the dangers of acute COVID ­infection may have ebbed for many, the ­reality of long COVID is coming into view. Of those who contracted COVID-19 within the past four years, 10 to 20 percent have experienced long COVID. “With every new case of acute COVID [the initial phase of infection when diagnosed or symptoms first appear], there is risk for developing long COVID,” says Caitlin McAuley, D.O., a family physician at the Keck COVID Recovery Clinic in Los Angeles. She’s had patients who developed long COVID fully recover, get reinfected several times with no lingering effects, then develop another case that leads to a new bout of long COVID. She’s also seen patients who got COVID twice with no lingering effects, and the third time they ended up with prolonged symptoms. “We still have a number of individuals who had the first wave of COVID who are suffering from long COVID symptoms now, several of them many years out,” says Jerrold Kaplan, M.D., medical director of the COVID Rehabilitation and Recovery Program at Gaylord Specialty Healthcare in Connecticut. Having escaped long COVID previously doesn’t mean you won’t face it in the future. Indeed, some research has suggested that catching multiple COVID-19 strains puts you at increased risk. A study published in 2022 found that reinfection can increase the risk of complications in major organ systems, and these risks persist at least six months beyond the initial infection. We don’t yet know the true impact of catching COVID. “Many chronic disease processes, such as cardiovascular disease, dementia and cancer, take years to develop. And whether acute COVID-19 puts people at risk for some of these issues? Time will tell,” Hurt says. What doctors do know is that patients are flocking to their offices complaining of symptoms they never had before COVID. Is long COVID boosting our death rate? In July, COVID accounted for less than 1 ­percent of all deaths in the U.S. Life expectancy in the U.S. is 77.5 years, reflecting an uptick over the past two years but still lower than prepandemic levels. Many factors contribute to that statistic, but it’s clear that the long-term effects of COVID have played a role. For example, a study in the journal Nature Medicine found that those hospitalized with COVID had a 29 percent greater risk of death in the three years after their infection. “But what was also alarming is that in people who weren’t hospitalized, there was also an increased risk of a variety of medical issues,” says John Baratta, founder and codirector of the COVID Recovery Clinic at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Even patients who’d had mild bouts of COVID-19 had an increased risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological issues lingering for three years after the initial infection. Long COVID patients had a significantly increased risk of severe health issues affecting the brain, lungs and heart. We have long known that an acute case of COVID can compromise heart health: Compared with those who didn’t contract COVID, people who caught the virus were 81 percent more likely to die of a cardiovascular complication in the ensuing three weeks, according to a study of 160,000 patients published by the European Society of Cardiology. But the risk lingers long after the symptoms abate. Those who caught the virus were five times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease as long as 18 months after infection, the same study found. Heart disease deaths, which had been on a downward trend for decades, began to spike in 2020 and remained high through 2022, the last year for which data is available. Stroke, blood clots in the legs leading to clots in the lungs, abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and inflammation of the heart are among the challenges COVID poses, says Mohanakrishnan Sathyamoorthy, M.D., professor and chair of internal medicine at the Burnett School of Medicine in Fort Worth, Texas. In long COVID, this collection of cardiovascular disruptions can present as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), in which patients’ heart rates increase abnormally when they go from sitting or ­lying down to standing up. One theory to explain COVID’s long-term effect on the heart — and the body in general — centers on inflammation. “Every time you get infected with COVID, there is a possible increased risk of long COVID, and some cardiac disorders can occur — especially if you have a history of heart disease, including stroke, heart disease and heart attacks,” says Pragna Patel, M.D., senior adviser for long COVID at the CDC. All of these problems can be exacerbated by the virus entering coronary tissue and triggering inflammatory responses that can damage the heart. Researchers say COVID may also alter the gut microbiome, a primary controller of inflammation, thereby triggering the immune system to rev up the condition. “There is no single agreed-upon mechanism that’s causing the issues,” Baratta says. “An individual may have multiple factors going on in their body, and not everyone will have the same underlying mechanism causing their symptoms,” which increases the complexity of both research and treatment. One factor that seems to matter: vaccination status. “Several studies show that vaccination can decrease the risk of developing long COVID,” Patel says. Vaccination rates tend to increase with age, with people 75 and older being the most well vaccinated — hence the most well protected from long COVID, Patel theorizes. That may explain why long COVID most commonly affects people ages 35 to 64; the risk seems to drop for those 65-plus, according to CDC data. From long covid diagnosis to treatment No single test can determine whether a ­person has long COVID. Doctors typically diagnose long COVID by reviewing the ­patient’s health history and current symptoms and trying to rule out other causes. A positive COVID test is not required, as someone could have been infected without knowing it, then experience strange symptoms later, Patel says. Though there are many ongoing clinical trials on long COVID, there is no umbrella treatment. Primary care physicians address what they can, then call in specialists — such as a cardiologist to handle arrhythmia or a therapist to treat anxiety — for more targeted care. There are long COVID centers around the country where teams of professionals work to help patients through their unique symptoms. “Because the effects of COVID are so wide throughout the body and mind, there will not be a single treatment for all long COVID issues,” Baratta says. “This is ­going to be treated by many different types of providers and specialists, and it will be treated, often, symptom by symptom.” Long COVID is recognized as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act if it substantially limits one or more major life activities. About 200 symptoms fall ­under that umbrella, Patel says. Here are some of the conditions we’re learning can linger months and, in some cases, years beyond an acute COVID infection. If these or other health changes seem familiar, consult your primary care physician. 1. Extreme fatigue It’s common to experience fatigue when your body is busy fighting off an illness. But some people still struggle with fatigue long after their initial COVID infection. In fact, a lack of energy is the number one symptom reported by long COVID patients. In some, this can be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome, which has been on the rise since the start of the pandemic, Baratta says. He defines this as “a disabling level of fatigue that severely limits daily activities.” This lingering fatigue may be due to limited production of energy within the muscles caused by damage to the mitochondria from a COVID infection. It can happen to anyone — no matter their level of fitness before infection. “I’ve treated patients who have been triathletes and now may only be able to do 15 or 20 minutes of exercise a day, when they’re used to running and swimming miles at a time,” Kaplan says. He recommends starting slow and pacing yourself with everything you do around the house, “doing shorter intervals several times throughout the day, rather than trying to do everything at once.” Whether it gets better depends on the individual. Some people’s symptoms clear, and some people may battle them indefinitely. 2. Shortness of breath An analysis of chest CT scans from 144 patients ages 27 to 80 found that more than one-third of people hospitalized with a previous COVID infection had lung scarring and thickening two years after coming into contact with the virus. Even patients with milder cases who walked away without scarring can experience changes in their breathing. “Some research shows that people ­after COVID start to take shorter, shallower breaths,” Baratta says. “This essentially causes a type of hyperventilation they are doing without even recognizing it, not getting good fresh air deep into the lungs, and [this] can lead to shortness of breath.” ​ Doctors have found success using respiratory exercises to help patients relearn slow, deep breathing. 3. Cognitive changes Difficulty concentrating, spaciness and forgetfulness are just a few of the brain challenges COVID can bring on. These can last for weeks or months or — in some with long COVID — become an everyday occurrence that lasts indefinitely. COVID may linger in a person’s gut long after an infection, altering their microbiome and hindering the body’s ability to produce serotonin, leading to cognitive disturbances. COVID may also disrupt the blood-brain barrier, allowing chemicals or molecules in the rest of the body to enter the brain blood circulation and potentially lead to brain fog, Baratta says. One study found that 30 days after testing positive for COVID-19, people were at greater risk for cognitive decline, as well as for mental health disorders including anxiety, depression and stress. Another study found inflammation in the brains of people with mild to moderate COVID-19 was similar to the effects of seven years of aging. Doctors are leading neurologically affected patients through cognitive rehabilitation exercises that show promise in reducing symptoms. 4. Depression and anxiety “Mood-related disorders are one of the top five issues that happen to people after COVID,” Baratta says. There may be a direct relationship between the virus’s effect on the brain and mood issues. A 2021 review of eight studies found that 12 weeks after a COVID infection, 11 to 28 ­percent of people had depression symptoms, and 3 to 12 percent of those individuals reported their symptoms as severe. If you’re feeling more stressed or down after catching COVID, tell your primary care physician, who can refer you to a therapist. Or visit the American Psychological Association’s search tool at locator.apa.org to find a qualified therapist in your area. 5. Sleep disturbances Nearly 40 percent of people with long COVID have reported major changes to their sleep patterns. One study looked at 1,056 COVID-19 patients who did not have a severe enough infection to require hospitalization. Of that population, 76.1 percent reported having insomnia and 22.8 percent severe insomnia. Sleep ­apnea may also appear post-COVID, another way the disease affects the respiratory system. Talk to your doctor if you’re having sleep issues. A CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine can help with sleep ­apnea. Lifestyle habits that prioritize healthy sleep, such as keeping consistent sleep and wake times and avoiding large meals before bed, may also help. “Post-COVID sleep has literally been a nightmare! We saw a 23 percent increase in sleeping-pill prescription during and post-COVID,” says Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist and clinical sleep specialist in Los Angeles. 6. Digestive upset Diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating and gas: These symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome can be by-products of an encounter with COVID. A survey of 729 COVID survivors found that 29 percent experienced at least one new chronic GI symptom six months after their infection. “There is evidence that parts of the COVID virus linger in the GI tract for many months after the initial illness, and it’s been suggested that the presence of these ongoing viral fragments causes dysfunction or problems with the GI tract, leading to mostly symptoms of diarrhea and gastric distress and discomfort,” Baratta says. Talk to your doctor about any new digestive symptoms or seek help from a gastro­enterologist. You can keep a food journal and note if your condition flares after eating certain foods. Try cutting out those foods, then reintroducing them one by one to see what you react to, Kaplan advises. 7. New or worsened allergies Some people who develop COVID experience allergies they never had before. One study found the risk of ­developing allergic diseases, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, rose significantly within the first 30 days after a COVID diagnosis. This may be because one’s immune system stays hypervigilant after fighting the virus, McAuley says. In severe cases, like Chrissy Bernal’s, this can lead to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a disease that can behave like a series of severe allergies: The body’s cells become hypersensitive, causing strong ­reactions to everything from food and pollen to even a hot shower or exercise. Antihistamines and other medications may help, so talk to your doctor if you experience skin itching, a rapid pulse, wheezing or gastro­intestinal symptoms. 8. Pain Some COVID survivors battle chronic pain, everything from aching joints to testicular pain. There is a higher risk of inflammatory arthritis, and women are at higher risk than men. One review of studies estimated that 10 percent of people who contracted COVID experienced musculo­skeletal pain at some point during the first year after infection. Reducing stress, eating a healthy diet and exercising may ease some post-COVID ­discomfort. Massage therapy, movement therapy, acupuncture and over-the-counter pain medications may also offer relief. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist, such as a rheumatologist, who can help manage symptoms including joint pain. Fast-moving research means new hope If your symptoms last after a bout of COVID, start with your primary care physician, who can help treat your symptoms or refer you to a specialist. Despite previous dismissals, long COVID is more recognized these days, Patel says, and the CDC is doing its part to educate both patients and providers. And initiatives such as the National Institutes of Health’s Recover program are researching treatment options. “In a year, things will look different, because research is moving so quickly,” says Sara F. Martin, M.D., medical director of the Adult Post-Acute COVID Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The CDC, for instance, is funding a series of clinical trials that the NIH has in the works. This new information, Martin says, may guide doctors, including herself, who treat long COVID ­patients to better ease their symptoms. Nicole Pajer writes about health for The New York Times, Woman’s Day and other publications.","The article explores the long-term effects of COVID-19, known as long COVID, and its impact on individuals, particularly older adults.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/superfoods-for-increased-energy/,"Superfoods That Boost Energy From purple sweet potatoes to beets, five energizing foods to add to your grocery list By Amy Synnott, AARP Comments En español Published March 17, 2022 Ira T. Nicolai / Getty Images If you’ve ever eaten a giant bowl of cacio e pepe for lunch only to find yourself struggling to stay awake three hours later, you are not alone. “Refined carbs, like pasta and bread, cause an immediate spike in blood sugar, which leads to a rapid rise in insulin, and then a swift plunge in blood sugar. This blood sugar roller coaster causes fatigue and drowsiness,” says Jeffrey Morrison, M.D., a New York City-based physician and certified nutritionist. The standard American diet of meat, cheese and highly refined, processed foods also destroys our gut and triggers inflammation throughout the body, sapping energy and health, according to longevity expert Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones Challenge. So, what do experts say you should eat when you need a quick boost of energy? In general, fiber-rich complex carbs (think whole grains and brightly colored, antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies) are your best bet, because they can easily be converted to glucose for energy but they don’t cause insulin levels to surge, says Morrison. If you’re looking for a more slow-and-steady kind of energy, consider adding some lean protein to that plate of healthy whole-food carbs. This will keep your blood sugar more stable (and bolster your self-discipline when confronted with a cupcake at 4 p.m.). Of course, when it comes to energy, not all proteins are created equal. Buettner, who has exhaustively studied the eating behavior of the longest-living people around the world, emphasizes the importance of a mostly plant-based diet. His advice: Treat animal meat like a condiment. In Blue Zones — five places in the world where people don’t just live longer but are often active and relatively energetic well into their 90s — they eat very small portions of meat and fish, he says. If you are looking to increase your protein intake, he suggests grilling up some tofu: “Sauté it with some teriyaki sauce, and it tastes just like chicken.” Read on for five more energy-boosting superfoods. Susanne Alfredsson / EyeEm Superfood No. 1: Purple Sweet Potatoes The Japanese island of Okinawa has the highest concentration of centenarians in the world, and until 1970, two-thirds of their daily calories came from purple sweet potatoes, says Buettner. In addition to being high in fiber, these slow-burning complex carbs are loaded with energy-boosting phytonutrients. Their purple color comes from anthocyanins, the same free-radical-scavenging antioxidants that give blueberries their potent anti-inflammatory effect. Susanne Alfredsson / EyeEm ATU IMAGES Superfood No. 2: Green Tea Though green tea doesn’t contain very much caffeine (approximately 28 mg in an 8-ounce cup compared to 96 mg in coffee, according to the Mayo Clinic), it may give you a more even energy boost thanks to the presence of L-theanine, an amino acid that can reduce stress and improve cognitive functioning, according to a 2019 study published in Nutrients. “I can’t say enough about the health benefits of green tea, specifically the antioxidant EGCG, which is anti-cancer and helps protect memory,” says Morrison. Keep in mind: Adding green tea to your diet doesn’t mean you need to totally ditch coffee. Coffee is one of the biggest sources of antioxidants in the American diet. For a drink that often gets a bad health rap, the energizing, free-radical-scavenging brew boasts a shocking number of potential health benefits. A review of recent research published in Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition showed coffee may reduce your risk of chronic diseases, including ﻿type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and liver disease, among others. JANINE LAMONTAGNE / GETTY IMAGES Superfood No. 3: Beans and legumes Like tofu, beans provide both fiber and protein, which help keep blood sugar stable so you don’t crash. “A cup of beans provides as much protein as a Quarter Pounder with none of the bad things,” says Buettner. (Fun fact: Eating a cup of beans per day has been shown to add four years to your life expectancy,"" he adds). He recommends combining a whole grain like brown rice with beans so you get a complete protein. “Beans are like Mardi Gras in New Orleans for your microbiome,” he says. “Bacteria in your gut thrive on plant-based food. They don’t consume any protein; they only eat fiber.” The typical American diet causes these bacteria to starve, so they start eating the mucosal lining of the stomach. When the lining becomes more permeable, it creates an inflammatory (read: energy-cheating) condition known as leaky gut, wherein toxic fecal matter literally leaks into your bloodstream. ATU IMAGES JANINE LAMONTAGNE / GETTY IMAGES “Eating high-fiber foods like beans is like throwing a bucket of water onto that inflammation fire,” says Buettner. Try adding a half cup of lentils to your salad. High in iron, potassium, zinc and folate, these legumes are also a good source of selenium, a mineral that may be a natural mood enhancer. A study in the Journal of Biological Psychiatry linked low selenium levels to poorer moods. Low levels were also shown to increase brain fog and decrease energy, according to a study in the journal Movement Disorders. Superfood No. 4: Beets Beets are a great root vegetable for people to start eating, says Morrison. This may be especially true if eaten after parties or celebrations, as they’re “great for detoxing the liver,” an organ whose poor functioning often manifests in fatigue. Beets contain nitrates, which convert to nitric oxide, a molecule that “helps with cellular energy and circulation, says Morrison, noting that professional athletes will often drink beet juice before a run. “Studies have shown that people who drink beet juice before running have better sprinting times than people who don’t.” GETTY IMAGES Superfood No. 5: Steel-Cut Oatmeal Gluten-free and high in fiber, this nutrient-dense whole grain also contains more fat and protein per gram than other grains, giving it a relatively low glycemic index. Translation: consistent energy with no wonky dips in blood sugar. Avoid quick-cooking flavored oats, which are highly processed and often filled with sugar. Though steel-cut oats take a bit longer to prepare, their nutty texture — and slow-digesting fiber — is well worth the wait. Another selling point: One cup of cooked oatmeal contains 61 mg of magnesium, a key mineral for energy production, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. A cofactor in more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including breaking glucose down into energy, magnesium also helps promote deep, restorative sleep. And all the purple sweet potatoes in the world won’t put a spring in your step if you’re not getting a solid night’s shut-eye. As the English Elizabethan writer Thomas Dekker famously said, “Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.” GETTY IMAGES Amy Synnott is an award-winning writer and former Executive Editor of Elle and Harper's Bazaar.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/spring-asparagus-recipe/,"Spring Asparagus Is a Delicacy Worth the Wait Chef David Tanis shares his recipe for a spicy stir-fry PHOTOGRAPHS BY PENNY DE LOS SANTOS By: David Tanis Published April 17, 2019 Fresh green asparagus is a luxurious harbinger of spring, most welcome after months of cabbage, squash and potatoes. By April, in most parts of the country, spring has arrived at last. These days, though, asparagus is available in supermarkets year-round, shipped from Peru or Mexico. Does that matter? If you are a seasonal cook, it does. And I am a seasonal cook. Cooking seasonally means waiting until a particular food is ripe in your region. It's about the joy of anticipation. There's a palpable thrill when spring produce finally comes to market, especially when it's asparagus. But then, I have been called fanatical as far as asparagus is concerned. When I was growing up in the Midwest, asparagus was never on the menu at our house. The only fresh vegetables I can recall were the ones we had in summer: green beans, tomatoes, corn and the odd cucumber or radish. The rest of the year, we had handy frozen vegetables that went straight from freezer to saucepan. After I left home, one of my first cooking mentors introduced me to the wild asparagus that popped up in the moist soil near an irrigation ditch on a remote California ranch. It was a small patch, but each day we could harvest a dozen spears, which we boiled quickly in salted water, doused with butter and ate with our fingers. It was insanely good. Such sweetness That's what I aim for when buying local asparagus. Look for smooth, shiny spears with tightly closed tips. Cook them briefly to keep them bright green, and serve them with your choice of sauce. Melted butter, vinaigrette, homemade mayonnaise or extra-virgin olive oil and lemon are good options. Still, asparagus season lasts several weeks, and sometimes plain but perfect doesn't fit the bill. Then it's time to consider roasting or grilling, or spaghetti with asparagus, prosciutto and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Assertive seasoning complements asparagus, too. This recipe I designed veers Chinese, for a quick stir-fry laden with chilies, ginger, garlic and sesame. Far from overwhelming the asparagus, the spicy contrasting flavors pleasantly accentuate the vegetable's sweetness. In the wok, as in life, opposites often attract. Recipe Spicy Asparagus Stir-Fry Serves 4 Ingredients 1 1/2 pounds pencil-thin or medium asparagus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon grated or minced garlic 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 1 serrano or jalapeño chili, finely chopped (seeds removed if less heat desired) 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 3 scallions, slivered 1 (or 2) red Fresno chilies, thinly sliced into rings 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds Handful of cilantro sprigs Steps Snap off tough bottom ends of asparagus and discard. Cut spears into 2-inch pieces (halve thicker pieces lengthwise). Set wok or wide skillet over medium-high heat and add vegetable oil. When oil is hot, add asparagus and toss well to coat. Season well with salt and pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute or so, then add garlic, ginger and serrano chili. Continue stir-frying for another minute, until asparagus is cooked but still firm and bright green. Transfer cooked asparagus to platter. Next, drizzle with sesame oil.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eye-diseases-fall-risk/,"3 Common Eye Diseases That Raise Risk of Falls Study finds odds of falling are 33 percent higher with these vision loss problems By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published January 12, 2024 Getty Images Are people with cataracts, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or glaucoma at greater risk of falls and fractures? That’s the question a group of researchers set out to answer in a large study, published in JAMA Ophthalmology, involving more than 3 million older adults. Granted, no one needs a study to appreciate that vision loss — no matter the cause — can play a huge role in raising the risk of falls and the injuries that happen as a result. Previous, smaller studies have implicated all three age-related vision thieves to varying degrees. But a question mark has hovered over how large a role each one plays.​​ Cataracts, the most common cause of vision problems, make the normally clear lens of the eye cloudy. AMD is a progressive disease that damages the macula, a part of the retina that helps you see what’s right in front of you. And glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness in people over 60, is a group of conditions that damage an essential nerve in your eye. Of the three, which is the biggest culprit when it comes to falls among older adults? ​​ Over a 13-year period, researchers examined the medical records of a group of patients who were, on average, around 74 years of age by the end of the study and found that the three diseases were almost equally culpable. The odds of falling were, on average, 33 percent higher among the vision impaired, as compared to those who didn’t have one of these eye diseases. What’s more, there was an increased risk of injury in virtually all areas of the body, including hips, spine, skull, ribs and lower legs. Common sense goes a long way in explaining why. “People with vision loss may have difficulty detecting hazards in their path, such as steps, curbs or uneven surfaces,” says Ashley Brissette, M.D., assistant professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine. “This difficulty in recognizing environmental cues increases the likelihood of stumbling or tripping.” But there’s more at play. The study suggests that even relatively mild vision loss can affect balance, posture and gait, each of which is critical to avoiding falls. “Vision is important for maintaining balance and spatial awareness, so when there is a loss of vision, it can significantly increase the risk of falls due to misjudging depth,” Brissette says. “Vision is also one of the key sensory inputs that contribute to balance.” When it’s impaired, the instability makes it difficult to maintain “an upright position.” “Vision loss can affect gait by limiting the ability to detect and respond to obstacles or changes in terrain,” she adds. “Additionally, fear of falling may lead to alterations in gait, creating a self-fulfilling cycle of increased fall risk.” Other factors leading to falls Complicating matters: Older adults are already at an increased risk of falls. According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 people age 65 and older reported falling in 2020; worse yet, accidental falls are the leading cause of injury and injury-related deaths in that age group. Vision loss isn’t the only culprit. “Several diseases can accompany the aging process that worsen the interaction between vision loss and injury,” says Michelle Andreoli, M.D., comprehensive ophthalmologist at Northwestern Medicine and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. “Diabetes, high blood pressure and other diseases that are more common with age can make injury worse, as well as worsen vision.” ​​ What’s more, some medications commonly taken by older adults — including certain drugs that treat heart disease, diabetes, anxiety and depression — can increase the risk of falls, as the JAMA study noted. The loss of muscle mass that comes with age also figures in, affecting agility. And then there’s the practical consequence of having bladder control issues that cause you to rush to the bathroom, tripping over, say, an electrical cord or slipping on a throw rug. ​ All of the above are risk factors on their own, but they contribute to the increased risk of falls in people with vision loss. The vision-impaired participants in the JAMA study all had poorer health and a higher level of multiple health conditions at the outset, as compared to their visually unimpaired counterparts. “The interaction between various health conditions can have a compounding effect on a person’s overall stability and mobility,” Brissette says. How to stay safe The good news: You don’t have to accept falls as a natural part of aging. For one thing, cataracts, AMD and glaucoma are all preventable or treatable. Early detection, though, is key. As the study notes, people in the initial stages of eye disease often have zero noticeable symptoms, and progression can be gradual. Both cataracts and AMD, for instance, usually affect just one eye at first. With glaucoma, peripheral vision is affected, but the brain compensates by filling in what’s missing. “If vision declines slowly, sometimes people have a hard time noticing their decline,” Brissette says. But that doesn’t mean early-stage eye disease carries no risk of falls. It “may impact contrast sensitivity, making it difficult for people to discern changes in lighting and detect potential hazards, especially in low-light conditions,” she says. “People in the early stages of eye disease may not have fully adapted to changes and as a result, they may be less skilled at compensating for vision loss, making them more vulnerable to falls.” That’s why it’s critical for people 65 and over to have a comprehensive eye exam every year or two, as recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. “Eye diseases that affect vision are more common with age,” Andreoli says. “Timely diagnosis and management is essential to controlling some of these diseases.” Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Women’s Health, Prevention, Health and Reader's Digest.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 clear sentences:

The article explores the relationship between three common eye diseases - cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma - and the risk of falls among older adults. The study found that individuals with these vision loss problems had a 33% higher odds of falling, with an increased risk of injury to various parts of the body. Notably, even relatively mild vision loss can affect balance, posture, and gait, increasing the risk of falls, and the risk is further compounded by other age-related health conditions and medications. Regular comprehensive eye exams are recommended to detect and manage eye diseases, which can help prevent falls.",224

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/pain-reliever-risks/,"Hidden Dangers of Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers Nonprescription medicines are not without risks. Here’s what you need to know By Rachel Nania, Updated April 11, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published June 30, 2021 / Updated April 11, 2024 Getty Images Drugstore shelves are overflowing with options for pain relief. There are packages of pills, patches, creams and liquids — all designed to alleviate everyday aches and injuries. Older adults are the largest consumers of these over-the-counter (OTC) medications, research shows. About half of Americans ages 50 to 80 take two or more nonprescription medications, including supplements, a 2020 report from the University of Michigan’s National Poll on Healthy Aging found. But just because something is sold without a prescription doesn’t mean it’s risk-free, says Amy Thompson, associate chair in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy and clinical associate professor at University of Michigan’s College of Pharmacy. “And those risks heighten as we age,” she adds. Here’s what you need to know before you pop an OTC pain reliever. Acetaminophen Also known by brand name Tylenol Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used drugs in the U.S. and is the top recommended OTC pain relief option for most older adults. It can be used to ease headaches and muscle aches and to reduce fever. It’s also good for helping with osteoarthritis — the type of arthritis that comes from everyday wear and tear, says K. Ashley Garling, clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s College of Pharmacy. But because too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage, certain people should reduce their dosage or avoid it altogether. Talk to your doctor before taking acetaminophen if you have liver disease or drink three or more alcoholic beverages per day. Alcohol causes the liver to convert more of the acetaminophen into toxic byproducts; if these toxins build up, damage can result. Otherwise, Garling says “as long as your overall daily dose is under 3,000 milligrams, it’s usually fairly safe.” Taking a higher dose than recommended will not provide more relief and can be dangerous, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says. The danger is often disguised But keeping your daily dose under 3,000 milligrams per day can be tricky, especially since acetaminophen shows up in hundreds of other medications, including OTC cold and flu relief and allergy medicines. “And so people might be taking Tylenol for their knee pain and then taking NyQuil for a cold, not realizing there’s Tylenol in both of them. They could easily be exceeding the daily dose without even realizing it,” Thompson says. Be sure to pay close attention to the label, as overdosing on acetaminophen is the most common cause of drug-related liver injury. Acetaminophen isn’t always spelled out; abbreviations such as APAP, Acetaminoph, Acetaminop, Acetamin or Acetam may be used instead, the FDA says. What to know about ‘PM’ pain relievers Older adults should avoid the nighttime version of any pain reliever, says Hillary Lum, a geriatrician and associate professor in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. These medicines often contain diphenhydramine, an antihistamine that can aid sleep — thus the “PM” that’s often in the product name, indicating it should be taken at night. But they can also cause falls, confusion, blurred vision and urinary problems in older adults. What’s more, diphenhydramine has been linked in studies to increased dementia risks. If a nighttime pain reliever is being used primarily as a sleep aid, talk to your doctor about alternatives. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Also known as ibuprofen (brand names Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) NSAIDs are another class of pain relievers sold over the counter. They’re helpful at reducing pain caused by inflammation — like arthritis or an athletic injury — and can also aid with fevers and mild pain from headaches and muscle aches. But NSAIDs are not recommended for everyone, and older adults are often advised to avoid them, or at least use them with caution. That’s because they can come with a list of increased risks for people age 50 and above. Bleeding, heart problems and other hidden dangers Use of NSAIDs can cause bleeding in the stomach or in the digestive tract, which can come on without warning signs and can be serious. People who take NSAIDs every day or regularly are at increased risk for these adverse events, according to the FDA. The risk is also higher for adults older than 65, people with a history of stomach ulcers and people who take blood thinners like warfarin or corticosteroids such as prednisone. Adults with blood pressure problems should know that NSAIDs can raise blood pressure. And all NSAIDs, except for aspirin, can increase chances of heart attack or stroke, even after the first few weeks of use. People who have cardiovascular disease are at highest risk. NSAIDs have also been linked to kidney injury in older adults, “which is something I really worry about, too,” Thompson says. “As we age, we really depend on [lipids in the body called] prostaglandins to keep the blood flow to our kidneys. And the way [NSAIDs] work is they inhibit those prostaglandins,” causing the blood vessels to constrict, which can result in kidney injury. Finally, NSAIDs carry the risk of potential skin reactions, the FDA warns. Patients should be on the lookout for symptoms of skin reddening, rash or blisters. “So you really want to leave [NSAIDs] as kind of your last choice, which is interesting, because most people go to these first. But when you’re over 50, this one needs to start moving down the list, versus something like a Tylenol,” Garling says. What to know about aspirin Aspirin is an NSAID, but it’s generally not recommended for pain relief in older adults because it can cause bleeding in the stomach and the brain, and the bleeding risk increases with age. Other OTC remedies are more effective at mitigating pain, both Garling and Thompson say. Where aspirin can come in handy is as a preventive therapy for people who have cardiovascular disease or who have already had a heart attack or stroke. Regular use can reduce risks of another cardiovascular event by keeping the blood from clotting and increasing blood flow to the heart and brain. It is not recommended to prevent first-time heart problems, though it is often misused as such. According to a March 2024 report from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, sponsored by AARP, 14 percent of adults ages 50 to 80 take aspirin regularly even though they have no history of cardiovascular issues. Always check with your health care provider before starting aspirin therapy to weigh the benefits and the risks and to make sure any OTC and prescription medications you’re taking are OK alongside aspirin — otherwise “you could be doing your body more harm than good,” the FDA says. Topical pain relievers Not all pain relievers come in a pill. Topical medications — gels, creams, patches and sprays — can be effective at targeting pain, especially local pain in muscles and joints. Plus, if you’re worried about side effects from pills, topical pain relievers carry less of a risk “because there’s less systemic absorption,” Thompson says. Topical NSAIDs: Some OTC creams contain NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium (brand name Voltaren), which is a popular and effective medicine for treating arthritis pain. The typical side effects of NSAIDs are less of a concern with topicals, but they still need to be considered, especially for people with a history of stomach and heart issues. Lidocaine and menthol: A key ingredient in other topical pain relievers is lidocaine. It provides a numbing effect that can “really help with that more acute, stabbing pain sort of feeling,” Garling says. Menthol, which has a cooling sensation, is another common active ingredient in pain-relieving creams and sprays. Capsaicin: If you’re a fan of spicy foods, you may be familiar with capsaicin, since it’s the compound that gives hot peppers their kick. But it also helps block pain signals in the body and can be a safe and effective way to relieve joint and muscle pain, as well as neuropathy, or pain from nerve damage in the hands and feet, often experienced by diabetics, Garling says. Just be sure to wash your hands after you rub it on your skin — you don’t want capsaicin getting in your eyes. And don’t give up on it too soon, Garling says. “The biggest caveat to this one is that you do have to use it regularly.... Sometimes it takes up to two weeks before you notice a huge difference.” One downside to topical pain relievers is that they often cost more than their oral counterparts, Thompson says. A 5.3-ounce tube of Voltaren, for example, is about $28, whereas a bottle containing 50 ibuprofen pills is about $5. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist The key takeaway to OTC pain medication is to keep your health care provider in the loop, Lum says — especially “given that there are now more and more prescription-strength medications that are over-the-counter and the package inserts are really difficult to understand.” Her advice? Bring a list of everything you are taking, “including your supplements and your over-the-counter medication” to your provider at least once a year. Don’t forget to add any CBD (cannabidiol) use to this list, Lum says. Oils, lotions and gummies containing CBD have become prevalent, especially as an alternative pain reliever, and just like any other OTC substance, your doctor should know if you’re using it. And remember: If you’re stumped in the medicine aisle, check in with the pharmacist for guidance. “We’re the only ones that you can walk up to in your CVS and your local drugstore and talk to within seconds,” Garling says. “And if we’re back there behind the computer, don’t be afraid to ask for us — because we actually love questions.” Editor’s note: This story, first published June 30, 2021, has been updated to include new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/superfoods-for-eyes/,"The Top 12 Best Superfoods for Your Eyes Protect your vision with these nutritious (and delicious) foods Video: AARP Explains: These Meals Help Keep Your Eyes Healthy By Selene Yeager and Stacey Colino, Updated March 17, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published January 07, 2019 / Updated March 17, 2025 Diet can have long-term effect on eye health and there is evidence that good nutrition is important for protecting eyes as we age. Studies have connected a diet rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory foods with reduced risk of the most common age-related eye diseases including cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Following are foods packed with the vitamins and minerals you need to help protect your eyes. Getty Images 1. Blueberries These violet-hued gems are rich in anthocyanins, potent antioxidants that bolster collagen structure in the retina and provide extra vision protection, notes Johanna Seddon, M.D., an expert on macular degeneration and coauthor of Eat Right for Your Sight. They also may improve vision in people with normal tension glaucoma, a form of the disease that damages the optic nerve. If you spend a lot of time in the sun, anthocyanins can protect your retina against damage from UV light exposure. You’ll also get anthocyanins from other purple, blue and dark red foods like red or purple grapes, blackberries, pomegranates and cranberries. Getty Images 2. Dark Chocolate Here’s a guilt-free reason to indulge in a chunk of dark chocolate today: A 2018 study published in JAMA Ophthalmology found that adults who ate a bar of dark chocolate could literally see better — with greater improvements in visual clarity and visual contrast sensitivity— about two hours afterward than those who consumed milk chocolate. Even if your Dove bar doesn’t sharpen your vision, the flavonoids found in dark chocolate may help improve vision in people with glaucoma as well as reduce the risk for macular degeneration. But consume in moderation, or you’ll have other health issues to worry about! Getty Images 3. Eggs The high price of eggs may be worth it if you want to eat to protect your vision. Egg yolks are loaded with the same powerful eye-protecting antioxidants, lutein and zeaxanthin, that are found in leafy green vegetables, notes Marguerite McDonald, M.D., clinical professor of ophthalmology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. The beauty of getting them in your omelets is that the high fat content in eggs means that you can easily absorb all that antioxidant goodness. A 2020 study in the journal Clinical Nutrition found that people who consume two to four eggs per week have a significantly lower risk of developing late-stage age-related macular degeneration than those who consume one egg or less per week over 15 years. Egg yolks﻿ are also a rich source of choline, which plays an important role in eye health﻿, and vitamin D, which may also help protect against macular degeneration. Getty Images 4. Oysters Shellfish like oysters are among the best sources of the mineral zinc, which protects the eyes against the damaging effects of sunlight, McDonald notes. In high doses, zinc also appears to slow the progression of macular degeneration once you have early stages of the disease. But you don’t need more than the recommended dose — 8 milligrams a day for women and 11 milligrams a day for men. Oysters deliver more of the mineral than any other food, but you also can get plenty of zinc from lean red meat, poultry, beans, legumes and fortified cereals. Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images 5. Oranges ﻿ Vitamin C should really be called ""vitamin See"" because it has such a profound effect on vision. Like other antioxidants, it helps protect against free-radical damage and may reduce your risk of developing cataracts and macular degeneration. It also helps build collagen, which provides structure for your cornea. You can also get ample doses of C from other citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, red bell pepper, cantaloupe and broccoli. Getty Images 6. Carrots ﻿ No list of sight-saving foods would be complete without﻿ carrots — after all, as the joke goes, you never see a rabbit wearing glasses. Bad Bugs Bunny yuks aside, carrots are a rich source of beta-carotene, an antioxidant carotenoid that your body converts to vitamin A, which is essential for good vision. Vitamin A helps with the production of both rod and cone cells in the eyes, which help you see in low light conditions and see colors. Beta-carotene also helps fend off disease-causing free-radical damage to the eyes. Eating large amounts may lower your risk for diseases like macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma. You can get beta-carotene from yellow, orange and red fruits and veggies like sweet potatoes and cantaloupes as well as dark leafy greens like kale and broccoli. Getty Images ﻿7﻿. Almonds ﻿ Almonds are great sources of vitamin E, an antioxidant that protects the eyes from free-radical damage. Research has also found that people over age 50 who have a high dietary intake of vitamin E — along with vitamin C, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids — have a substantially lower risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. The recommended daily intake of this antioxidant vitamin is 15 milligrams, the amount in about 2 ounces of almonds. Other good sources of vitamin E include sunflower seeds, hazelnuts, vegetable oils, peanuts and peanut butter. Getty Images 8. Salmon “Getting omega-3 fatty acids matters for maintaining healthy eyes,” says Sunir J. Garg, M.D﻿.﻿, a retina surgeon at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. A ﻿ 2021 meta-analysis of studies in the journal Clinical Nutrition﻿ examined dietary patterns﻿ and the risk of age-related macular degeneration and found that people who regularly ate fish had up to a 29 percent reduced risk of developing the sight-stealing disease. Aim for two to three servings a week of cold-water fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines,﻿ herring, mackerel or halibut. Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images 9. Kale Kale, spinach and other dark leafy greens like collard greens and turnip greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that are stored in the eye’s macula, which helps shield the eye from damaging light. Lutein is especially good at filtering out blue light, which is the kind that emanates from the screens of digital devices. ﻿ These antioxidants also appear to help promote rich blood flow to your eyes. Lutein and zeaxanthin are fat soluble, so drizzle olive oil onto kale for maximum absorption — and deliciousness. Getty Images 10. Tomatoes Tomatoes contain a positive quadruple whammy of nutrients that protect eye health: lycopene, which is part of the carotenoid family, as well as the antioxidants lutein, zeaxanthin and beta-carotene. The antioxidants can help protect against UV-induced damage and the development of cataracts. And lycopene may play a role in preventing age-related macular degeneration: A ﻿ study in a 2022 issue of ﻿Frontiers in Nutrition﻿ found that people with higher blood levels of lutein and zeaxanthin have a significantly lower risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. Other good sources of lycopene include watermelon, pink grapefruit, papaya and dried apricots.﻿﻿ 11. Orange and yellow bell peppers “Bright orange and yellow peppers contain high levels of lutein and zeaxanthin,” says Rudrani Banik, M.D., an integrative neuro-ophthalmologist in New York City and found of The Eye Health Summit, a global event dedicated to integrative eye health. “These yellow-pigmented nutrients shield the retina from high-energy blue light and can protect against digital eye strain and macular degeneration.” As an added perk for your peepers: These bell peppers are excellent sources of vitamin C, and red bell peppers are rich in beta-carotene, too. 12. Turmeric Often used in curries, soups, and stews, “this bright yellow spice contains an active ingredient, curcumin, which has potent anti-inflammatory properties,” Banik says. Researchh as found that curcumin may be useful in treating some retinal disorders. Because it has antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory effects, curcumin has been shown to exert protective effects against dry eye, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. The positive effects are so compelling that curcumin consumption is even included in a recently developed food pyramid designed to prevent or help treat age-related eye conditions. In addition to incorporating turmeric in soups and stews, you can add small amounts—such as ¼ to ½ teaspoon—into tea or hot milk for a healthy treat, Banik says.

Just rush up a flight or two of stairs for the first time in a long time, and you may find yourself briefly gasping for air. But if you suddenly or regularly feel hungry for air without that kind of obvious explanation, that’s another matter, doctors say. Most often, it means trouble with your heart, your lungs, or both, says Nitin Budhwar, M.D., chief of geriatric medicine at the University of New Mexico. “It is not normal to feel short of breath,” he says. “People shouldn’t just accept it as part of life” or “a normal part of aging.” Healthy lungs “don’t wear out,” so shortness of breath should always be checked out, says Brian Christman, M.D., a spokesperson for the American Lung Association and a professor and vice chair for clinical affairs at Vanderbilt University’s School of Medicine. Dyspnea, the medical term for shortness of breath, can have many causes. The likely suspects vary, depending partly on whether the problem is chronic, meaning it’s been developing for a while, or is acute, meaning it started suddenly. Here are some of the most common causes in each situation. Causes of chronic shortness of breath Someone with chronic shortness of breath might tell their doctor that they’ve noticed a gradual change — that “a year ago I could walk two miles, and now it's 150 feet to my mailbox, and I'm short of breath when I come back,” Christman says. That’s “a real change,” he says, and should start a conversation about what else is going on, including any new or worsening health problems. Often, such chronic breathlessness has multiple, related causes, Budhwar says, many of which can be effectively treated. Among the possibilities: 1. Asthma If you’ve had asthma your whole life, you know that shortness of breath, along with wheezing and other symptoms, can be signs of an attack. But if you’ve never been diagnosed with asthma, don’t rule it out if you notice such symptoms coming and going, Christman says. “You can get asthma as you get older,” he says, because of changes in your immune system or your environment. 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is an umbrella term for lung conditions, including emphysema, that cause swelling and irritation inside airways, making it harder for air to flow through the lungs. Smoking is the most common cause, and asthma increases the risk. Along with shortness of breath, symptoms can include coughing, wheezing and bringing up mucus. 3. Heart failure Having this condition means your heart can’t pump enough blood because of damage that leaves it too weak or stiff. It can develop gradually or suddenly. It can cause shortness of breath when you’re active but also when you’re lying down. You might also have symptoms like leg swelling and tiredness. Your doctor is more likely to suspect heart failure if you have a history of heart attacks, high blood pressure, diabetes or other conditions that raise the risk, Christman says. 4. Coronary artery disease This is the kind of heart disease in which plaque builds up in your arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart. Eventually, it can cause a heart attack. But even before that, you can have symptoms such as chest pain (angina) and shortness of breath. 5. Lung inflammation and scarring If you have certain autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, or a history of exposure to certain substances, like asbestos or silica, you could have one of a group of conditions called interstitial lung disease. These can cause inflammation and scarring that make it harder for you to move oxygen out of your lungs and into the rest of your body. 6. Obesity If you’ve put on a lot of weight, especially around your belly, the added fat under your skin and around your organs leaves less room for your lungs to expand, Budhwar says. There’s also “more of you to haul around,” so more strain on your lungs, he says. 7. Deconditioning Getting much less active — which can go hand in hand with weight gain but can also happen when you spend a long time recovering from injury, illness or surgery — can take a big toll on your heart and lung fitness, leaving you breathless from activities you used to handle with more ease. That’s especially true if you’re older and frailer to begin with, Christman says. If you have chronic shortness of breath, expect your doctor to ask a lot of questions before ordering any medical testing, Budhwar and Christman say. Your answers, and your medical history, “really dictate which way the workup is going to go” and whether you need to see a specialist, Budhwar says. Depending on the cause or causes, treatments may include medicines, specialized exercise and rehabilitation programs or other approaches. Causes of acute shortness of breath If you were breathing just fine yesterday or an hour ago and now you are struggling to get enough air, “that really needs an urgent workup,” meaning a trip to an emergency room or a call to 911, Budhwar says. Here are some possible causes of sudden shortness of breath: 1. Heart attack “You can have a heart attack without clear chest pain” but with shortness of breath and other possible symptoms, Christman says. Other symptoms can include discomfort in your jaw, neck, shoulders or arms, as well as nausea, lightheadedness and tiredness, according to the American Heart Association. Heart attacks without chest pain are especially common in women and people with diabetes, Christman says. 2. Heart rhythm problems A suddenly racing heart and shortness of breath could be signs of a serious heart rhythm problem, such as atrial fibrillation (AFib), which is linked to stroke. “If you suddenly flip [to] a high rate, that will make you short of breath,” Christman says. “It’s like running uphill all day.” 3. Pneumonia Shortness of breath combined with a fever and, sometimes, chest pain could mean you have a lung infection, Christman says. Many kinds of bacteria, fungi and viruses, including COVID-19, can cause pneumonia. 4. Collapsed lung Chest pain on one side and pain when you take a deep breath could mean a pneumothorax, or collapsed lung, Christman says. This can happen after an injury, with some diseases or after a medical procedure in which a needle is inserted in the chest. 5. Pulmonary embolism This is a blood clot that stops blood flow to an artery in the lung. “Think of it like a lung attack,” Budhwar says. These clots often travel from the legs. Symptoms can include chest pain and fainting, as well as shortness of breath. 6. Internal bleeding You may get blood tests for anemia — low levels of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through your body. When shortness of breath and anemia suddenly show up together, it could be a sign of serious internal bleeding, Budhwar says, from causes like a ruptured ulcer or an aneurysm (weakened blood vessel). It’s important, he says, to find where the bleeding is coming from and stop it. 7. Anxiety For some people, severe anxiety can lead to panic attacks. In a typical attack, “suddenly you feel you're going to die and you're short of breath and feel like everything's closing in,” Christman says. Before you get that diagnosis, though, doctors should make sure that there isn’t a physical problem causing the symptoms, he and Budhwar say. Finding the cause of any sudden shortness of breath is urgent, the doctors say, so you can get the right treatment. In some cases, quick treatment might even save your life.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/xec-covid-variant/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by The New XEC COVID Variant: 5 Things to Know Health officials are keeping a close eye on the latest strain of the coronavirus By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published September 18, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Shutterstock) COVID-19’s summer surge is starting to cool off, the latest national data shows, but public health experts urge people not to let their guard down. Cases and hospitalizations remain elevated, particularly among older adults and younger children, a Sept. 13 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. Plus, COVID activity historically spikes in the fall and winter months when more people are indoors. There’s also a new coronavirus variant that public health officials and virologists are keeping a close eye on. The strain, known as XEC, has been detected in several countries, including the U.S., where a handful of cases have been reported. “[XEC] is starting to really show evidence of being the most rapidly increasing variant that’s causing COVID right now,” says Andrew Pekosz, a professor in the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It “appears to be the most likely one to get legs next,” Eric Topol, M.D., founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, wrote on the social media platform X. Here’s what you need to know about XEC, including how to amp up your protection against the COVID variant. 1. XEC is a hybrid variant Researchers refer to the XEC variant, which is in the omicron family, as a recombinant virus — a hybrid of two other variants. “I think that’s another reason why people are interested in following [XEC] right now, because [recombinant] variants oftentimes have very unpredictable results, because they’re basically resulting from two different variants sort of coming together and exchanging their genes,” Pekosz says. XEC is a mix of KP.3.3 — an offshoot of KP.3, one of the FLiRT variants that drove the summer surge — and KS.1.1. 2. New vaccines should be a good match Though XEC has drifted from the variants that newly updated vaccines target (KP.2 for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccines, and JN.1 for Novavax’s shot), it shares similarities, so this year’s vaccines should be “a very good match” against the new variant, Pekosz says. “From a vaccine perspective, this is one that should be recognized by the immune response induced by vaccination,” he explains. “[People] can go out and get their vaccine, and it'll work against this variant, as well as many of the ones that are circulating right now.” Getting vaccinated against COVID is especially important for older adults, who are at higher risk of becoming seriously sick from a coronavirus infection. This year’s updated vaccines are available in pharmacies and clinics throughout the U.S. Doctors say it’s safe to get your COVID vaccine, flu shot and RSV vaccine at the same time. 3. Cases remain low in U.S. — but that could change Most cases of COVID-19 caused by XEC have been reported overseas, primarily in Europe. “It hasn’t gotten to the United States yet in any significant numbers,” Pekosz says — though this could change. According to outbreak.info, a COVID-19 tracker from Scripps, 23 cases of COVID-19 caused by XEC had been identified in the U.S. as of Sept. 3. The dominant variant in the U.S. is KP3.1.1, which accounts for more than half of coronavirus infections. ﻿ Even if XEC does spread more in the U.S., “there’s no clear evidence” that it would become a dominant variant, Pekosz says. It may fold into the “swarm of variants,” like the FliRT variants and others, causing infections in the U.S. over the past several months. “This may simply become one of those variants that’s circulating together in the population,” Pekosz says.﻿ 4. Symptoms don’t appear more severe Scientists are still studying XEC, but “so far nothing jumps out in terms of having a different disease pattern with this variant yet,” Pekosz says. Meaning the symptoms you get from an infection caused by XEC are most likely going to be similar to symptoms you’d experience from another omicron variant. According to the CDC, common symptoms of COVID-19 can include: Fever or chillsCoughShortness of breath or difficulty breathingSore throatCongestion or runny noseNew loss of taste or smellFatigueMuscle or body achesHeadacheNausea or vomitingDiarrhea “But again, it’s very early. So we need a little bit more data to see if that’s happening,” Pekosz says. “Right now, the only thing that’s clear is that it seems to be the fastest increasing variant in parts of Europe, in particular.” 5. Older adults should get a plan in place News of a new variant serves as a reminder that “this is a great time to get prepared” for the fall and winter virus season, Pekosz says. In addition to getting vaccinated, he says, now is the time to stock up on home test kits, so if you experience COVID-like symptoms, you can test yourself for the virus and, if positive, talk to your doctor about antiviral treatments to keep an infection from turning severe. The government is relaunching its COVID home test kit program later in September. U.S. households will be able to order four free coronavirus tests shipped to their homes. There are also home tests on the market that can tell you if you have COVID or flu, Pekosz notes. As with COVID, antiviral treatments can keep an influenza infection from turning severe, and these medications work best when started right away.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/ice-baths-cold-water-swimming-benefits/,"Are Ice Baths and Cold-water Swimming Good for Your Health? These chilly trends have risks, but they may have benefits, too. If you want to try it, we’ve got six tips to get you started. By Kim Painter, AARP Comments En español Published October 18, 2023 Getty Images Leslie Mazur, a 47-year-old physician assistant from Littleton, Colorado, plunges into tubs of icy water on a regular basis. She says it soothes her aching knees and back, relieves anxiety, lifts her mood and helps her sleep. Her partner, Ladd Richland, a 60-year-old ski instructor and life coach from Breckenridge, Colorado, is a cold-plunger too. He says that by combining meditative breathing with cold-water dunks, he’s training his mind to handle other challenges. Karen Šulek, 53, an executive leadership coach from Reston, Virginia, says that she emerges from dips in chilly lakes and rivers feeling like a “beautiful piece of polished silver.” She thinks her cold-water swimming habit is one reason she rarely gets sick. Help for sore muscles, exercise recovery Scientists looking at the physical and mental effects of intentional cold-water exposure — in icy tubs, cold showers and chilly natural waters — say such enthusiasts may be on to something. It’s possible, they say, that the benefits go beyond relieving soreness and aiding exercise recovery, the best-studied uses. But large, well-designed studies that firmly back up broader health benefits are lacking, they say. “We know a lot about the potential risks, in terms of the science, and far less about the potential benefits,” says Heather Massey, a senior lecturer in sport, health and exercise science at the University of Portsmouth, in the United Kingdom. Karen Šulek regularly enjoys cold-water swimming, along with friends and family. Top photo left to right: Karen Šulek, Dagmar Sageder, Júlia Brecelyová, Ria Kalivodová, Andrej Šulek, Ivan Schun, Jozef Petrovič.

Courtesy Karen Šulek Still, interest is high, thanks in part to celebrities such as Kristen Bell, 43; Madonna, 65; and Josh Brolin, 55, sharing ice-bathing photos on social media. Massey, a cold-water swimmer herself, is among those trying to help science catch up with the popular interest. She’s working on a large study that might show whether people who swim in cold water reduce their risk of depression. A smaller pilot study was promising, she says. Improvements for immunity, blood sugar? Other preliminary studies have suggested regular cold-water immersion might improve blood sugar regulation, boost immunity, lower levels of harmful blood fats and alter body fat in helpful ways, says James Mercer, a professor emeritus at the Arctic University of Norway’s Institute of Health Sciences. But in a published review of research done mostly in cold-water swimmers, Mercer and his colleagues cautioned that findings remained hard to interpret. The studies, which used using varying water temperatures, methods and types of people, haven’t sorted out the direct effects of cold water from the effects of being outdoors, exercising and doing something challenging with other people, Mercer says. “There are some studies showing the cold air alone is enough to trigger some of these responses,” he says. “So, you could argue that you don't have to go in cold water at all.” With all that said, here’s what experts say happens when you put your body in very cold water – including what can go wrong: Karen Šulek regularly enjoys cold-water swimming, along with friends and family. Top photo left to right: Karen Šulek, Dagmar Sageder, Júlia Brecelyová, Ria Kalivodová, Andrej Šulek, Ivan Schun, Jozef Petrovič. Bottom left photo: Ivan Schun, Dagmar Sageder, Júlia Brecelyová, Ľubor Šramo, Karen Šulek, Andrej Šulek, Sofia Šulek. Bottom right photo: Andrej, Sofia and Karen Šulek, Ľubor Šramo. Courtesy Karen Šulek • The cold-shock response Getting in cold water, “is a very shocking experience,” Massey says. You gasp for breath as your heart rate, blood pressure and stress hormones spike. This can happen in even mildly chilly water, but peaks at 50-59-degrees Fahrenheit, Massey and her colleagues have reported. In swimmers, cold shock diminishes with repeated dips. That kind of adaptation could, theoretically, help people handle other stresses in life, Massey says. But cold shock also can be dangerous, occasionally triggering heart rhythm problems. That’s one reason people with heart conditions should check with their doctors before going in cold water, she says. Cold shock also can lead to drowning if people gasping for air put their heads under water. • Diving response If you do put your face in the water, you also can trigger the so-called diving response, which “has a real calming effect,” and causes your heart rate to fall, Massey says. But if your heart is still racing from cold shock, that’s like hitting the brake and accelerator at the same time, and could increase the risks of heart rhythm problems, she says. Once the cold shock passes and “you can speak in full sentences,” it’s safe to get your face wet, she says. • A cooling body Cold water can immediately reduce pain by numbing nerves, says Dominic King, D.O., a sports medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinic. Also, as blood vessels constrict to limit heat loss, blood flow is reduced, lowering inflammation, at least temporarily, he says. Some studies also show dramatic increases in mood-lifting brain chemicals, such as dopamine. Regular cold exposure produces additional physiological changes, including an increase in brown fat, which may increase calorie burn and have other metabolic effects, Mercer says. • Hypothermia risks Stay in too long and you risk hypothermia, a dangerously low body temperature, says Mark Harper, M.D., a consultant anesthetist at Sussex University Hospitals in the United Kingdom and Kristiansand in Norway. How long is too long differs, says Harper, the author of Chill: The Cold Water Swimming Cure. For example, he says that when he jumps in a cold lake after a long bike ride, he stays warmer longer than if he just got out of a car. In general, he and Massey say, benefits peak after a few minutes, while risks rise. Signs of hypothermia, such as mumbling speech and fumbling movements, require medical attention, she says. • Aftereffects Your body temperature may fall even after you get out of the water, so it’s important to get into warm, dry clothes quickly and to avoid driving until you are sure you are OK, Massey says. Sulek, the cold-water swimmer, says she and her friends have safely gone into water so cold that they need to break ice to get in, near her second home outside Bratislava, Slovakia. In winter, she says, they wear scuba gloves, booties and hats, and get out after a few minutes. Then, they run to one of their houses and sit by a fire. The rewarming, she says, is one of the best parts: “You feel a glow inside.” Mazur and Richland, the Colorado couple, say they see their plunges in icy tubs as part of their meditation practice. “It's a great way to get out of your mind and get into your body,” Mazur says. “It clears my head. It’s just kind of the next level.” It’s about “really tapping into the possibilities of what our minds and bodies are capable of,” Richland says. Tips for trying cold-water immersion safely If you want to try cold-water immersion in the safest way possible, Dominic King, D.O., of the Cleveland Clinic, offers six tips to get started. 1. Check first with your doctor, especially if you have an injury, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, breathing problems or any condition that limits cold tolerance. Even if you feel safe, always have other people nearby when you get in cold water. 2. Get a water thermometer and use it in your home bathtub. For most people, a starting temperature of 65 to 68 degrees will be plenty cold. 3. If you aren’t ready to put your whole body in, start with your feet and legs and work your way up. Once you can sit for 30 seconds, try next time to sit longer or to lower the temperature, by adding ice, if needed. Don’t go colder and longer at the same time. While some people like the challenge of using much colder water, King says there’s no evidence for benefits below 55 degrees Fahrenheit or so. 4. Focus on breathing. “Try really deep slow breaths to stay calm and reduce stress.” 5. Have warm towels and clothes ready to use when you emerge. Maybe do a little light exercise to warm up. Drink fluids, because cold exposure can cause dehydration. 6. Another option: Try a cold shower, which tends to be less intense. If you find that miserable, cold immersion might not be for you. Whole-body cryotherapy is offered in many fitness clubs and spas. Jacob Ammentorp Lund / Getty Images Whole-body cryotherapy If a little cold water might be good for you, how about cold air – very cold air? That’s the idea behind so-called whole-body cryotherapy (WBC). The version offered in many fitness clubs and spas involves standing or sitting for two to four minutes in a super-cooled room or in a one-person chamber that leaves your head sticking out. Temperatures inside can be as low as minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You’ll find online claims that cryotherapy can reduce soreness after exercise, lift mood, help with weight loss and tighten skin. Some providers have touted benefits for people with conditions including asthma, Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis, the FDA said in a consumer update published in 2016. At that time, the FDA said there was no convincing evidence for any of the claims. It has not updated its advice since then. It’s plausible that very cold air might have some health benefits, just as cold water seems to, but “I just don’t know how much of an effect,” says cold-water researcher Mark Harper. Some research has looked at whole-body cryotherapy for treating muscle soreness in athletes and found no advantages over cold water, says researcher Heather Massey. One review of four muscle pain studies found the research was of “very low quality.” A review of 10 studies of people treated in super-cooled rooms, with their heads and bodies exposed, found preliminary evidence that the treatment eased mental health problems, especially depression. But the researchers said larger studies with longer follow-up were needed. The American Academy of Dermatology warns that whole-body cryotherapy users have reported frostbite, rashes and other cold-related injuries. Because of such risks, it’s “really important exposure is very short – a maximum of a couple of minutes,” Massey says, and that users wear warm footwear, thick gloves and, if needed, a hat or headband to protect the ears. Costs for cryotherapy vary, with single sessions typically advertised for about $40-$65. Whole-body cryotherapy is offered in many fitness clubs and spas.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/different-types-of-bottled-water/,"7 Types of Bottled Water Water, water, everywhere. Is one variety healthier than others? By Andrea Wickstrom, Updated April 15, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published April 12, 2024 / Updated April 15, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Shutterstock; Getty Images(2)) Standing in front of the water aisle in stores can feel overwhelming. Once we filled our glasses with the simplest drink that just flowed from the tap, but now the choices are dizzying: vitamin water, hydrogen water, sparkling water, electrolyte water. Americans spent an estimated $49 billion in 2023 on bottled water and drank about 16 billion gallons, according to the Beverage Marketing Corp. That’s a lot of bottled-up H2O. Though it’s true that staying hydrated is crucial to overall health — and many older adults are dehydrated — it’s not clear whether spending extra money on something that’s included in your monthly water bill can make you any healthier. 6 Risks of Dehydration Older people are at higher risk of dehydration, due in part to decrease in thirst. In some older adults, the loss of just 2 to 3 percent of body fluid can cause physical and cognitive problems. One study found up to 40 percent of older adults may be underhydrated. Dehydration is linked to diabetes, heart failure and stroke and can lead to: Delirium Confusion Infections Falls Fractures Seizures See also, Do You Really Need 8 Glasses of Water a Day? How are all the drinking water choices different, and is one better than another? Tap water In general, the United States has some of the world’s safest drinking water. Some U.S. water is safe to drink directly from the source, while water from other sources must be treated before consumption because of potential chemical and bacterial contamination. On April 10, the Biden administration finalized limits on “forever chemicals” in drinking water, requiring utilities to reduce them to the lowest level that can be reliably measured. Government officials say these chemicals, called PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl substances), are linked to liver disease, heart disease and certain cancers. The administration has also proposed rules that would require cities to replace lead water pipes within 10 years. An estimated 43 million Americans receive water from a private underground well. Well water can be cloudy, have a rotten egg odor from hydrogen sulfide, and leave rust stains. This water is not regulated, so homeowners are responsible for ensuring their supply is safe for drinking, usually through recommended annual testing. Other than private well water, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates and monitors public water supply and tests and treats the water. Water that doesn’t taste or smell good may be confused with water that is not good for you. A safe amount of chlorine kills bacteria and viruses and keeps water pipes clean, but it doesn’t taste good. Chlorine can be removed with a filter. “Water can sometimes have a bad smell, taste or appearance, but these features don’t usually last long or indicate a public health concern,” says registered dietitian Kourtney Johnson. “Chlorine, chemicals or a medicine-like taste or smell don’t typically mean there’s an immediate health threat.” Tap water that doesn’t taste or smell good, as well as news reports of problems with the water coming from our faucets, may explain in part why millions of Americans turn to bottled water. Bottled water The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strictly regulates bottled water production and distribution. The FDA has set out Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) that require bottled water companies to maintain sanitary conditions throughout manufacturing and transportation, protect the approved water sources and test the final product. 6 Risks of Dehydration Older people are at higher risk of dehydration, due in part to decrease in thirst. In some older adults, the loss of just 2 to 3 percent of body fluid can cause physical and cognitive problems. One study found up to 40 percent of older adults may be underhydrated. Dehydration is linked to diabetes, heart failure and stroke and can lead to: Delirium Confusion Infections Falls Fractures Seizures See also, Do You Really Need 8 Glasses of Water a Day? Some sparkling waters, seltzer waters, tonics and club soda aren’t included as bottled water under FDA regulations. They are considered soft drinks. Although experts say bottled water is generally safe, there are a few concerns. Filtered water may remove fluoride, which is safe to drink and helps prevent tooth decay. Sometimes, manufacturers will reintroduce minerals after purification. Microplastics are substances used to give plastic bottles transparency, shape and flexibility. A possible link between plastics and disruption of the endocrine system and thyroid is under investigation. “Growing evidence shows that microplastics negatively affect the endocrine, reproductive and immune systems, as well as bacteria found in the gut. The thyroid plays a role in regulating almost all organs in the body, and long-term exposure to plastics negatively affects its ability to regulate growth, development, metabolism and reproduction,” Johnson says. Water Filters Options to enhance the condition of your home’s well or tap water include: A whole house filtration system. A filtered refrigerator water dispenser. A filtered countertop water pitcher or faucet attachment. A reverse osmosis system. Here’s a breakdown on seven popular varieties of bottled water. 1. Spring water Spring water originates from rainwater that moves underground and is filtered naturally by rock and minerals. After it is pushed up to the ground’s surface, the water is collected in springs. Per FDA regulations, when manufacturers bottle and sell it, it must have the same composition and quality as the spring water at its source. The amount of minerals in spring water isn’t substantial, so it doesn’t provide additional health benefits compared with other water. However, many people enjoy the taste. 2. Mineral water To be labeled mineral water, this type of bottled water must contain at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids. It differs from other types of bottled water due to minerals and trace elements that are present at the water source. Minerals cannot be added later, according to FDA rules. 3. Alkaline water Multiple brands manufacture alkaline water, which is altered to a higher pH. Alkaline water can be more expensive than other bottled water, but studies have yet to prove its health benefits. Some claim it can neutralize acid in the bloodstream, give better workout recovery and help prevent disease. A 2021 Iranian study found it may improve bone density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The science on these claims is limited, and studies are generally small or in animals, not humans. Larger studies are needed to evaluate any potential health benefits. Water Filters Options to enhance the condition of your home’s well or tap water include: A whole house filtration system. A filtered refrigerator water dispenser. A filtered countertop water pitcher or faucet attachment. A reverse osmosis system. “The body does an incredible job at keeping our pH within a very tight and controlled range. Consuming more alkaline water will not shift your pH outside of its normal range,” says Jen Hernandez, a registered dietitian who specializes in helping people with kidney disease. Some suggest drinking alkaline water may help those who suffer from acid reflux, but Hernandez is skeptical. “Adding this type of water into a very acidic environment, like the stomach, which is supposed to be producing acid to help us with digestion and breaking down foods, is almost counterintuitive,” Hernandez says. 4. Water with vitamins Some manufacturers enhance water with vitamins. This water usually comes in sugar-sweetened and sugar-free options. In some brands, a 20-fluid-ounce bottle has up to 27 grams of added sugar (50–100 percent of the daily recommended limit), so those watching sugar content should check labels. Sugar-free options use stevia, monk fruit or artificial sweeteners. Vitamin-infused waters may contain more than 100 percent of the daily recommended value of vitamins B and C. These are water-soluble vitamins, meaning that the kidneys will excrete any excess in your urine. “So you’re just going to pay for expensive urine at that point. ... Your body is going to say, ‘I don't need this quantity,’ ” Hernandez says. “It is ideal to get our vitamins from foods as they provide many other benefits and nutrients.” 5. Electrolyte water Sports drinks are intended for athletes who lose a lot of fluid and electrolytes through sweat. Such drinks often aren’t necessary for moderate exercisers or sedentary people. Electrolyte water may be beneficial short-term under certain circumstances, such as when people are exercising for long periods, have prolonged exposure to heat or are ill with vomiting and diarrhea. Experts say regular water is usually sufficient for meeting moderate exercise hydration needs. 6. Hydrogen water Hydrogen water is plain water with hydrogen gas added to it. The water can be bought with the hydrogen in it, or people can purchase hydrogen tablets to add to water at home. Hydrogen water is gaining interest due to its potential health benefits. A 2024 review of studies found that it may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as improve physical endurance. Most studies have been small, and research is mixed. Further rigorous research is needed to confirm any benefits. 7. Purified water Plain bottled water is not merely tap water in a bottle, although some bottled water does come from municipal sources. To be labeled purified, the water goes into a production plant and through a process that can include distillation, deionization or reverse osmosis, according to the International Bottled Water Association. It is then sold in individual, sanitary, sealed containers. Is one type better? Most people get the electrolytes and minerals they need from food, not fluids. The amount in drinking water is relatively low and not enough to meet our dietary needs. Is there a best daily drinking water? Some say the right water is the one you will drink. Many people enjoy the taste and convenience of bottled water and prefer it to tap water. On the other hand, purified, highly regulated, readily available tap water is likely coming from your kitchen faucet. With additional home filters, cost-effective tap water is an excellent daily drinking choice, and there are no toxins from plastic bottles. Having a pitcher of filtered tap water on the counter at home, in sight as a reminder, can be great for hydration needs, Hernandez says. Hard Water Vs. Soft Water Many households have soft water, but it isn’t a requirement. A water softener removes the water’s hardness, caused by calcium and magnesium, and replaces it with sodium. Some may wonder if their soft water tastes salty. Some sources say that’s a myth; others say people with very discerning taste buds may notice it. The amount of sodium in one 8-ounce glass of softened water is about 12﻿.5 milligrams (the recommended daily intake is 2,300 mg). Soft water is safe for the general public, but those with strict low-sodium diets may need their doctor’s guidance on water selection. To avoid drinking soft water, you can switch to a nonsalt-based softening system (using potassium instead) or add a reverse osmosis system to your kitchen supply. Other solutions include having the water softener hooked up to your hot water to reserve for laundry, bathing and cleaning. Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration Hard Water Vs.

The article explores the various types of bottled water available and whether one variety is healthier than others, highlighting the importance of staying hydrated, particularly for older adults. Key findings suggest that while bottled water is generally safe, the type of water consumed is less important than the fact that one is drinking water, with tap water being a cost-effective and regulated option. A surprising insight is that many marketed health benefits of certain types of bottled water, such as alkaline or vitamin-infused water, are not supported by scientific evidence.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you/,"Are Artificial Sweeteners Bad for You? A WHO warning about aspartame has reignited the decades-long debate By Rachel Nania, Updated June 07, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published April 10, 2023 / Updated June 07, 2024 Getty Images You know that routinely guzzling sugary drinks and scarfing down sweets is not a healthy habit. Doing so can lead to weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other serious diseases and complications. But is replacing all that added sugar with low- and no-calorie sweeteners any healthier? That’s a question of ongoing debate. In July 2023, an agency within the World Health Organization (WHO) named the widely used artificial sweetener aspartame a possible cause of cancer, citing limited evidence of an increased risk for liver cancer in humans. A review by a second group within WHO found the evidence less convincing, however, and said the data “indicated no sufficient reason to change the previously established acceptable daily intake” of aspartame. The group said an adult weighing approximately 150 pounds would need to drink, for example, between nine and 14 cans of diet soda a day to exceed that limit. “The assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies,” Francesco Branca, director of WHO’s Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, said in a statement. Aspartame has been at the center of the sweetener controversy for decades. In addition to possible cancer risk, other studies have linked it to potential health concerns including cardiovascular disease and disruptions in the gut microbiome, a community of microorganisms that live in the digestive tract and help the body carry out various functions. Still, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approved aspartame in 1974 and has studied it since, maintains that the sweetener is safe when “used under the approved conditions.” The FDA responded in disagreement to the WHO group’s assessment, adding that it reviewed the same studies used in the evaluation and “identified significant shortcomings” in the research. Other sweeteners under scrutiny A study published in February 2023 in the journal Nature Medicine found a link between the sweetener erythritol and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Erythritol is a common sugar replacement found in many products marketed for the popular low-carb keto diet. Low amounts occur naturally in some fruits and vegetables; the body also produces low levels of erythritol to aid in energy metabolism. When used as a sweetener, however, erythritol levels are typically 1,000 times greater than levels found naturally in foods, according to a summary of the research from the National Institutes of Health. For the study, a team of researchers from the Cleveland Clinic looked at levels of erythritol in the blood of more than 4,000 adults who were already at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases. What they found was that people with the highest levels of erythritol in their blood were more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. A few other findings to note: When the researchers mixed erythritol with blood samples from healthy individuals, the blood platelets were more likely to clot, which can increase risk for heart attack and stroke. And when a small group of healthy individuals drank a beverage sweetened with the compound, the levels of erythritol in their blood increased 1,000-fold and remained elevated for several days. Senior study author Stanley Hazen, M.D., points out that “the very people who are most vulnerable to heart disease” — people with type 2 diabetes or obesity, for example — are the ones who are more likely to be targeted with foods sweetened with no-calorie sugar substitutes, also called nonnutritive sweeteners. “And yet, by trying to [make a healthy choice], they may inadvertently be contributing to heightened risk,” says Hazen, chairman for the Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences at the Lerner Research Institute and co-section head of preventive cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. ﻿ What a Diet Soda a Day Can Do to Your Heart An analysis of health data from more than 200,000 adults found that people who drink 2 liters or more per week (about 67 ounces) of artificially sweetened drinks — a rough equivalent of about a can of diet soda a day — have about a 20 percent higher risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation, compared to people who consumed none. The risk was 10 percent higher among people who drank similar amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages, the analysis found. Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, is a risk factor for stroke and heart failure. More than 12 million people are expected to have the heart condition by 2030, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study was published March 5, 2024, in Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association. “While there is robust evidence about the adverse effects of sugar-sweetened beverages and cardiovascular disease risk, there is less evidence about adverse health consequences of artificial sweeteners,” Penny Kris-Etherton, an emeritus professor of nutritional sciences at Penn State University, said in a statement from the American Heart Association. “We still need more research on these beverages to confirm these findings and to fully understand all the health consequences on heart disease and other health conditions. In the meantime, water is the best choice, and, based on this study, no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided.” Another sugar alcohol study led by Hazen reached similar findings. Published June 6, 2024, in the European Heart Journal, researchers found that higher amounts of the sugar substitute xylitol — commonly used in sugar-free candy, gums, baked goods and toothpastes — are associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. The researchers note that while xylitol is not as prevalent as erythritol in foods in the U.S., it is common in other countries. The study, which included an analysis of 3,000 participants, “again shows the immediate need for investigating sugar alcohols and artificial sweeteners, especially as they continue to be recommended in combating conditions like obesity or diabetes,” Hazen said in a statement. “It does not mean throw out your toothpaste if it has xylitol in it, but we should be aware that consumption of a product containing high levels could increase the risk of blood clot-related events.” Sweeteners go by many names A number of calorie-free sugar substitutes are on the market — some are referred to as artificial, some natural. And chances are, you’ve consumed them without realizing it. “They’re increasingly used because consumers are concerned about sugar. And so companies are responding to that not with the most obvious thing — making foods less sweet — but they’re using these instead,” says Dariush Mozaffarian, M.D., a cardiologist and professor of nutrition at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. Six artificial sweeteners have been approved by the FDA: Saccharin (Sweet’N Low). You can find it in sugar-free gums and candies, even toothpaste.Aspartame (Equal). You can find it in popular zero-calorie soft drinks.Acesulfame potassium (Sunett, Sweet One). You can find it in frozen desserts, candies, beverages and baked goods.Sucralose (Splenda). You can find this in baked goods, even salad dressings.Neotame (Newtame). You can find this in baked goods.Advantame. This sweetener, with no brand name, is also used in baked goods. There are others, too, that the FDA considers “generally recognized as safe” and that don’t have to go through the same safety review as those on the list above. They include: Luo han guo (Monk Fruit in the Raw)Purified stevia leaf extracts (Truvia)Sugar alcohols, like erythritol. Sugar alcohols are neither sugar nor alcohol but carbohydrates that have chemical characteristics of both, according to the FDA. And while they are found naturally in some fruits and vegetables, the kind you find in packaged products are commercially produced. Other than erythritol, common sugar alcohols include maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol. These nonnutritive sweeteners pop up in a range of products, from yogurts to oatmeal to ice cream. Sometimes they’re mixed with other sweeteners. Wondering if there’s a difference between artificial sweeteners and the so-called natural ones? Mozaffarian says, “That’s a little bit of an artificial distinction,” since many of the natural options are used at levels much higher than a person would consume if they, say, ate a slice of watermelon or a handful of grapes. “Something being natural doesn’t necessarily mean it’s safe at [high] doses,” Mozaffarian says. “At the same time, something artificial doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s harmful.” What a Diet Soda a Day Can Do to Your Heart An analysis of health data from more than 200,000 adults found that people who drink 2 liters or more per week (about 67 ounces) of artificially sweetened drinks — a rough equivalent of about a can of diet soda a day — have about a 20 percent higher risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation, compared to people who consumed none. The risk was 10 percent higher among people who drank similar amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages, the analysis found. Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, is a risk factor for stroke and heart failure. More than 12 million people are expected to have the heart condition by 2030, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study was published March 5, 2024, in Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association. “While there is robust evidence about the adverse effects of sugar-sweetened beverages and cardiovascular disease risk, there is less evidence about adverse health consequences of artificial sweeteners,” Penny Kris-Etherton, an emeritus professor of nutritional sciences at Penn State University, said in a statement from the American Heart Association. “We still need more research on these beverages to confirm these findings and to fully understand all the health consequences on heart disease and other health conditions. In the meantime, water is the best choice, and, based on this study, no- and low-calorie sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided.” Should you make the sweetener switch? There’s no doubt that cutting down on the amount of sugar you consume through foods and drinks can be a boon for your health. And most Americans have some work to do: The average U.S. adult consumes about 77 grams of sugar per day — more than three times the recommended amount for women, according to the American Heart Association. But should you swap the real stuff for a zero-calorie alternative? Not so fast. Mozaffarian says one way to think of nonnutritive sweeteners is more like a bridge and less like a destination. “If you’re going to have a 20-ounce soda, it’s probably better to have a diet [soda]. But, you know, better to have neither,” he says. (The WHO said in May that replacing sugar with zero-sugar sweeteners does not help with weight loss and management over the long term.) If you’re trying to limit your intake of nonnutritive sweeteners, know that doing so can be difficult. They creep into a lot of packaged products, and many people are not familiar with all the varieties on the market. (You may have heard of aspartame — but acesulfame potassium or adventame?) What’s more, manufacturers aren’t required to include sugar alcohols, like erythritol, in the ingredient list on a food’s label. “Sometimes you’ll see it just as natural sweeteners or natural flavors,” the Cleveland Clinic’s Hazen says. A good rule of thumb: “If it tastes sweet and it says low﻿-sugar, it’s likely got one of these in it,” Mozaffarian says. Packages advertised as low-calorie can be another giveaway, adds Martha Field, an assistant professor in the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University. Many experts and organizations stress that more research on sweetener safety is needed, including long-term studies. While we wait, Field says, “it never hurts to be more aware of what you’re eating.” And if you’re concerned about the effects of sugar or sugar substitutes on your health, talk to your doctor or a dietitian, who can “help you sort through some of your personal risks,” Field adds. Another tip to help you avoid added sugar and sugar substitutes: Stick to a diet rich in whole foods as much as possible. “I always recommend to my patients to shop the produce aisle,” Hazen says.﻿ Editor's note: This story, originally published April 10, 2023, has been updated to reflect new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/what-are-polyphenols/,"The Superpowers of Polyphenols 11 foods and drinks high in these plant-based compounds that help protect the body and reduce disease By Lauren David, AARP Comments En español Published February 14, 2025 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (6)) You’ve heard of antioxidants— compounds that protect the body from unstable molecules. But there’s another key nutrient found in many plant-based foods that functions like antioxidants and is getting a lot of attention. Researchers are taking notice and studying how they can help in the fight against chronic diseases and keep the body healthy. Say hello to polyphenols. ""There’s specific research that consumption of [polyphenols] can improve life quality, life expectancy, health in the prevention of cognitive aging and specifically Alzheimer’s disease,"" says Samantha Dieras, a registered dietician and director of ambulatory nutrition service at Mount Sinai Hospital. What are polyphenols? 11 Foods and Drinks High in Polyphenols Blueberries 525 mg/100g Blackberries 248 mg/100 g Raspberries 225mg/100 Strawberries 225 mg/100g Cranberries 120-315 mg/100g Coffee 200mg/ 100ml Green Tea 115mg/100ml Hazelnuts 291- 875 mg/100 g Pecans 1520 mg/100g Walnuts 1558-1625 mg/100g Olive oil 50-1000 mg/kg* *Based on olive ripeness, extraction technique and storage Polyphenols are molecules with both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that are found in plants and plant-based foods. ""The plant foods make polyphenols to protect themselves from the environment,"" says Beth Goodridge, a registered dietitian with Kaiser Permanente in northern California. ""When we eat plants that have polyphenols, it provides us with some protection, too."" You may have heard of some polyphenols, such as flavonoids and resveratrol, but there are more than 8,000 of these small molecules grouped into categories based on their chemical structures. Why are polyphenols good for you? ""The primary superpower [of polyphenols] is they act as an antioxidant in the body,"" says Goodridge. Antioxidants are natural compounds that neutralize unstable molecules or free radicals and protect the body. ""Free radicals disrupt the natural flow, "" says Goodridge. ""They cause mischief in the body,"" An accumulation of free radicals in the body damages cells, known as oxidative stress. Antioxidants help slow down the oxidative process and slow down aging. Helps older adults Polyphenols have many health benefits, especially for older adults. A 2022 review of health benefits of polyphenols in spices, published in Current Research in Food Science, notes that oxidative stress —an imbalance of antioxidants and free radicals in the body — is a major cause of many chronic diseases and aging cells. The authors said that polyphenols can help minimize cell damage due to oxidative stress. 11 Foods and Drinks High in Polyphenols Blueberries 525 mg/100g Blackberries 248 mg/100 g Raspberries 225mg/100 Strawberries 225 mg/100g Cranberries 120-315 mg/100g Coffee 200mg/ 100ml Green Tea 115mg/100ml Hazelnuts 291- 875 mg/100 g Pecans 1520 mg/100g Walnuts 1558-1625 mg/100g Olive oil 50-1000 mg/kg* *Based on olive ripeness, extraction technique and storage Provides health benefits Polyphenols can help with brain function and cognition. A systematic review published in Frontiers in Nutrition found that eating polyphenols for moderate and long periods may improve both working and episodic memory in middle-aged and older adults. One review published in the journal Antioxidants in 2022 hypothesized that polyphenols such as curcumin might help protect the brain by preventing the accumulation of the beta-amyloid plaques that are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Improves gut health Many foods that contain polyphenols also have fiber, which is important for regular bowel movements. ""Polyphenols can help with digestion, and that can help us in the restroom,"" says Goodridge. According to a study published in the Journal of Food Biochemistry in 2022, the gut microbiome transformed polyphenols into bioactive compounds that could have ""therapeutic effects"" on gut health. Helps with heart disease Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with one person dying every 33 seconds. ""One of the challenging things with heart disease is the inside of our arteries over the years can get rigid [and] stiff,"" says Goodridge. Arteries need to be elastic, yet oxidative stress can cause them to become rigid. ""Polyphenols can be protective of heart health,"" Goodridge says. Prevents negative effects of cell death Polyphenols can reduce cellular senescence. Cellular senescence occurs when cells die and accumulate in the body instead of leaving. They can leak harmful compounds, lead to inflammation and contribute to other coronary diseases, says Dieras. ""The number of cells that are in that stage accumulates as you get older,"" she says. Polyphenol-rich foods Many fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs, spices and beverages, such as green tea and coffee, contain polyphenols. The quantities of polyphenols vary based on the food or beverage, freshness, processing, and even the variety. Eating a healthy and varied diet helps ensure you're eating sufficient polyphenols. ""You're probably getting these within your diet if you're eating a diverse diet with fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds,"" says Dieras. There are also polyphenols in olive oil, whole grains and legumes. Plus, you get the additional benefits of fiber and vitamins when you eat these foods, she says. Brightly-colored fruits and vegetables, especially red-colored, are high in polyphenols, says Goodridge. Foods high in polyphenols include cranberries, pomegranates, red grapes, and berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and vegetables, like tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and onions, she says. (See box.) Eat a rainbow of colors for adequate nutrition throughout the week, says Goodridge. ""All the different colors help the body in different ways,"" she says. ""Color is mother nature's way of saying, 'I'm really good for you, whether that's a different polyphenol or a vitamin.'"" Why freshness matters Fresh produce has a higher nutrient content than fruits and vegetables that have been sitting in the fruit bowl or crisper drawer for a while. The longer it takes to consume fruit or vegetables after harvest, there's a steady decline in the bioavailability of the nutrients, says Dieras. ""A lot of the nutrients, including the polyphenols, can oxidize and degrade over time,"" she adds. Have a lot of produce that you aren't going to eat quickly? Keep produce cool. ""Polyphenols are delicate,"" says Goodridge. Store produce in the fridge to preserve some of the polyphenols, she says. Fresh produce has higher polyphenols than canned produce. ""There's going to be a higher polyphenol content in foods that are fresh versus cans,"" says Goodridge. ""Freshness definitely matters."" How much do you need? There are guidelines for how quantities of macronutrients, such as protein, you should be consuming daily. So, you may wonder if polyphenols have similar recommendations. ""There is no guideline yet for the amount of polyphenols that adults should eat every day,"" Goodridge says. In lieu of such recommendations, track the number of servings of fruits, vegetables and whole grains you eat in a day. ""For example, you want to have at least a cup and a half of fruit a day and at least two and a half cups of vegetables or more,"" says Goodridge. Half of your consumption of grains, at minimum, should be whole grains, such as brown rice or wheat bread for your daily amount, she says. By doing this, you'll be including an adequate amount. of healthy polyphenols in your diet. Should you take supplements? People may reach for a supplement when they're concerned that they're not getting an adequate intake of a vitamin, mineral or, in this case, polyphenols. Nutritionists recommend the best way to get polyphenols is with food. When you eat foods with polyphenols, you're also getting important macronutrients, such as fiber and micronutrients, like vitamin C, says Goodridge. The body absorbs polyphenols better in food than when they are isolated in a supplement. ""The other components in a food help those polyphenols to be digested and absorbed appropriately,"" says Goodridge. ""You don’t get that when it’s just a supplement."" Be aware that medications can interact with polyphenol supplements. ""A significant part of the population above 50 is on multiple medications,"" says Dieras. ""I don't know specifically how the individual polyphenols will interact with their medications."" Before you seek out supplements, you should always speak to your medical provider about any risks or adverse effects that could occur. ""It's important to speak to your provider to figure out all the medications that you're on, how they interact with each other, and how [a polyphenol] supplement would interact with those,"" says Dieras. Lauren David is a contributing writer who writes about food, gardening and health. Her work has appeared in The Washington Post, HuffPost, Martha Stewart Living, Reader’s Digest and other outlets.","The article explores the benefits of polyphenols, a type of antioxidant found in plant-based foods, and their role in protecting against chronic diseases.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/seasonal-flu-vaccines/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by What You Need to Know About Getting the Flu Shot This Year The vaccine lowers risk of serious symptoms that disproportionately affect older adults By Rachel Nania, Updated October 04, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 03, 2024 / Updated October 04, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Shutterstock) Even though temperatures are still summerlike in many areas of the country, it’s time to start preparing for the coming cold and flu season. Health officials are predicting that the 2024-2025 respiratory illness season will be similar to last year’s, possibly even better. “That being said, there are a lot of assumptions that go into a projection,” Center﻿s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Mandy Cohen, M.D., said at an August press briefing. “If those assumptions prove wrong, say, for example, the number of people who ultimately get vaccinated against flu, COVID-19 and RSV is lower than expected, then that could mean more hospitalizations, not fewer.” Newly updated COVID-19 vaccines were recently approved and are making their way to pharmacies and clinics nationwide. Flu shots for the 2024-2025 are also starting to become available and are especially important for older adults who are at higher risk for getting seriously ill if infected. The CDC estimates that between 70 and 85 percent of flu-related deaths in the United States occur among adults 65 and older, and as many as 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations happen to people in this age group. “Influenza is a serious illness, and people need to be thinking of it as such,” says Mark Rupp, M.D., a professor and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. But often people don’t think of flu as being as serious as some other diseases, says Kathleen Linder, M.D. a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases at Michigan Medicine. “I think part of the challenge is that people use the word ‘flu’ to mean a lot of different illnesses,” Linder says. “You hear people talk about the stomach flu, which isn't influenza at all. And I think it's just important to remember that influenza proper can be very, very dangerous. Some of the sickest patients that we see in our ICU are people who have influenza.” Research shows the flu vaccine can lower your risk of hospitalization and death from influenza. Rupp says that on an average year, “there's somewhere around 25,000 deaths in the United States due to influenza that can be very much diminished at risk by getting an influenza vaccine.” Here’s what you need to know about getting the shot this year. 1. The vaccine targets three influenza viruses Similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, the composition of the flu vaccine is updated each year to target stains of the influenza virus that health officials expect will be circulating. This year’s flu shot will be trivalent, meaning it will protect against three different influenza viruses, including H1N1, H3N2 and a B/Victoria lineage virus. The vaccine was found to reduce the risk of hospitalization from flu in high-risk individuals by 35 percent during the southern hemisphere’s 2024 flu season, which typically runs April through September, a new report from the CDC shows. The researchers note that the vaccine’s effectiveness could be similar in the northern hemisphere if similar flu strains circulate during its flu season (October through May). 2. Older adults need a high-dose version There are different flu vaccine options available, and for people under 65, health officials don’t recommend any licensed vaccine over another. However, adults 65-plus should choose one of the higher-dose vaccines available, the CDC says. The high-dose shots are: Fluzone high-dose vaccineFlublok recombinant flu vaccineFluad adjuvanted flu vaccine “The issue is that as people get older, their immunologic response is not as robust as younger, healthier people,” Rupp says. ﻿ ﻿In order to account for this, he says, you can either get a flu vaccine with a higher antigen level —﻿ a marker that tells the body's immune system that something is harmful ﻿— or that includes an ingredient called adjuvant, which stimulates the immune system to create a stronger immune response. “Both of them are ways in which you can get older people to have an appropriate amount of protection,” Rupp says. These higher-dose shots may result in more of the temporary, mild side effects that you’d expect from a standard-dose flu vaccine, the CDC says. Common side effects from the flu shot can include: Pain, redness or swelling at the injection siteHeadacheFeverNauseaMuscle acheFatigue Vaccine side effects typically disappear after a few days and are normal signs that the body is building protection. 3. It’s best to be vaccinated by the end of October The best time to get the flu vaccine is in September or October, the CDC says. If you get it too early, say in July or August, you “might run out of immunity by the end of the season,” Linder says. Flu season in the United States typically stretches from October to February, though activity can last as late as May, according to the CDC. It takes about two weeks after you are vaccinated for immunity to fully set in. 4. You can get your flu shot with COVID-19 and RSV vaccines Like last year, the advice from experts this fall is that the flu and COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same appointment, so there’s no need to make two separate trips to the pharmacy or doctor’s office. You can also get your flu shot with an RSV vaccine, which is recommended just one time for everyone 75 and older and people 60 to 74 with certain health conditions. If you’re due for all three vaccines, it’s fine to get them all at once, the CDC says. You can find flu, COVID-19 and RSV shots near you at vaccines.gov.

Plus, could ice cream help? By Michael Schroeder, Updated November 19, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published May 12, 2023 / Updated November 19, 2024 Getty Images Nearly 1 in 6 adults, or 15.8 percent, have diabetes, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That amounts to about 40 million Americans who have the chronic disease, when combined with the latest Census data. The rate increases with age, rising to 17.7 percent for those 40 to 59, then to more than 1 in 4, or 27.3 percent, for adults age 60 and older, the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics report found in evaluating prevalence between August 2021 and August 2023. Many more have, about 1 in 3, or 98 million, Americans have prediabetes, where blood sugar has risen above healthy levels but isn’t high enough yet to be classified as diabetes. Naturally, then, it might feel daunting to try to get high blood sugar under control. But fortunately experts say a number of simple (read: straightforward, not necessarily all easy, but doable) steps can bring glucose levels back into a healthy range. You also have plenty of reasons beyond diabetes prevention to do just that. People with prediabetes have a higher risk of suffering from a heart attack or stroke in the future — along with other heart disease issues — “even without full-blown diabetes,” says Zhenqi Liu, M.D., James M. Moss professor of diabetes at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. ﻿ For those with the chronic disease, as the CDC notes in its November report updating prevalence figures: “Uncontrolled blood glucose levels over a long period of time can affect multiple organ systems, including the nervous system, kidneys, eyes, heart, and blood vessels.” All that to say, getting it under control now can be a lifesaver and improve your quality of life as well. Here are steps you can take to reduce your risk and lower your blood sugar. VIDEO: Daily Habits That Could Raise Your Diabetes Risk Here are steps you can take to reduce your risk and lower your blood sugar. 1. Know your numbers To start, you need to know where you stand. The vast majority with prediabetes — more than 80 percent — don’t know they have it, according to the CDC. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends people ages 35 to 70 who are overweight or obese get screened for prediabetes and diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening for all people 45 and up and testing blood sugar earlier in those at higher risk for diabetes. You can assess your individual risk using an online tool provided by the ADA, answering questions about risk factors ranging from age and immediate family history of diabetes to activity level and race. What’s considered a healthy blood sugar number depends on the test. For example, with a fasting blood sugar test, anything below 100 milligrams per deciliter is considered healthy. A glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes and 126 mg﻿/dL or higher is diabetes. Another test, hemoglobin A1C, measures a person’s average blood sugar over two to three months as a percentage. A result of 5.7 to 6.4 percent is considered prediabetes and 6.5 percent or higher is diabetes. For more about testing, see Your Prediabetes Questions Answered. 2. Consider using a glucose monitor Many with diabetes who rely on insulin to help with blood sugar control use continuous glucose monitors — wearable devices that provide ongoing data on blood sugar — to track their levels. While some people who don’t have diabetes use the technology as well to keep tabs on their blood sugar, there is currently no strong data on the effectiveness of this strategy for people with prediabetes﻿﻿. Continuous glucose monitors help with better understanding the immediate impact of lifestyle on glucose levels, explains Megan Kristan, M.D., endocrinologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, “Seeing how different food choices, different activity levels impact your blood sugar,” she notes, “so then you can use that information to make a different choice the next time."" If you’ve been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, talk to your doctor about how to best monitor your blood sugar as you make lifestyle changes. VIDEO: Daily Habits That Could Raise Your Diabetes Risk 3. Don’t complicate exercise Lifestyle changes needn’t be overly involved or difficult to be effective — like with incorporating regular physical activity. “You have to exercise 150 minutes a week,” says Elbert Huang, M.D., general internist and director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago. That needs to be at least a brisk walk, he notes, but it doesn’t have to be more strenuous than that. Experts say the key is to pick a routine you’re likely to stick with, rather than one with onerous requirements you’re not likely to follow. It could be any form of exercise, said Minna Woo, M.D., a clinician scientist and endocrinologist at Toronto General Hospital, and director of the Banting and Best Diabetes Centre. You don’t need a gym membership, she adds To optimize the benefits, consider taking that walk after you eat. Research suggests exercising 30 minutes after a meal may be optimal to help with blood glucose control.﻿ Just don’t stop at cardio, since building muscle can also help with glucose control. Research published last year in Diabetologia suggests combing strength training with cardio is more effective for controlling blood sugar than aerobic exercise alone. “In general, you need muscle to fight off insulin resistance,” says Jennifer Hwang, internist and instructor of medicine at the University of Chicago. Aim to do weight-bearing exercise twice a week, she advises, in line with public health recommendations.﻿ As noted by the CDC, you should try to work all major muscle groups, including legs, hips, back, abdomen or core, chest, shoulders and arms. Getty Images Supplements for diabetes prevention It might be tempting to try supplements, such as vitamin D, omega-3s and berberine, in hopes of lowering blood glucose. But despite a few promising studies, there isn’t yet proof that taking supplements will help prevent diabetes in someone with prediabetes. If you are considering taking a supplement, Amy Hess-Fischl, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator at the University of Chicago Medical Center, advises talking with your doctor first to make sure that it doesn’t interact with other medications, like those taken for high blood pressure or cholesterol. What is the glycemic index? Chances are, if you’re paying closer attention to which foods spike your blood sugar, you’ve heard of the glycemic index. This is used to rate foods containing carbohydrates by how quickly they can cause blood sugar to rise. The scale starts at zero and goes up to 100 for pure sugar. The glycemic index was designed as a research tool. But while it allows for easy categorization, Hess-Fischl notes that the same food doesn’t affect everyone’s glucose level in the same way. How foods are prepared or if they’ve been combined with other foods can also affect blood sugar. So if you’re meal planning, try to avoid separating foods, like sweet potatoes and white potatoes, into “good” and “bad” categories, respectively.﻿ “White potatoes can be healthful if they eat them with the skins,” Hess-Fischl says, adding that their glycemic index is not too dissimilar from that of sweet potatoes (see below). Taking it all with a grain of salt — or, say, a sugar molecule — here’s where some foods fall on the glycemic index: Low (55 or less) Oatmeal Apples, oranges and grapes Carrots and other non-starchy veggies Quinoa Most nuts and beans Skim milk White potato, boiled (54) Medium (56 to 69) Cherries, cantaloupe and raisins Sweet potato, boiled (61) Pumpkin Macaroni and cheese Bagel Couscous Honey High (70 and higher) Watermelon White potato, mashed (8﻿3) Rutabaga Cheerio﻿s, corn flakes and many other cereals White bread Gluten-free bread Rice cakes 4. Get professional help Doctors and dietitians who regularly work with patients who have diabetes can help a person with prediabetes create a road map for getting blood sugar back in a healthy range. Sudipa Sarkar, an endocrinologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, recommends talking with your doctor to see if you’re eligible for the research-backed National Diabetes Prevention Program, a public-private partnership that’s been shown to help prevent the progression to diabetes. ﻿5. Cut back not just on sugar but on all ultra﻿processed foods Obvious blood sugar spikers like cookies and cake should be consumed in moderation. But you’ll also want to be circumspect about other foods that can cause glucose levels to rise quickly. In particular, go easy on all those processed carbs. “When people talk about diabetes and sugar, most people think it’s the sweets they need to avoid, and that’s of course true. But really what’s more common is the starchy carbohydrates,” Woo says. That includes things like bread, pasta, noodles and white rice. “These are the most deadly culprits that will raise their sugar levels,” she says. ﻿6﻿. Get with the guidelines for a balanced diet A balanced diet that cuts carbs could help with weight loss — which itself is protective against diabetes — and quickly bring blood sugar back into a healthy range, according to findings published in JAMA Network Open. Aim for an eating pattern that’s similar to the Mediterranean diet with a well-balanced plate: Getty Images Supplements for diabetes prevention It might be tempting to try supplements, such as vitamin D, omega-3s and berberine, in hopes of lowering blood glucose.

Fill half your plate with veggies Kristan, recommends a plate loaded up with vegetable﻿s. You can’t go wrong with dark leafy greens like spinach as well as pulses, such as chickpeas and beans, which have all been linked to lower blood sugar levels﻿.﻿ Short of going vegan or vegetarian, you may still reduce your risk of developing diabetes by following a healthy, plant-based diet, according to recent research published in Diabetes Care. The study followed 11,965 adults aged 45 to 64 over two decades. It found that those who ate a healthy diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, tea and coffee, while minimizing less healthy plant foods like refined grains and fruit juices along with animal-based proteins, had a lower risk of developing diabetes. However, eating an unhealthy plant-based diet with more refined and sweetened foods wasn’t linked to a lower risk of developing diabetes. ﻿8. Fill a fourth of your plate with healthy carbs This macronutrient, like the others — protein and fat — has a place in a healthy diet. But carbs shouldn’t cover half your plate — which is typical with the Western diet, Kristan emphasizes.﻿ Experts add that it’s important to swap in healthy carbs. Try to have more foods like quinoa or farro, lentils and chickpeas, and brown rice and fewer processed carbs. Instead of villainizing foods, understand where they fit on your plate. Starchy favorites like corn or potatoes will raise your blood sugar and go in the carbs category, rather than that half of your plate that’s devoted to veggies, Kristan says 9. Pump up the fiber The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people with diabetes and those at risk for it eat at least 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories (or 28 grams for a 2,000-calorie diet), following the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for everyone. AARP’s Whole Body Reset, based on the latest research in people age 50 and over, recommends 20 to 25 grams a day for women and 30 grams for men. Vegetables like lentils, nuts and fruits, especially those with edible skin, such as apples and pears, and edible seeds including berries are good sources of fiber, according to the ADA. ﻿1﻿0. Sleep on it Tired of the daily grind? Take it lying down. “Adequate sleep is critical not only for diabetes management but in terms of all metabolic diseases including weight management,” Kristan says. Conversely, not getting at least seven hours of shut-eye nightly is associated with insulin resistance, according to a review of research. When that happens, the cells don’t respond to that hormone like they should — to efficiently take in sugar from the blood and convert it to energy — and blood glucose rises. Plus, being sleep-deprived can make it harder to handle stress, which also contributes to the stew of toxic hormones like cortisol linked to insulin resistance. Think about being overtired and overstressed. “Those two are so interrelated,” Kristan says. She adds that when more insulin is produced, in response, that increases hunger and you eat more calories. Here are some tips to put the spiral to bed. ﻿1﻿1. Lifestyle changes alone not enough? Consider medication For certain patients, medication like metformin may also be helpful to lower blood sugar. “Some people are going to have a really difficult time making lifestyle changes, and some people will tell you I’m more likely to take my medicines every single day to control the prediabetes,” Huang says. While lifestyle changes are part of a comprehensive approach, experts say what’s most important is doing whatever it takes — and not waiting — to lower blood sugar so you can live a longer, healthier life. Getty Images Can eating ice cream prevent diabetes? In a delicious odyssey, an Atlantic article recently dealt with a swirling controversy around an “inconvenient” finding replicated in various nutrition studies: Consuming not only dairy, but ice cream in particular, has been linked with a lower risk of diabetes. As detailed in ""Nutrition Science’s Most Preposterous Result,” not only individual studies but analysis of decades of research has failed to dispense with this clearly consumer-approved but scientifically improbable association. A 2016 paper published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition summarizing data from about a dozen studies found that tucking into at least half a cup of the dairy dessert per week was associated with a 19 percent decrease in diabetes risk (even higher than the 14 percent risk reduction seen with yogurt). But, as noted in the story, the authors of that paper, like other experts, wrote off the findings to what’s called “reverse causation” — in essence that the link between ice cream and diabetes wasn’t going in the direction you’d think. That is to say, for instance, people who are healthy and already at lower risk for developing diabetes might have felt more at ease having rocky road, while those who were already at higher risk for developing the chronic disease might have had less. The key takeaway in all of this, buried about 3,300 words into the sweetly self-indulgent exposé, is sadly vanilla: “To be clear, none of the experts interviewed for this article is inclined to believe that the ice-cream effect is real.” Mark Pereira, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, has long wrestled with the ice cream–diabetes risk reduction correlation in his own research. “I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything like this finding in my career because it’s completely unexpected,” he told AARP. “The Atlantic article was really good journalism,” added Pereira, who was interviewed for that story. But even lacking an explanation for the link, Pereira isn’t about to advise people to make soft serve a feature of their daily diet in the name of diabetes prevention. “There could be something there that’s causal,” Pereira acknowledges, giving at least a glimmer of hope to gelato apologists the world over. “But that’s a far cry from saying, ‘Oh, I would recommend that people with prediabetes increase their ice cream intake.’ I mean there’s so many other ways that you could change your diet and improve your physical activity to reduce your A1C [a measure of blood sugar] and prevent diabetes.” Scooped another way: There’s still no proven reason to expect ice cream will protect you from diabetes. So, for now at least, experts still suggest savoring ice cream in moderation — and not for prevention. Getty Images Can eating ice cream prevent diabetes?

That is to say, for instance, people who are healthy and already at lower risk for developing diabetes might have felt more at ease having rocky road, while those who were already at higher risk for developing the chronic disease might have had less. The key takeaway in all of this, buried about 3,300 words into the sweetly self-indulgent exposé, is sadly vanilla: “To be clear, none of the experts interviewed for this article is inclined to believe that the ice-cream effect is real.” Mark Pereira, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, has long wrestled with the ice cream–diabetes risk reduction correlation in his own research. “I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything like this finding in my career because it’s completely unexpected,” he told AARP. “The Atlantic article was really good journalism,” added Pereira, who was interviewed for that story. But even lacking an explanation for the link, Pereira isn’t about to advise people to make soft serve a feature of their daily diet in the name of diabetes prevention. “There could be something there that’s causal,” Pereira acknowledges, giving at least a glimmer of hope to gelato apologists the world over. “But that’s a far cry from saying, ‘Oh, I would recommend that people with prediabetes increase their ice cream intake.’ I mean there’s so many other ways that you could change your diet and improve your physical activity to reduce your A1C [a measure of blood sugar] and prevent diabetes.” Scooped another way: There’s still no proven reason to expect ice cream will protect you from diabetes. So, for now at least, experts still suggest savoring ice cream in moderation — and not for prevention.

His stories have been published in a range of print and digital publications, including Time, U.S. News & World Report, The Washington Post, and Psychology Today.","The article explores ways to lower blood sugar levels and prevent type 2 diabetes, a condition affecting nearly 1 in 6 adults in the US.

A surprising insight is that while some studies have linked ice cream consumption to a lower risk of diabetes, experts attribute this to ""reverse causation"" and do not recommend ice cream as a preventive measure.",236

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/common-cruise-ship-illnesses/,"5 Illnesses You Can Get on a Cruise Ship (Besides COVID) Plus, tips on how to avoid getting sick while at sea and ports of call By Rachel Nania and Nicole Gill Council, AARP En español Published March 17, 2023 Concerns over the spread of COVID-19 have loomed over the travel industry for the last three years, but with the public health emergency coming to an end and a robust menu of preventive tools and treatments available, many of those fears are fading. A new AARP survey shows 81 percent of adults 50-plus who plan to travel in 2023 believe it’s safe to do so now, up from 77 percent in 2021. And while interest in cruising is down slightly among the 50-plus population this year compared to last, a recent AAA survey finds that, overall, the share of travelers considering a cruise vacation in 2023 is up. However, the return to the skies and seas does not mean COVID-19 is no longer a threat. “Indoor densely populated places where we’re exchanging exhaled breath with one another is still going to be a concern for me,” says Wilbur Chen, M.D., adult infectious disease physician and director of the University of Maryland﻿, Baltimore Travel Medicine Practice. That concern isn’t limited to COVID, either. Flu spreads in a similar way, Chen points out. It’s important to note, though, that since the start of the pandemic, many cruise lines have invested in better air circulation systems with medical﻿-grade HEPA filters, says travel expert Pamela Kwiatkowski, cofounder and chief insurance officer at Goose Insurance Services in Vancouver, British Columbia. “I think that’s the first step they’ve taken in terms of improving the air filtration system, which removes almost all of the airborne pathogens,” she says. Still, plenty of bugs can lurk on busy boats. Read on to discover some common illnesses you can pick up on a cruise — and what you can do to help keep yourself healthy on your next getaway. ﻿ 1. Flu and other respiratory illnesses Flu season spiked early this year in the U.S., along with another respiratory illness that can be particularly dangerous for older adults, respiratory syncytial virus, which is known as RSV. Cases of flu and RSV have declined from fall’s peak, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows, but the viruses that cause these two illnesses are still circulating in the U.S. and other parts of the globe. “Influenza is complicated during cruise travel because﻿, of course﻿, people on a cruise ship — both the passengers and the crew — may come from different parts of the world, which means that the rates of influenza for your particular country may not necessarily be the same as in other places,” says Jose Lucar, M.D., an infectious disease physician and associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. According to the CDC, flu season in the southern hemisphere, which includes Australia and parts of South America and Africa, typically runs April through September. In the tropics, flu flares up throughout the year. Staying healthy: If you haven’t rolled up your sleeve for the flu shot yet, make sure you get it at least two weeks before going on a cruise, Lucar says. The same applies to the latest COVID booster. When it comes to RSV, there isn’t a vaccine yet, but the FDA could approve one soon. A few other tips: If you’re at high risk for flu complications, talk to your doctor about antiviral treatment and prevention before your trip, the CDC recommends. Don’t forget about high-quality face masks, which can help to tamp down the spread of respiratory illnesses. And be sure to make — and pack — a list of all the medications you take, in case you wind up needing medical care on board. “That just makes it easier for everyone, so that if there is an emergency, if you’re not able to talk really well, you can at least hand the sheet over and it’s done,” Chen says. 2. Norovirus This is one of the most well-known bugs that can foil fun on a ship. Norovirus — marked by diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain — is to blame for more than 90 percent of diarrheal disease outbreaks on cruises, according to the CDC. That said, norovirus outbreaks on ships account for only 1 percent of all such reported cases. “This infection is very contagious,” Lucar says. The virus is also a “hearty” one, Chen points out. It can survive for long periods of time on surfaces and is resistant to common disinfectants. Close living quarters, shared bathrooms, populated pools, busy buffet lines and rapid turnover of passengers make it difficult to control the spread of the virus once it hits a ship. “It’s just really the perfect scenario for transmission of highly contagious GI [gastrointestinal] pathogens,” Lucar says. According to the Cruise Lines International Association, the risk each year of getting laboratory-confirmed norovirus during a ship outbreak is about 1 in 5,500. The association, which says it is the largest cruise industry trade association in the world, noted on its website that crew members use strict sanitation and cleaning practices created with the CDC’s Vessel Sanitation Program. Cabins are cleaned once a day﻿, and other common areas, such as elevators and pools, are cleaned multiple times a day. In late February, more than 300 people aboard a Princess Cruise﻿s ship fell ill with diarrhea and vomiting, according to the CDC, though the agency didn’t cite the cause of the illness that sickened the 284 passengers and 34 crew. The Ruby Princess increased disinfection and cleaning procedures in the wake of the outbreak. Other bugs that have popped up on boats include salmonella and E. coli. One to keep an eye on is shigella, which the CDC notes has been behind GI outbreaks on cruise ships. This bacterium causes an infection known as shigellosis, which can cause fever, stomach pain and diarrhea that can be bloody or prolonged. Typically, the infection is treated with antibiotics, Chen says, but the CDC recently issued a warning that antibiotic﻿-resistant strains are circulating in the U.S. Chen isn’t aware of any outbreaks of the resistant varieties on cruise ships, but it’s something to monitor. Staying healthy: To avoid getting a GI bug, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water before eating and after going to the bathroom and coming into contact with high-touch surfaces, like doorknobs and stair railings. Hand sanitizers don’t work well against norovirus, Lucar notes. Travel expert Kwiatkowski also recommends drinking plenty of water to keep your body running at its best. However, she advises passengers stay away from the water at ports, particularly if a passenger is vulnerable to gastrointestinal illnesses. “Handwashing, cleaning your stateroom, watching what you eat and how much you eat, and making sure that you stay hydrated will go a long way in preventing these illnesses, from you catching them even if they are there,” she says. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist about any medications you should pack, such as loperamide (Imodium) to help treat diarrhea or dimenhydrinate (Dramamine, Gravol) for nausea. If your immune system is compromised, your doctor may want to prescribe something ahead of your trip. 3. Measles Although less common than respiratory and GI illnesses, measles, along with chicken pox and other vaccine-preventable diseases, can circulate on cruise ships. Measles, a highly contagious virus that can linger in the air even hours after an infected person leaves the room, was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, thanks to a successful vaccine program. But cases still pop up in the ﻿States, and the virus is common in many countries around the world. If an unvaccinated or under﻿-vaccinated passenger or crew member contracts the virus and brings it on board, other vulnerable people can get sick, Chen explains. (A ship was quarantined off the coast of St. Lucia in 2019 when measles was reported on board.) The same goes for chicken pox (varicella), which is similarly caused by a highly contagious virus that can circulate among unvaccinated people. Staying healthy: To avoid these and other vaccine-preventable diseases, make sure you’re up to date on your routine vaccines before traveling. Two doses of the chicken pox vaccine are more than 90 percent effective at preventing the disease, and two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles. 4. Seasickness Is the motion of the ocean getting to you? Seasickness, while not contagious or related to an infection, can make you feel downright miserable. The good news: Most people recover quickly from seasickness, formally known as motion sickness, and there are medication﻿s that can help. Motion sickness — which can cause dizziness, nausea and vomiting whether you’re on a boat, in a car or on a roller coaster — occurs when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses. Interestingly, adults 50 and older are less susceptible than younger adults and children, the CDC notes. Staying healthy: If you’re prone to going a little green when you travel, talk to your doctor ahead of your trip about medications that can help with symptoms. Prescription and over-the-counter ﻿antihistamines — like dimenhydrinate ﻿(﻿Dramamine), for example — are most frequently used to treat motion sickness. ﻿ However, antihistamines can interact with other medications and often cause drowsiness and decreased mental alertness, and the non﻿sedating ones appear to be less effective, the CDC says. Your doctor may also prescribe or recommend a patch that can help prevent nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness. Another tip: Have your physician review your current list of medications, since common pills — including some antidepressants and painkillers — can make seasickness worse, according to the CDC. ﻿ A few other things that can help with seasickness: Try lying down on your stomach, shutting your eyes or looking off into the horizon.Avoid the upper levels of the boat﻿.Stay hydrated and limit alcohol and caffeine﻿ consumption.Avoid smoking﻿. Even short-term cessation reduces your susceptibility to motion sickness, the CDC says﻿.Distract yourself with music, controlled breathing or aromatherapy (try mint or lavender). Sucking on a flavored lozenge (some experts recommend a hard ginger candy) may also help, the CDC says.While the CDC says the scientific data on acupressure for seasickness is lacking, it works for some. You can find wrist bands for motion sickness in many drugstores. 5. Burns and bites A word of advice from Lucar and Chen: Don’t forget the SPF when packing for your cruise. A burn on vacation can ruin your fun in the sun and put you at higher risk for skin cancer. “Also, if you’re going to places that have a lot of insects and mosquitoes, make sure you wear your insect repellent so that you don’t get a bunch of bites, because we also are worried about malaria, dengue, chikungunya, ﻿Zika — those sorts of things — at ports of call,” Chen says. Staying healthy: Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, the CDC recommends, and be sure your bottle says “blocks UVA and UVB” or “broad spectrum” on the label. When it comes to insect repellent, look for a spray that’s registered with the Environmental Protection Agency. Layering it with sunscreen? Put the repellent on second, over the sunscreen, the CDC advises. To ease any health-related concerns you might have before booking a cruise, Kwiatkowski suggests using a travel agent who is a cruise line expert or contacting the cruise line to ask about their cleaning protocols and track record. “I know it sounds like a lot of work,” she says, “but travel is a big investment, and you really want to travel worry﻿-free.”﻿﻿ Rachel Nania writes about health care and health policy for AARP.

""You can't really get on a path to wellness without addressing all four of these,” says cardiologist Dara Lee Lewis, M.D., codirector of the Women's Program at the Lown Cardiovascular Group in Boston. But recent research suggests some unexpected ways to further protect your heart's health. Try these tactics also to lower your risk for both heart attacks and strokes: Your Heart Healthy Grocery List Understanding Angina Statins Myths When You Need a Stent Habits That Lower Blood Pressure Heart Failure Breakthroughs Women and Heart Disease Take a hot bath daily There's nothing wrong with having a nice long soak in the tub while winter weather and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have you spending more time at home. In fact, doing so may give you an extra heart boost. High temperatures cause the blood vessels to dilate, which lowers blood pressure. Plus a hot bath helps with lowering stress, one of the four pillars of heart health. A new study in the journal Heart confirms these benefits. Researchers tracked the bathing habits and health records of some 30,000 people ages 40 to 59 in Japan for more than 20 years. Compared with people who took baths less than twice a week, those who soaked in a tub almost every day had a 28 percent lower risk of heart problems overall and a 26 percent lower risk of stroke. The findings held up even when researchers took into account other factors that can affect heart health, such as exercise, a smoking habit and diet. Just stretch It doesn't replace a vigorous bike ride or brisk walk, but according to a recent study from Europe, mere stretching may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by improving blood flow, which in turn is believed to decrease stiffness and damage to the walls of your arteries. To test the idea, researchers at the University of Milan divided 39 men and women into three groups. One group did leg, ankle and foot stretches five times a week for 40 minutes, while another group stretched just one side of the body. The third group didn't stretch at all. When the study ended 12 weeks later, those in the stretching groups had significantly improved the health of their blood vessels compared to those who didn't stretch. Your Heart Healthy Grocery List Understanding Angina Statins Myths When You Need a Stent Habits That Lower Blood Pressure Heart Failure Breakthroughs Women and Heart Disease Stretching doesn't quite meet the American Heart Association's recommendation of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week (30 minutes, 5 times a week). But it could “have a practical implication in maintaining or even improving vascular function in people with a limited aerobic capacity or with a limited motor capacity,” says study author, Emiliano Cè, associate professor of biomedical science for health at the University of Milan. Filter your coffee Improving heart health is one of coffee's nifty perks — but it turns out that's true only if you brew it the right way. A study of more than a half million people in Norway recently showed that those who drank filtered coffee were 15 percent less likely to die during the 20-year follow-up due to any cause, including heart disease. People who drank one to four cups a day of filtered coffee had the lowest risk of death from heart woes. The findings held even after researchers accounted for participants’ weight, blood pressure and cholesterol — factors that could skew the results. Norwegians who regularly drank unfiltered joe (that includes espresso drinks or brews from methods like a French press or moka pot) had a higher risk of dying from heart disease. Why the difference? The study authors believe unfiltered coffee retains high levels of oils in coffee that can raise cholesterol levels. Practice tai chi The heart-related benefits of tai chi, the ancient Chinese practice of slow, meditative movement, are multifold. According to a study of more than 200 people with somewhat elevated blood pressure, those who practiced tai chi for three months significantly decreased it, compared to those who didn't. In research involving obese patients with diabetes, tai chi lowered cholesterol, body mass index (BMI) — a measure of weight and height used to define obesity — and C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation in the body that's linked to poorer heart health. These effects may be due to tai chi's effect on harmful stress, something a recent review study from the University of Arizona saw among older adults with cardiovascular disease in particular. However, tai chi is just one way to find calm and boost your heart's health. “It's not necessarily sitting in the lotus position, with your legs crossed, chanting,” Lewis says. “It can be baking bread, walking in nature, gardening, knitting — anything that takes you into the quiet part of your brain and allows you to shut the world out for a little bit.” Beth Howard is a North Carolina–based health and lifestyle writer. She has written for dozens of publications, including U.S. News & World Report, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Prevention, Better Homes & Gardens and Reader’s Digest.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

A novel insight is that the method of coffee brewing matters, with filtered coffee being associated with a lower risk of heart disease, while unfiltered coffee may raise cholesterol levels.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/ways-walking-improves-your-brain/,"5 Ways Walking Can Boost Your Brain Health Research suggests you should lace up your shoes and hit the road By Martha Murphy, AARP Comments En español Published June 02, 2023 Andre Rucker In early 2020, COVID-19 brought an end to my workouts at the gym. I was self-employed and recently widowed, and my new normal felt like solitary confinement. Then, one morning, I made a break for it and went for a walk. I did it again the next day, then the next. Soon my new daily habit began to make me feel happier and my mind sharper, both of which I could only credit to my daily treks. Curious about what was occurring, I did some research. It turns out there’s a mountain of scientific evidence that indicates walking — especially walking outdoors — is powerful medicine for your brain. Here’s what the data shows. 1. Walking may help you grow new brain cells. Moderately paced walks stimulate the release of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, that is key to the survival of existing brain neurons and the generation of new ones. “Perhaps the most exciting finding is that aerobic forms of exercise [including walking] likely help facilitate the growth of new neurons,” says Patrick Smith, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 2. Walking may boost your creativity. Walking increases the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the brain, which can open the gates to enhanced creativity. The brain uses “about three times as much oxygen for healthy neuron function as muscles do” and is extremely sensitive to decreases in oxygen levels, according to Advanced Neurotherapy, a neurofeedback wellness clinic in Needham, Massachusetts. Creativity is a cognitive skill that is part of problem-solving. Studies show that the simple act of getting up from your desk and taking a short walk can help trigger ideas. A Stanford University study found “creative output increased 60 percent when participants were walking,” even on a treadmill facing a blank wall. 3. Walking may enhance your mood. When you walk, increased blood flow to the brain initiates a “cascade of changes,” says Marie Pasinski, M.D., assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. “A cocktail of feel-good neurotransmitters — serotonin, dopamine, endorphins — is released.” Forty-two percent of American adults suffer a vitamin D deficiency. Our bodies manufacture vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, furthering the production of serotonin, a hormone benefiting memory and mood. Even on a cloudy day, “exposure to light elevates the mood,” says John Ratey, M.D., associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. 4. Walking may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Participants who walked more than 4,000 steps per day had healthier brain tissue in the area responsible for memory, learning and cognitive function than those who did not, one study found. That brain region, called the hippocampus, typically begins to shrink in late adulthood, leading not only to impaired memory but also an increased risk of dementia. The research revealed that aerobic exercise increases the size of the hippocampus. 5. Walking may decrease brain-damaging stress. Repeated exposure to stressful situations impairs memory, ­attention and cognitive flexibility. Walking in nature has been shown to be particularly effective at reducing stress levels. The impact of being outdoors may have to do with “optic flow” — the perception that objects are moving past us as we walk, which ­quiets the circuits responsible for stress, says Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist in the Department of Neurobiology at Stanford Medicine. “Self-generated optic flow — by walking, running or cycling — shifts the brain into a state of relaxation that’s not seen when you’re stationary,” he says. Scientists have seen walking reduce levels of cortisol, which surges during fight-or-flight situations. Elevated cortisol levels may damage cognition and contribute to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a 2019 ­review of studies in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience. Just a 20-minute walk has been shown to reduce stress. Martha W. Murphy is an award-winning writer. Her books and articles cover a range of topics, including health, food, business, marketing and memoir.","The article explores the benefits of walking for brain health, highlighting the scientific evidence that supports its positive impact on cognitive function and mental well-being.

A novel insight is that walking outdoors, with its associated ""optic flow,"" may be particularly effective at reducing stress levels by quieting the brain's stress circuits. Regular walking, even as little as 4,000 steps per day, is recommended for overall brain health.",240
https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/dietary-supplement-side-effects/#comments_widget_id,"Dietary Supplements and Side Effects Natural doesn’t always mean safe, so check with your doctor before popping a pill BSIP / Getty Images By Rachel Nania, AARP En español Published June 16, 2022 It’s common knowledge that prescription drugs can cause side effects — TV ads don’t let you forget that. And plenty of people know that taking over-the-counter medication can lead to unwanted symptoms (think of how some antihistamines can make you sleepy). When it comes to dietary supplements, however, many consumers are unaware that their vial of vitamins or bottle of herbs and other botanicals (think echinacea and ginkgo biloba) could come with risks. And a big reason boils down to how they’re sold — “as openly and as freely as food,” says Pieter Cohen, M.D., an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplement safety. “So just like you can buy some broccoli or a can of tomato sauce, you can just buy whatever sort of supplements or botanicals or probiotics you want in the store,” he says. And this helps to create a ""false impression"" that the powders, pills and capsules can’t cause harm. But a 2015 study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that about 23,000 people wind up in the emergency room each year due to adverse events caused by dietary supplements. Reactions the researchers identified ranged from chest pain and heart palpitations to dizziness and vomiting, and adults 65 and older were more likely to be hospitalized because of them. Rashes, shortness of breath, diarrhea, severe joint or muscle pain, slurred speech and blood in the urine are other possible adverse events that can result from supplement use, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These symptoms can vary from less serious to life-threatening. Did You Know? Fresh fruits and veggies are packed with vitamins and minerals, but manufacturers also add them to everyday foods, like breakfast cereals and beverages. So you may be getting more nutrients than you think through your diet, and taking more than you need raises the risk of side effects. Source: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements How supplements can cause side effects How can a vitamin or plant product cause adverse reactions typically associated with powerful drugs? Reasons run the gamut, experts say. Did You Know? Fresh fruits and veggies are packed with vitamins and minerals, but manufacturers also add them to everyday foods, like breakfast cereals and beverages. So you may be getting more nutrients than you think through your diet, and taking more than you need raises the risk of side effects. Source: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements Supplements, which are not held to the same federal approval standards as over-the-counter and prescription drugs, despite their widespread use, contain active ingredients that can have strong effects on the body, the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements explains. And in some products, these ingredients can be particularly potent. Cohen points to red yeast rice as an example — it’s a traditional Chinese culinary and medicinal product that’s “been used for hundreds of years to treat a variety of problems.” In the U.S., supplements containing red yeast rice are often marketed as effective at lowering cholesterol, and that’s because some red yeast rice products contain a substance produced by the yeast that is “chemically identical to the active ingredient in the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin,” the NIH’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health says. Some supplements contain no or low levels of this substance (known as monacolin K), but others are formulated “more like a prescription drug,” Cohen says. In turn, they can cause the same types of side effects and drug interactions as lovastatin, like muscle pain and weakness and liver toxicity, according to the NIH. And often consumers have no way of knowing how much of this prescription-like substance is present in a supplement. Supplements can also interact with other drugs in dangerous ways. Vitamin K can hamper the effectiveness of blood thinners, while vitamin E can augment their power, increasing the risk of bleeding. And Saint-John’s-wort can weaken the effects of some heart medications, antidepressants and statins. Older adults need to be especially careful when it comes to possible interactions such as these, Cohen warns, since “many people who are over 65 are taking prescription medications.” In fact, more than 4 in 10 adults 65 and older take at least five prescription drugs a day, and nearly 20 percent take 10 or more, according to a Lown Institute report. What’s more, older people don’t metabolize compounds found in drugs and supplements as efficiently as their younger peers. “So taking excessive supplements can certainly lead to more problems in someone [who has a harder time] getting it out of their system, because the kidneys are not functioning like they would in a 20- or 30-year-old,” he explains.

Ginkgo biloba Source: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health/NIH Be a savvy consumer The guidance from experts isn’t to avoid supplements entirely but to exercise caution when using them. “These products are health products and should be considered just like over-the-counter medications,” Cohen says. “We know that we have to be careful with [drugs like aspirin and Motrin]. And supplements should be treated the same way.” His advice: If you’re interested in starting a supplement, step back and think about why you want to take it, and then bring that concern to your doctor. “We actually know that going out and taking a multivitamin just for general health — to prevent heart disease, cancer, you name it — doesn’t work,” he says. So ask your physician if you have a health issue that can be alleviated with a vitamin, mineral or other product. (You can also check out the FDA’s new Supplement Your Knowledge initiative for a list of other questions to bring up with a health care provider regarding supplement use.) If you are already taking a supplement — and more than half of Americans are — it’s important to let your doctor know, says Cara Welch, director of the FDA’s Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Keep a record of what you are taking and how often. Or, better yet, bring the bottles to your next appointment so your doctor can take a look “and adjust accordingly, based on what they know about the patient,” Welch says. If a supplement is recommended, look for one that has a stamp from NSF International or U.S. Pharmacopeia, Cohen suggests. These third-party groups test supplements and verify that they contain the ingredients listed on the label and that they aren’t tainted with harmful substances. And remember that a supplement “should not claim to treat, cure or prevent disease,” Welch says. If you see one that does, that’s a red flag. Finally, if you experience side effects or a bad reaction after taking a supplement, stop taking the product and report it to the FDA. “We have physicians that review every single one of those adverse-event reports to see if they indicate an issue with a particular product or a particular ingredient,” Welch says.

A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that in 2020, 8.4 percent of adults regularly took prescription or over-the-counter sleep medication to help them fall or stay asleep, up from 4 percent about a decade ago. When it comes to those 65 and older, 12 percent regularly took something to help get shuteye. “Frankly, the news is really not surprising to those of us working in sleep medicine,” says Robert Satriale, M.D., a clinical adjunct professor and sleep medicine specialist at Temple Health in Philadelphia. Studies show about 1 in 3 adults don’t get enough sleep (about 7 hours a night for adults 50 and older, Satriale says) on a regular basis, and an estimated 50 million to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep disorders. “And these patients are often in the older age groups,” says Satriale, who explains that sleep quality tends to decline with age. Video: 5 Things to Know About Getting Better Sleep It’s no surprise, then, that older adults are more likely to turn to medications for an assist. But there are a few things you need to know before you do. 1. Medications can come with dangerous side effects Newer sleep medications like zolpidem (Ambien) and eszopiclone (Lunesta) have a “somewhat safer” profile than older drugs prescribed for sleep troubles, says K. Ashley Garling-Nañez, clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy. Still, “anything that’s going to be sedating or make you sleepy is going to put you at risk for dizziness, falls, that sort of thing,” Garling-Nañez says. Video: 5 Things to Know About Getting Better Sleep Research shows that both these newer drugs and the older benzodiazepines can impair mental and physical function in older adults, leading to an increased risk for falls and confusion. “And then of course, combined with other medications — especially anything for pain, mood, anxiety — could possibly put you at a higher risk of suppressing your breathing and respiratory depression,” Garling-Nañez adds. It’s not just prescription medicines that demand caution. Over-the-counter options come with a list of unpleasant and potentially dangerous side effects, too. For example, diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in many over-the-counter sleep aids like Advil PM, Tylenol PM and ZZZQuil, has been linked to an increased risk for cognitive decline and confusion in older adults, as well as urinary retention, constipation and next-day grogginess, which can interfere with driving ability, Satriale points out. More than 6,000 fatal crashes each year involve a drowsy driver, according to the CDC. Melatonin’s Popularity A 2022 study published in the journal JAMA tracked a fivefold increase in melatonin use among U.S. adults over the past few decades. An increasing number of Americans are also taking more than the recommended amount of the supplement, the researchers found. Supplements deserve a similar level of scrutiny. For example, valerian root, an herbal supplement often marketed to improve sleep, can cause dizziness, dry mouth and mental dullness. Garling-Nañez warns that this product may also be mixed in with other sleep supplements, such as melatonin, which comes with its own list of possible side effects. So it’s always a good idea to have a pharmacist go through ingredients with you before purchasing an over-the-counter product, Garling-Nañez says. 2. You may be masking underlying health issue﻿s Taking something to help you sleep may be a quick fix, but it could be causing you to overlook an underlying health condition that’s behind your insomnia. Take, for example, anxiety. “When you’re lying there and your mind’s turning over and over and you can’t shut your brain off to go to bed, that can sometimes be a form of anxiety,” Garling-Nañez says. It’s not uncommon for a condition known as restless leg syndrome to keep older adults up at night, Satriale says. “And this is a condition that is easily treatable and something [patients] should discuss with their physicians, if present,” he adds. Melatonin’s Popularity A 2022 study published in the journal JAMA tracked a fivefold increase in melatonin use among U.S. adults over the past few decades. An increasing number of Americans are also taking more than the recommended amount of the supplement, the researchers found. An overactive thyroid, sleep apnea, diabetes and chronic pain have also been linked to sleep problems. So have prescription medications, including certain antidepressants and treatments for asthma and high blood pressure, which your doctor may be able to adjust. 3. There are better treatments than pill﻿s Having trouble sleeping? It’s important to talk to your doctor, especially given the links between poor sleep and other health problems like heart disease, diabetes and depression. Your primary care provider may be able to help you or may refer you to a sleep specialist or therapist trained in cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which experts in the field say is the first line of treatment for sleep problems. This form of therapy helps patients identify and address the habits and behaviors that keep them from getting the sleep they need. It also equips them with stress reduction and relaxation techniques. A review of research published in Annals of Internal Medicine found CBT-I to be effective in the general population and in older adults with chronic insomnia disorder. And unlike medication, CBT-I “is likely to have fewer harms,” the researchers note. Don’t discount lifestyle tweaks that can lead to improved sleep. “Exercise is extremely important in helping people sleep,” Satriale says. “People who exercise on a regular basis will attain sleep quicker and they will stay asleep longer than those people with sedentary lifestyles.” Current guidelines recommend that older adults aim for about 30 minutes a day of moderate-intensity activity, like brisk walking. Caffeine intake and late meals can also affect your slumber. A few other tips: Keep the TV off and the lights low a few hours before bed, Satriale advises. White or brown noise and a weighted blanket can also help.﻿ Editor's note: This story, originally published March 1, 2023, has been updated.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/medications-that-can-cause-insomnia/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series 10 Common Medications That Can Affect Sleep Trouble catching z’s? Your prescription and over-the-counter meds may be to blame By Ashley Garling, Pharm.D, Updated July 30, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published April 08, 2013 / Updated July 30, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Shutterstock) In this story Cold and allergy decongestants • ​Asthma medications • ​Blood pressure medications • Diabetes medications​ • Dementia medications​ • Mood and anxiety medications • ​Pain medications • ​Prostate medications •​ Stimulants​ • Steroids​ Just as our bodies and minds change throughout life, so does our ability to get the recommended seven-plus hours of good, quality sleep each night. In fact, it’s estimated that 40 to 70 percent of older adults routinely experience sleep problems, like difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Insufficient sleep doesn’t just wreck your mind and mood the next day; it’s a symptom of a number of chronic health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and depression. What’s more, lack of sleep can increase your risk of accidents and falls. Poor sleep can be traced back to a number of causes, from stress to screen time to health-related issues like heartburn. Commonly used prescription and over-the-counter medications can also contribute. What is Insomnia? Insomnia is a common sleep disorder characterized by trouble falling asleep, staying asleep or getting good-quality sleep. Short-term insomnia can be caused by stress or changes in your schedule or environment; chronic insomnia occurs at least three nights a week and lasts more than three months. Insomnia is the most common sleep problem in adults 60 and older. Source: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute What are non-REM parasomnias? Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) parasomnias are actions you do during the early stages of sleep. Though you’re not awake and may not remember them, they can disrupt your sleep. Non-REM parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep talking, sleep eating, confusional arousals (waking up disoriented and confused) and night terrors (awakening in a frightened state). A number of medications can cause these sleep-related disorders, including anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines, certain antidepressants, high blood pressure medicines, antipsychotic drugs, anti-seizure medications, and asthma or allergy medicines. REM sleep behavior disorder and drugs that cause it REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia where you act out your dreams during the REM stage of sleep. This includes talking, yelling, kicking, punching or even jumping out of bed in response to what’s happening in your dream. “Anything that alters sleep architecture [normal sleep patterns] can cause muscle-related sleep disruptions, or acting out dreams,” says Alex Dimitriu, M.D., who is double board-certified in psychiatry and sleep medicine and the founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine in Menlo Park, California. “Common substances include alcohol, certain antidepressants, sedatives like zolpidem [Ambien﻿] or eszopiclone [Lunesta﻿], and [the beta-blocker] metoprolol ﻿[Lopressor﻿].” Antidepressants may cause REM sleep behavior disorder by altering levels of the brain chemicals dopamine and serotonin, which play a role in REM sleep. Here are 10 sleep-disrupting drugs commonly used by older adults. 1. Cold and allergy decongestants Class of medications: alpha-agonist﻿s; decongestants commonly used for runny nose and nasal congestion Common names: phenylephrine (Sudafed PE), pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and various other combinations. Always check the active ingredients on the product’s label. How they affect sleep: These drugs increase heart rate and heart muscle contractions, which can stir up heart palpitations, anxiety, blood pressure and excitability that prevents sleep or deep sleep. What to do: Because these medications can affect the heart, check with your doctor or pharmacist before reaching for one — an alternative such as a steroid nasal spray may be recommended. If you get the OK from your health care provider and then find you need a decongestant for more than seven days, or if your symptoms are worsening during use, contact your doctor to make sure there’s not another issue causing your symptoms, like an infection. 2. Asthma medications Class of medications: short-acting beta 2-agonists (bronchodilators), commonly called “rescue” medications or inhalers for quick symptom relief Common names: pirbuterol (Maxair Autohaler), albuterol (Proventil HFA, ProAir and Ventolin HFA), levalbuterol (Xopenex) How they affect sleep: Data shows that only 1 to 3.1 percent of the users of these medications experience true insomnia. However, other side effects, such as excitability, headache, heart palpitations and tremors, may be the bigger culprits for the sleep troubles these medications can cause, especially with frequent use. What to do: If you use your rescue asthma inhaler or nebulizer more than twice a week and have trouble sleeping when you do, contact your physician and consider using a preventive medication or long-acting therapy.

Short-term insomnia can be caused by stress or changes in your schedule or environment; chronic insomnia occurs at least three nights a week and lasts more than three months. Insomnia is the most common sleep problem in adults 60 and older. Source: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute 3. Blood pressure medications Class of medications and common names: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec), lisinopril (Prinivil), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace) and many others in this familyBeta-blockers: Propranolol (Inderal), nadolol (CorGard), pindolol (Visken), labetalol (Normodyne), penbutolol (Levatol), sotalol (Betapace) and carvedilol (Coreg) are all considered nonselective for the heart and can lead to more associated sleep disturbances. How they affect sleep: ACE inhibitors do not directly cause insomnia. However, some side effects, such as a dry, persistent cough (from the buildup of an inflammation-causing protein in the body), may affect sleep. Beta-blockers may reduce your natural levels of melatonin, which helps with your sleep cycles, and some, such as carvedilol, can cause nightmares. The drugs metoprolol (Lopressor) and propranolol (Inderal XL) can cross the blood-brain barrier into the brain, reducing sleep quality and causing you to wake up more often after you fall asleep. These beta-blockers are linked to nightmares, insomnia and daytime sleepiness. Beta-blockers may also affect your slumber by suppressing REM sleep (the stage when rapid eye movements and dreaming occur). Atenolol (Tenormin) and bisoprolol may be less likely to cause insomnia than other beta-blockers. What to do: Do not stop taking these without talking to your doctor. These medications are not only used for blood pressure; they may also protect your kidneys and heart from more severe problems. Your doctor may lower the dose of your medication or recommend an alternative therapy that causes fewer changes in sleep. 4. Diabetes medications Class of medications: sulfonylureas, meglitinides, antihyperglycemics, hormones Common names: glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), nateglinide (Starlix), insulin How they affect sleep: People with diabetes who take insulin or certain oral medications that lower blood glucose may experience nocturnal hypoglycemia, when blood glucose levels fall below 70 mg/dl at night. Low blood sugar can cause restless and irritable sleep, along with symptoms such as night sweats, shaking, changes in breathing, nightmares and a racing heartbeat. What to do: Talk to your doctor if you are having sleep issues. If you’re dealing with nocturnal hypoglycemia, your doctor may change the dose or timing of your insulin or other medications, monitor your glucose levels with scheduled testing, or use a continuous monitor that wakes you if levels drop too low. Other factors like sleep apnea or poor sleep hygiene may also need an evaluation. 5. Dementia medications Class of medications: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Common names: donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne), rivastigmine (Exelon) How they affect sleep: People with dementia and those experiencing changes in memory often have disrupted sleep cycles. To add to it, medications used to treat these conditions often have “wake-promoting” effects meant to help improve alertness. Side effects of these medications, such as pain, muscle cramps, increased blood pressure, agitation and lack of appetite (which can cause low blood sugar), can also disrupt sleep. What to do: Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons before stopping or changing these treatments, which help many people manage the symptoms of dementia. Also, make sure no other causes of sleeplessness are to blame, such as infections, pain or poor sleep hygiene. 6. Mood and anxiety medications Class of medications and common names: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor﻿s: fluoxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), fluvoxamine (Luvox)Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor﻿s: venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), milnacipran (Savella), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), duloxetine (Cymbalta)Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs): bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban, Aplenzin) How they affect sleep: Depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions often cause sleep problems if not treated with medication. These medications can improve baseline sleep, but occasionally their actions on common neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine) can worsen sleep. Typically, the worsened symptoms are continuity of sleep, delayed REM (rapid eye movement, the sleep phase when most dreams occur) and less REM sleep. The antidepressant medication Wellbutrin can also keep you awake. “Wellbutrin is a very stimulating medication that can cause insomnia for some people,” says Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist and sleep specialist practicing in Los Angeles. What to do: Take these medicines in the morning, rather than at night. Stop or change one of these medications only after talking to a doctor, since stopping abruptly can cause adverse effects. A lower dose may help improve sleep; alternative therapies in other drug classes may also be available. 7. Pain medications Class of medications: opioid pain relievers Common names: fentanyl (Duragesic), morphine (Avinza), hydrocodone (Norco), oxycodone (OxyContin), oxymorphone (Opana) and tramadol (Ultram) How they affect sleep: Pain can make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. In some people, opioid pain medications, which are sometimes prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain following surgery or an injury, can contribute to sleep issues by causing altered sleep cycles and even apnea, which is when breathing stops and restarts throughout the sleep cycle. What to do: If you were prescribed opioids for short-term pain relief, talk to your doctor about alternating the prescribed opioid with acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) to minimize the opioid use. Some prescription pain relievers already contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen, so check with your pharmacist before using multiple medications at the same time. Additionally, lifestyle changes (like exercise and weight loss), behavioral treatment (cognitive behavioral therapy), physical therapy, complementary medicine (like acupuncture) and alternative medicine therapies can help improve quality of life in people suffering from pain. 8. Prostate medications Class of medications: alpha-blockers Common names: alfuzosin (Uroxatral), doxazosin (Cardura), prazosin (Minipress), silodosin (Rapaflo), terazosin (Hytrin) and tamsulosin (Flomax) How they affect sleep: Alpha-blockers usually don’t cause sleep problems, but they can reduce REM sleep. REM is a critical component of the sleep cycle because, in addition to its role in dreaming, it’s also involved in memory, emotional processing and healthy brain development. What to do: If you are using an alpha-blocking medication for the treatment of prostate symptoms and are experiencing sleep problems including insomnia, talk to your doctor about using the lowest effective dose or changing to another family of drugs, such as a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor like dutasteride (Avodart) or finasteride (Proscar). These are safer and generally better tolerated by older adults. 9. Stimulants Class of medications: Stimulants work in the central nervous system and increase alertness, attention and energy. Although commonly used for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), these medications are also used to treat conditions affecting alertness and concentration, especially in older adults. Common names: amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall), methylphenidate (Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), dexmethylphenidate (Focalin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) and many other formulations How they affect sleep: Stimulants can make it take longer for a person to fall asleep (this is called sleep onset latency) and are associated with insomnia and disruptions to a person’s internal sleep clock. What to do: Talk to your doctor about the benefits and drawbacks of using a stimulant medication. Ask about adjusting the dose or changing the time you take it to improve your sleep. Additionally, non-stimulants — such as atomoxetine (Strattera), clonidine (﻿Kapvay), ﻿viloxazine (Qelbree) and guanfacine (Intuniv) — could be effective, depending on the condition being treated. 10. Steroids Class of medications: Glucocorticoids, or steroids, are used as short-term anti-inflammatory medications or long-term immunosuppressive agents for conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, leukemia, lymphoma and systemic lupus. Common names: prednisone (Deltasone), methyl-prednisolone (Medrol), dexamethasone (Decadron) How they affect sleep: With steroids, changes in sleep may be due to restlessness caused by the medications, along with decreased natural melatonin levels and disruption of sleep cycles. What to do: In drug studies, insomnia associated with the use of these medications was considered mild; however, symptoms can be made worse with high doses and long-term use. Only use these medications if needed, in the lowest possible amount, and as your doctor prescribes. If your condition worsens and you need additional steroid symptom relief, talk to your doctor about maintenance medications to treat those symptoms. How do you know whether your medicine, or something else, is disrupting your sleep? Timing is everything, experts say. “It helps to look at when the sleep trouble began and see if it correlates with the start of a particular medication,” Dimitriu says. You might also try taking your medicine in the morning rather than at night to see if that makes a difference. If you’re having trouble sleeping and are taking any of these medications, it’s important that you don’t stop taking them. Talk to your health care provider, who may be able to adjust your dose or recommend a different medication that can achieve the same results. There are also lifestyle changes that can help improve underlying conditions, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy, which is the first-line treatment for insomnia.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/how-to-gain-weight-safely/#comments_widget_id,"How to Gain Weight Fast and Safely in 10 Steps Effective ways to gain weight and muscle if you are underweight By Beth Howard, Updated March 19, 2025 AARP Medically reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published December 06, 2023 / Updated March 19, 2025 HUIZENG HU / Getty Images Research shows that people who maintain a healthy weight may live longer. So if you’re on the thin side, should you consider plumping up? Not necessarily. If you come from a naturally thin family or have consistently had a low body mass index (BMI), a lighter-than-average weight may not be a problem. “Sometimes people have a low BMI but they’re perfectly healthy,” says Allison Miner, a professor of nutrition and dietetics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. (A BMI less than 18.5 is considered underweight.) Some research has found that having a bit of extra weight as you age may even be good for you. Some studies have found people with higher BMIs after 60 may have a lower dementia risk than those who were underweight or have a normal weight — though it might be because people lose weight as dementia begins to take hold. Having a healthy weight seems to be important for bone strength as well. Being underweight is a risk factor for osteoporosis and increases risk of fractures. (Obesity has been associated with risk for fractures in some cases, so striving for a healthy weight is best.) Calculate Your BMI Try AARP’s Body Mass Index Calculator and determine your healthy weight. Unintentionally shedding pounds due to things like illness, depression or a medication that steals your appetite can spell danger in your older years. “Unhealthy weight loss can lead to a state called sarcopenia, which is when you’ve lost so much muscle mass that you don’t have enough for healthy function,” says Naomi Parrella, M.D., chief of lifestyle medicine at Rush University System for Health in Chicago. Trying to gain weight for health reasons sound like an enviable challenge for much of the country but, experts say, putting on pounds can be just as difficult as taking them off. The challenge is making sure that the weight you’re putting on is made up of more muscle than fat. The good news: “The human body is designed to heal and thrive no matter how old you are,” Parrella says. When it comes to losing weight, men typically have it easier since they have more lean muscle mass than women. Plus they tend to drop weight faster because they have more pounds to lose compared to women. Meanwhile, women have an easier time gaining weight. As people age, maintaining a healthy weight can become a challenge—but not always in the way you might expect. While it’s often easier for women to gain weight, men generally have an advantage when it comes to losing it due to their higher lean muscle mass. They also tend to drop pounds more quickly because they typically start with more weight to lose. However, for both men and women, the real concern with aging isn’t just weight management—it’s the gradual loss of muscle mass that naturally occurs over time. Quick tips for gaining healthy weight Small changes to your meals and snacks can make a big difference, reccommends Rachel Gargano, chief registered dietitian at Live it Up and a board-certified nutritionist in sports dietetics and breastfeeding. Gaining weight in a healthy way means focusing on nutrient-dense foods that provide extra calories without making you feel overly full. Here is her expert advice: Drizzle extra oil or butter on your meals—since they're packed with calories but don’t take up much space, it’s an easy way to get more in without feeling too full.Make a PB&J on whole wheat bread, cut it into four pieces, and snack on one throughout the day. Small bites add up!Blend up a smoothie for a snack. Use whole milk, nut butter, banana, and frozen fruit or baby spinach for extra nutrients and fiber. Want even more calories? Toss in a little olive.Sprinkle seeds, nuts, or avocado on meals and snacks to sneak in extra calories without much effort.Don’t skip snacks! Go for high-calorie options like nut or seed butters, whole nuts, avocado, milk or reduced-fat Greek yogurt—make sure to avoid saturated fats which can raise cholestoral. Here’s 10 more strategies to help you put on healthy weight: 1. Talk to your doctor Before focusing on gaining weight, it’s worth asking—why was it lost in the first place? Could it be from medication side effects, dental issues like poorly fitting dentures, a recent illness or hospital stay, or even changes in mood like depression? Calculate Your BMI Try AARP’s Body Mass Index Calculator and determine your healthy weight. If you’re recovering from an illness like cancer, ask your doctor if there are any limitations or considerations you should be aware of as you regain the weight. Likewise, if you’re too blue to feel like eating, seek mental health treatment. pamela_d_mcadams / Getty Images Snack break No-Bake Peanut Butter Balls 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter, store-bought or homemade 1½ cups oats, old fashioned 1/2 cup finely chopped or powdered nuts (any type) 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/3 cup dried cranberries or raisins 1 TB vanilla extract 1 tsp flax or chia seeds Combine the ingredients, adjusting the amount of peanut butter to ensure a firm texture that is not too sticky. Smooth peanut butter provides more calories than chunky peanut butter because the body is more efficient in digesting smooth peanut butter. Roll into tablespoon-size balls and place on parchment paper. Cover and refrigerate. —Alison Miner 2. Focus on gaining muscle mass When you are increasing the number on the scale, good nutrition and strength training should go hand in hand, says David Creel, director of exercise physiology at the Bariatric & Metabolic Institute at Cleveland Clinic. Strong muscles are key to doing the things you want to as you age and avoiding frailty. “When we’re talking about loss of muscle, we’re concerned about function, like being able to carry your groceries,” Creel says. That’s where strength training comes in. You don’t have to work out at the gym or with a trainer, though if you’re new to this type of exercise, a few sessions can be beneficial to learn the proper form. You can get a decent workout at home using small weights or resistance bands, or just lift household objects (soup cans, milk jugs). Do push-ups against a wall using gravity and your body as the weight, squats while holding onto a counter, and crunches for your core. Aim to work out two days per week, but not on consecutive days, Creel advises. To get started, check out workout videos for simple strength training exercises on our﻿ Staying Fit page. ﻿ 3. Eat more often For most healthy adults, three balanced meals a day about five hours apart is the ideal meal schedule, Miner says. If you want to gain weight naturally, though, you need to increase meal frequency. Instead of your typical three meals, add a hearty snack three hours after breakfast and lunch and another one before bed. 4. Increase protein intake To gain muscle mass instead of fat, you need high protein foods—and plenty of it. “As we get older, our body needs to take in a little bit more protein to stimulate muscle growth and for muscle maintenance,” Parrella says. It’s also necessary for strength training, Creel says. “You want to make sure that you’ve got the resources to put on the weight as muscle,” he says. The general recommendation is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (about 3.6 grams per 10 pounds). But “we’re finding that it’s better to get more like 1.2 or 1.3 grams per kilogram in someone who is trying to gain weight,” Creel says. People absorb protein less effectively as they age, so it’s important to spread your intake throughout the day. A good rule of thumb is to consume 25 to 50 grams of protein, three or four times a day, or every time you eat. “Otherwise, you can’t absorb enough protein at a time to maintain your muscle mass,” Parrella says. In addition to animal protein like chicken, beef and fish, consider soy products like tofu and edamame. You can also get quality protein from dairy products and nuts and by combining legumes with grains — amaranth and quinoa are particularly high in protein. And mix whey protein powder with smoothies, or drink packaged whey protein shakes. pamela_d_mcadams / Getty Images Snack break No-Bake Peanut Butter Balls 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter, store-bought or homemade 1½ cups oats, old fashioned 1/2 cup finely chopped or powdered nuts (any type) 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/3 cup dried cranberries or raisins 1 TB vanilla extract 1 tsp flax or chia seeds Combine the ingredients, adjusting the amount of peanut butter to ensure a firm texture that is not too sticky. Smooth peanut butter provides more calories than chunky peanut butter because the body is more efficient in digesting smooth peanut butter. Roll into tablespoon-size balls and place on parchment paper. Cover and refrigerate. —Alison Miner 5. Have a large breakfast People tend to be hungry when they wake up in the morning, so use this to your advantage and eat a full breakfast. “That’s when you really want to deliver the calories,” says Miner. “Eating more calories when you’re hungry is really the key.” Appetite wanes in the evening, so you can eat less then. 6. Eat more calories and fat Even if they know they should gain weight, many people are afraid to add fat to their diets, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, dietitian and author of Read It Before You Eat It: Taking You From Label to Table. “Fats like almonds, avocado, nut butters, and olive and avocado oils are great ways to get healthy fat in your diet, get concentrated calories, but not have a negative impact on your health.” Miner suggests cooking rice and oatmeal with milk, even evaporated milk, to add calories. And use coconut milk as a base in stews and curries. Feel free to enjoy whole-fat yogurt. “The latest evidence on the full-fat yogurt and even cheese, believe it or not, is that they do not increase blood cholesterol levels,” Miner says. 7. Eat energy-dense meals “A meal with a salad, a main dish and different sides is a lot of food to eat for someone who may not be used to eating that much,” Taub-Dix says. “And a big salad before a meal could be too filling. You want to make the meal more concentrated. The goal is less volume of food.” One-dish meals that combine vegetables, legumes, and chicken or fish (think: stews and soups) are a good option, Taub-Dix says. If you really want a salad, make it count: Include beans, nuts, avocados and dressing made with healthy oils like olive oil — nothing fat-free.

Blend on high for 1½ minutes. Drink between meals or as a meal substitute. —Alison Miner 8. Take your time Just as people should lose weight gradually, making behavioral changes that will stick, you should take a measured approach to healthy weight gain. “Adding 300 to 500 calories a day is a good place to start,” Creel says. That should allow you to gain about a half pound to ﻿a pound a week. ﻿ 9. Drink your calories Downing a lot of high-calorie beverages is one of the ways that people gain weight, so it’s the natural strategy for adding heft to your frame, Creel says. Instead of plain water, drink milk or 100 percent juice, he says. Smoothies are the perfect choice. “The reason we use them for weight gain is because the body doesn’t have to do anything to break it down,” Miner says. “So all the calories that you’re taking in will be absorbed.” You can even add whole or ground nuts to the mix. “The body is not efficient in breaking nuts down,” Miner says. “If I were to give someone a half cup of nuts to eat, they might only absorb a half to three-quarters of the calories as if they were blended into a drink.” Start with an instant breakfast drink or protein powder and add nuts and whole milk or almond milk. Then experiment with Greek yogurt, 100 percent juices, fruit and nut butters. 10. Stimulate your appetite “It’s really hard to force yourself to eat when you’re not hungry,” says Miner. And older people tend to have a lower appetite to start with. Solution? If a prescribed medication is wrecking your appetite, ask your doctor if there’s a substitute and troubleshoot other medical issues that might be robbing your appetite. You can also ask a doctor about medications that increase hunger, such as megestrol acetate, oxandrolone or dronabinol. Food should also seem more appealing after exercise, Creel says. In addition to resistance training, try some light cardio in the pool, he advises. “There’s evidence that swimming, especially in cold water, may stimulate appetite more than exercise on dry land, as your body has to generate more heat,” he says. “It’s also a great activity for older adults who might have some limitations as well.” Anna_Shepulova / Getty Images Smoothie Time High-Calorie/High-Protein Smoothie 1 cup of whole cow’s milk or whole milk yogurt (substitute coconut milk, if vegan).

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eye-color-and-medical-conditions/,"What Your Eye Color Can Say About Your Health Plus 8 types of changes in eye color that indicate problems By Hallie Levine, Updated February 18, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published September 08, 2022 / Updated February 18, 2025 Getty Images More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health Your eyes are said to be the window to your soul — but they may also be a window to your health. Your eye color may signal a predisposition to certain medical conditions, such as skin or eye cancer. And while actual changes in eye color are rare, they can also indicate an underlying health disorder that needs to be addressed. “Eyes can appear to change color due to an undiagnosed disease, a new medication or even trauma,” says David Silverstone, M.D., a professor of ophthalmology at the Yale School of Medicine. Sometimes, he adds, it’s due to an actual change in the iris, the colored part of your eye, and sometimes it’s due to something going on in another part of your eye that appears to change the eye color. Here’s a look at what your eye color can mean for your health. Can eye color predict your health? Your eye color may offer some clues about how likely you are to develop certain cancers, or certain forms of eye disease, later on. Here’s what the research shows: Those with lighter eyes have higher skin cancer risk. A 2022 study published in Cancer Causes and Control that looked at more than 35,000 men found that, compared to people with dark eyes, those with hazel, green or blue eyes had higher risk of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, two of the most common forms of skin cancer. The men with hazel or green eyes had a 24 percent higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma, while those with blue eyes had a 19 percent higher risk. People who have less pigment in their eyes tend to have less pigment in their skin, which raises risk of skin cancer, says Davinder Grover, M.D., a Dallas ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology﻿. Not surprisingly, other research also suggests that folks with light-colored irises (blue or green) have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma than those with darker orbs. People with brown eyes have a lower incidence of macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.﻿ Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an age-related condition in which a part of your retina, the macula, is damaged. This causes you to lose your central vision so that you cannot see fine details. It’s the leading cause of vision loss in people age 50 and older. Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes-related condition that affects the blood vessels in your retina; over time, it can cause vision loss. It may be that pigment itself offers some protection, Grover says. The American Academy of Ophthalmology says those with brown eyes have a lower incidence of both of these conditions. People with dark eyes may be more likely to develop cataracts. You’re not off the hook if you have dark eyes: Research suggests you’re more likely to develop cataracts. Studies have found that people with dark brown eyes have a higher risk of cataracts than those with lighter-colored eyes, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Researchers aren’t sure why this might be true. The authors of one review study speculated that the increased melanin in the irises of brown-eyed people could cause a buildup of heat in the eyes that is linked to cataracts. It’s also possible that the higher risk of cataracts in those with brown eyes may not be directly related to eye color but to where those people live. “We know there is a connection between sun exposure and cataracts, and most people with darker eyes live closer to the equator,” Grover says. More research needs to be done to understand the link, but no matter the color of your eyes, you should wear sunglasses that provide 100 percent protection from all UV light, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health What changes in eye color may mean for your health If you notice any change in your eye color, you should always get it checked out by your eye doctor, Grover stresses. It can indicate a wide range of conditions, some benign, some potentially serious. They include: 1. A hazy blue or white ring that forms around your cornea This condition, called arcus senilisis, is caused by a build-up of lipids, or fat, in your eye. Most older adults develop it, and it’s usually harmless, Grover says. But it can make your eyes appear a different color. Grover recalls patients brought in by younger relatives concerned that the patients’ brown eyes had turned blue. If you do notice this ring, it’s always good to let both your eye doctor and your primary care provider know, since it can be a sign of high cholesterol. 2. Pigment loss Certain eye conditions can cause your orbs to lose pigment over time, Grover says. One is pigmentary glaucoma, a condition where pigment rubs off of the back of your iris, raising eye pressure. It can also happen after cataract surgery: “If a lens is placed in the wrong position, it can cause pigment to be released into the eye,” Grover says. Both are treatable, so it’s very important to see your eye doctor if you notice any symptoms, such as halos or blurred vision. 3. Iris freckles Just like you get freckles on your skin from sun exposure, you can also get them on your eye, Grover says. These are small brown spots on your iris that can make your eyes look like they’ve changed color. They’re harmless but should be checked out by an eye doctor. You can also develop iris nevi, which are dark growths on your eye that look like a mole and are in fact caused by the same pigment cells, called melanocytes. While most aren’t dangerous, they can raise your risk of developing eye cancer. 4. Red in the clear covering over your eye Uveitis is an inflammation of the middle layer of your eyeball. It can be caused by an infection such as shingles, or from an inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Most often, it just makes your conjunctiva — the clear covering over your eye — look red, Grover says. But it can also make your eye color look different if the inflammation causes your iris to stick to your lens. If you notice any redness or eye color changes, accompanied by light sensitivity, blurry vision and/or seeing floaters, contact your eye doctor right away because uveitis can be serious; it can even lead to vision loss. 5. Large ﻿black pupils If you’ve had a blow to the eye, damage to the iris can cause tissue loss that makes the eye appear as if it’s a different color. “If the trauma is bad enough, the pupil might stay dilated, which can make the eye appear black,” Silverstone says. If this happens, it’s very important that you see your doctor for medical treatment, and also to rule out another serious condition that could cause dilated pupils such as a brain injury or stroke. 6. Different-colored eyes caused by different pupil sizes This very rare condition affects the eye and surrounding tissue on only one side of the face. It’s usually due to a stroke, tumor or spinal cord injury. One symptom is uneven pupil size, which can make it look like you have different-colored eyes, Grover says. 7. Clouding of the lens Cataracts can cause a clouding of the eye lens that can make your eye look milky white, Silverstone says. About a quarter of people in their late 60s will have a cataract, and more than a third of people in their 70s, according to the National Eye Institute. Cataracts can easily be removed with surgery. 8. Brown eyes becoming darker, hazel eyes turning brown If you have glaucoma, the first-line treatment is often a class of medications called prostaglandins that can change eye color. “It can make brown or hazel eyes turn more brown or a darker shade of brown,” says Grover, who notes that it doesn’t usually cause color changes in blue or green eyes. If you use the lash-growing prescription medication Latisse, you may notice these changes, too, Silverstone adds. It’s important to remember that while your grandbaby’s eyes may have changed color from lighter to darker during the first year of life, as their body develops pigment, your eyes should stay constant. That’s why if you notice any eye color changes, don’t panic, but do get them checked out. Editor's note: This story, originally published Sept. 8, 2022, has been updated with new information.

Heck, I love dessert, period. And I actually eat it a lot more often than one would guess. I'm very careful that my meals do not contain hidden sugars (did you know that 2 tablespoons of bottled salad dressing can have more than a cookie?) so I can enjoy desserts without exceeding recommended daily allowances for sugar overall. I know I'm not alone in craving chocolate and sweets and just baking more in general as we stay safely home these days. Instead of following a super fattening recipe that could really set you back, I hope you'll try one of these. Chocolate Not-Only-In-Your-Dreams Cake I dreamed of eating a rich, flourless chocolate cake like this for years; I'm one of those “There's no such thing as chocolate cake that's too rich” types. Even when dieting, I have to “cheat” with chocolate from time to time just to keep my sanity. And then came this cake. It's as rich as they come, and I love it more than any other ﬂourless chocolate espresso cake I've had. Plus, it packs 6 grams of ﬁber, so it really is guilt free! If you want to impress your friends (when you're able to see them) or if you're in quarantine alone, store some in the freezer, unbaked, in the ramekins placed within an airtight container. When you need a no-fuss dessert, pop the ramekins in a glass pan filled with some water, as described below, and bake for 30 to 32 minutes. Ingredients Butter-ﬂavored cooking spray1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce1 teaspoon vanilla extract4 large egg whites1 cup dark or light brown sugar (not packed)3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1/4 teaspoon very ﬁnely ground espresso beans (or 1/2 teaspoon instant coffee)1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon powdered sugar, optional4 raspberries, optionalFour 3 1/2 -inch-diameter ramekins (or any small souffle dishes or heat-proof bowls that are a least a few inches tall) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously mist four 3 1/2 -inch-diameter ramekins with spray. Place them side by side in an 8-by-8-inch baking pan. Add water to the pan until it reaches halfway to the top of the ramekins. Use a sturdy whisk or spatula to mix the applesauce, vanilla, egg whites and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl until well combined. Add the cocoa powder, espresso and salt. Stir until just combined and no lumps remain. Divide evenly among the ramekins (each ramekin will be about two-thirds full). Bake for 21 to 24 minutes, until the tops look silky and puff slightly and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out a bit wet (do not cook them long enough for the toothpick to come out dry). Remove from the oven and carefully transfer the ramekins from the water in the baking pan to a cooling rack. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Then invert each ramekin onto a dessert plate. Let stand for 1 minute, and then slowly lift off the ramekin (the cakes should come out on their own; if they don't, run a knife around the edge of the cakes to loosen them). Cool for another 5 to 10 minutes. Use a ﬁne sieve to evenly dust each cake with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar, if desired. Place one raspberry on the center of each cake, if using. Serve immediately. Makes 4 cakes.

Mitch Mandel Naked Apple Tart In culinary school, I used to make a tart very similar to this one, only it had a crust with enough butter to require a week of working out! Now, I enjoy it naked — without a crust, that is. I prefer the look of this “tart” when it's baked in a round or oval dish. You can use a similar-size square or rectangle dish, if necessary. Note that the tart cooks for quite a while, allowing the apples to transform into layers of soft, sweet deliciousness. The top of the tart will start to look burnt, but don't worry, it's not. It's just the result of juice and cinnamon caramelizing onto the apples — oh, so sweet! Ingredients Butter-flavored cooking spray (or canola oil or avocado oil spray)2 large crisp apples (such as Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Pink Lady or Honey Crisp), peeled3/4 cup 100 percent apple juice (not from concentrate)2 tablespoons coconut sugar (or substitute unpacked light or dark brown sugar)2 teaspoons unsalted butter, melted (salted will work)1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly mist a 10-inch ceramic or glass tart dish with cooking spray. Cut the apples in half lengthwise and remove the cores. Slice each half lengthwise into very thin slices. Starting from the outer edges of the dish, arrange the apple slices, laying them horizontally, in tightly overlapping circles in the bottom of the dish, until all of the apple slices are used (they will make a rose or flower blossom pattern). In a small bowl, whisk together the apple juice, sugar, butter and cinnamon until well combined (the sugar and cinnamon will not dissolve completely). Pour half of the apple juice mixture evenly over the apples. Reserve the remaining half. Bake for 30 minutes. Pour the reserved mixture evenly over the apples. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer, or until the apples are very tender and the glaze has caramelized on the top and around the edges of the tart (it should look almost burnt — dark brown, but not blackened). Cool for 5 minutes, then divide among 4 serving plates or dishes and serve. Makes 4 servings.

Pecan Praline Cookie Thins When my Facebook friends learned that I was working on an all-dessert book, I immediately got inundated with requests for re-creating favorite high-cal classics. One of the most popular requests was for pecan pie. These scrumptious cookies, which are ridiculously low in fat and calories compared to pecan pie, are an ode to those requests. Note: Packages of pecans that say either “dry-toasted” or “dry-roasted” are perfect for this recipe. Just make sure the pecans are not raw — the cookies won't have as much flavor.

Generously mist 8 cups of a nonstick standard muffin tin with spray. Whisk together the egg white and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the pecans and stir until well combined. Spoon the batter (about a scant 1 tablespoon each) into the prepared muffin tin, making sure to distribute the pecans evenly between each muffin cup. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly crisped around the edges, being careful not to burn them. Cool the tin on a rack for 5 minutes, or until the cookies have cooled slightly.

Brandon Bell/Getty Images By Stephanie Watson, Updated May 30, 2025 AARP En español Published August 18, 2022 / Updated May 30, 2025 In his first public remarks since announcing his prostate cancer diagnosis, former President Joe Biden told reporters at a veterans memorial event in Delaware that he is feeling “optimistic” about his prognosis and has started treatment, which according to CNN, involves a daily pill for six weeks. “The expectation is we’re going to be able to beat this,” said Biden, who mentioned he’s also working with a leading surgeon. “My bones are strong. It hasn’t penetrated, so I’m feeling good.” On May 19, Biden’s office announced that the 46th president had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. After he experienced urinary symptoms, doctors discovered a nodule on his prostate that led them to investigate. “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management,” his office said in a statement. Biden’s cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9, according to his office, which suggests his cancer is aggressive. Gleason scores are a grading system for prostate cancer and can range from 6 (low-grade cancer) to 10 (high-grade cancer). When cancer metastasizes to the bones, it can be harder to treat. However, because Biden’s prostate cancer needs hormones to grow, a treatment that deprives the tumor of hormones can be effective. But cancer doctors say that although Biden’s form of cancer is treatable, it’s likely not curable. Here’s a look at some of the symptoms men with prostate cancer may experience — and how doctors diagnose and treat the disease. 5 Warning Signs A few symptoms point to prostate problems, both benign and cancerous. To be safe, inform your doctor if you have any of the following issues: Peeing problems﻿. A weak stream, trouble getting the flow started or an urgent need to go (especially at night) are signs that your prostate is enlarged from BPH or cancer. Blood in your urine﻿. This symptom could indicate a urinary tract infection, but it’s one worth getting checked out. Pain or discomfort when you pee or sit may also be due to an infection, but see your doctor to make sure. Pain in your back, chest or hips is a sign of more advanced cancer that has spread to the bones. Erectile dysfunction﻿. Although this problem plagues some men naturally as they age, prostate cancer also can interfere with your ability to get an erection. Painful ejaculation﻿. Less semen than usual during ejaculation and blood in your semen are other prostate cancer warning signs. ﻿ Understanding prostate cancer If you’re a man of a certain age, your mind may immediately veer to the worst possible scenario for your symptoms: prostate cancer. But while cancer can cause urinary problems, it’s far from the most likely reason. “The vast majority of men with those symptoms don’t have prostate cancer,” explains Todd Morgan, M.D., chief of Urologic Oncology at Michigan Medicine. “They’re usually symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH.” This is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate.

In fact, ﻿about half of men in their 50s and up to 90 percent of those in their 80s have benign prostate growth, or prostate enlargement. As it enlarges, this gland squeezes and narrows your urethra ­— the tube urine passes through to leave your body. BPH is more annoying than harmful, and it’s very treatable. Prostate cancer is common, too, affecting an estimated 1 in 8 men in their lifetime. An estimated 299,010 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 2024, according to the American Cancer Society.﻿ Yet its symptoms typically don’t appear until late in the disease, once the cancer has already spread. Along with urinary symptoms, late-stage prostate cancer can cause bone pain, weight loss and back pain. “Again, pretty generic symptoms that can be hard to recognize and that most of the time represent something totally different,” Morgan says. Deciphering symptoms It’s never a good strategy to self-diagnose. When you have warning signs that suggest BPH or cancer, a trip to your primary care provider or urologist is in order. Along with either reassuring you that what you have is benign or pointing you to treatment if it’s cancer, your doctor can offer therapies to relieve those uncomfortable urinary symptoms so that you can sleep again. Your doctor may start the evaluation by considering your risks for prostate cancer. Age is a big factor. Only about 1 in 456 men are diagnosed before age 50. By age 70, the odds jump to 1 in 11 men. A family history — not only of prostate cancer but also of breast, ovarian, pancreatic or colon cancer — increases your risk as well.﻿ Race matters too. “African American men have a higher risk of prostate cancer diagnosis and a more aggressive prostate cancer and higher risk of death, compared to non-Hispanic white men,” explains Justin R. Gregg, M.D., assistant professor of urology and a ﻿health ﻿disparities ﻿researcher at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The diagnosis The evaluation for prostate cancer includes a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test. If you’re in your 50s or 60s, you may have already had one or more of these screening tests, which measure a protein produced by prostate cancer cells. The problem is that normal prostate tissue also produces this protein, which can lead to false-positive results. “It’s not a perfect test,” Morgan says. “Many men with an elevated PSA don’t have prostate cancer.” An elevated PSA result could prompt your doctor to have you undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or biopsy for a cancer that doesn’t exist. And even if these tests detect prostate cancer, it could be the slow-growing kind that will never cause problems or need treatment. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against PSA tests for men age 70 and older. For men ages 55 to 69, the task force suggests discussing potential harms and benefits with a health care provider. The American Cancer Society recommends having that discussion with your doctor starting at age 50.﻿ “Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men,” the USPSTF wrote in its 2018 recommendation, adding that false-positive results can lead to “additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction.” Still, the PSA test has its benefits. “If we detect a prostate cancer that has not spread but has the potential to be harmful in the future, we can recommend treatments to potentially cure the cancer,” Gregg says. Adding a digital rectal exam (DRE) can help your doctor fine-tune the diagnosis. “Larger prostates are more likely to be large because of BPH rather than prostate cancer,” Morgan says. “It’s because BPH also causes PSA to rise.” A firm lump will point your doctor in the direction of cancer, even if you have a low PSA level. A strong suspicion of prostate cancer after a DRE and a PSA test will usually lead to an MRI, which highlights any questionable spots. If something suspicious shows up on the MRI, a biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. To treat or not to treat? That is the question, and the answer depends on the results of your Gleason score. This scale, which goes from 6 to 10, grades your cancer based on how different the cells look from normal prostate cells. “The Gleason 6 cancers, which are very common, are the lowest kind of prostate cancer,” Morgan says. “It’s basically impossible for them to leave the prostate.” Treating a low-grade cancer that’s unlikely to spread could unnecessarily expose you to the risks of surgery and radiation, though newer, more precise procedures have become available. Instead, your doctor may recommend active surveillance. “Usually, it’s a visit to the urologist every six months or so, following the PSA blood level, doing rectal exams and possibly doing MRIs and additional testing to monitor the prostate cancer,” Gregg says. You’ll also get occasional biopsies to make sure the cancer cells haven’t turned aggressive; if they have, your doctor will upgrade you to treatment with prostatectomy surgery or radiation therapy. Older men may get by with watchful waiting, instead of active surveillance. Though the terms sound similar, the approach is slightly different. Watchful waiting is a more laid-back strategy that includes a yearly PSA test but little else. “It’s a term that’s applied to patients who are older, where it’s really unlikely that surgery or radiation is ever going to be recommended,” Morgan says. “If somebody has a life expectancy of less than 10 years, even if the cancer changes, they’re likely not going to need treatment.” Don’t rely on symptoms If you’re in your 50s or 60s, prostate cancer should be on your radar. Ask your doctor about your risks and whether you should undergo a PSA screening. Because symptoms often don’t appear until this cancer has spread and is harder to treat, a PSA screening can be valuable. “It allows us to pick up cancer many years earlier than we would otherwise,” Morgan says.​ ﻿Editor’s note: This story, first published Aug. 18, 2022, has been updated to include new information.

Ebenhack via AP; Getty Images; Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images; Shutterstock) Chrissy Bernal has caught COVID-19 three times, most recently in ­October 2023. “My symptoms were always pretty mild,” she says. But after her third round of the virus, she ­developed extreme allergies to foods she used to eat all the time: oats, dairy, gluten, sesame seeds and peanuts. “I literally have some level of anaphylaxis every single day,” she says. In May, Bernal, 46, a public relations professional in Houston, went into anaphylactic shock during a virtual meeting. “I had to inject myself with an Epi while everyone watched in horror on Zoom,” she says. Natalie Nichols, 53, has been struggling with debilitating asthma and severe food allergies since she first caught COVID more than three years ago. “Last fall, I spent ­two-and-a-half months confined to bed, ­motionless, because moving, including holding a cellphone, made me too short of breath,” she says. She’s also experienced brain fog, high blood pressure, hyper­glycemia, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. Nichols, the founder of a nonprofit in Nacogdoches, Texas, recently underwent surgery to repair joint damage caused by COVID-induced inflammation. Lorraine W., of Clarence Center, New York, was looking forward to an active retirement when she was diagnosed with COVID in March 2020. “I’ve never returned to my pre-COVID self,” says Lorraine, 65. She’s on medication to treat small blood vessel damage to her heart and continues to battle a lingering cough, fatigue and breathlessness, as well as kidney disease. Neurological changes have made her legs unsteady when she walks, requiring her to use balance poles. “None of these conditions were present before COVID,” Lorraine says. In June, the National Academies of ­Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a comprehensive definition of long COVID: “an infection-­associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” According to that definition, 18 million Americans have experienced long COVID; currently, more than 1 in 20 of us are living with its symptoms. Researchers have begun to link long-term COVID with another recent phenomenon: our shrinking life expectancy. The disease we’re forgetting COVID doesn’t seem that scary anymore. More than 98 percent of the U.S. population has some degree of immunity — from vaccination, prior infection or both — and Paxlovid and other medications are available to counteract acute symptoms. For many of us, contracting COVID is like having a bad ­upper respiratory infection. But “COVID isn’t gone,” says Ryan Hurt, M.D., director of the Long COVID Research and Clinical Program at the Mayo Clinic. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that COVID still kills at least 1,000 people every week around the globe — but “we only have data from about 40 countries,” says Maria Van Kerkhove, M.D., director of WHO’s Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention. Older adults and those with preexisting conditions remain among the most at-risk populations for severe, acute COVID. ­People 65 and older accounted for 63 percent of COVID-related hospitalizations and 88 percent of in-hospital deaths during the first seven months of 2023, according to CDC data. Although the dangers of acute COVID ­infection may have ebbed for many, the ­reality of long COVID is coming into view. Of those who contracted COVID-19 within the past four years, 10 to 20 percent have experienced long COVID. “With every new case of acute COVID [the initial phase of infection when diagnosed or symptoms first appear], there is risk for developing long COVID,” says Caitlin McAuley, D.O., a family physician at the Keck COVID Recovery Clinic in Los Angeles. She’s had patients who developed long COVID fully recover, get reinfected several times with no lingering effects, then develop another case that leads to a new bout of long COVID. She’s also seen patients who got COVID twice with no lingering effects, and the third time they ended up with prolonged symptoms. “We still have a number of individuals who had the first wave of COVID who are suffering from long COVID symptoms now, several of them many years out,” says Jerrold Kaplan, M.D., medical director of the COVID Rehabilitation and Recovery Program at Gaylord Specialty Healthcare in Connecticut. Having escaped long COVID previously doesn’t mean you won’t face it in the future. Indeed, some research has suggested that catching multiple COVID-19 strains puts you at increased risk. A study published in 2022 found that reinfection can increase the risk of complications in major organ systems, and these risks persist at least six months beyond the initial infection. We don’t yet know the true impact of catching COVID. “Many chronic disease processes, such as cardiovascular disease, dementia and cancer, take years to develop. And whether acute COVID-19 puts people at risk for some of these issues? Time will tell,” Hurt says. What doctors do know is that patients are flocking to their offices complaining of symptoms they never had before COVID. Is long COVID boosting our death rate? In July, COVID accounted for less than 1 ­percent of all deaths in the U.S. Life expectancy in the U.S. is 77.5 years, reflecting an uptick over the past two years but still lower than prepandemic levels. Many factors contribute to that statistic, but it’s clear that the long-term effects of COVID have played a role. For example, a study in the journal Nature Medicine found that those hospitalized with COVID had a 29 percent greater risk of death in the three years after their infection. “But what was also alarming is that in people who weren’t hospitalized, there was also an increased risk of a variety of medical issues,” says John Baratta, founder and codirector of the COVID Recovery Clinic at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Even patients who’d had mild bouts of COVID-19 had an increased risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological issues lingering for three years after the initial infection. Long COVID patients had a significantly increased risk of severe health issues affecting the brain, lungs and heart. We have long known that an acute case of COVID can compromise heart health: Compared with those who didn’t contract COVID, people who caught the virus were 81 percent more likely to die of a cardiovascular complication in the ensuing three weeks, according to a study of 160,000 patients published by the European Society of Cardiology. But the risk lingers long after the symptoms abate. Those who caught the virus were five times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease as long as 18 months after infection, the same study found. Heart disease deaths, which had been on a downward trend for decades, began to spike in 2020 and remained high through 2022, the last year for which data is available. Stroke, blood clots in the legs leading to clots in the lungs, abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and inflammation of the heart are among the challenges COVID poses, says Mohanakrishnan Sathyamoorthy, M.D., professor and chair of internal medicine at the Burnett School of Medicine in Fort Worth, Texas. In long COVID, this collection of cardiovascular disruptions can present as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), in which patients’ heart rates increase abnormally when they go from sitting or ­lying down to standing up. One theory to explain COVID’s long-term effect on the heart — and the body in general — centers on inflammation. “Every time you get infected with COVID, there is a possible increased risk of long COVID, and some cardiac disorders can occur — especially if you have a history of heart disease, including stroke, heart disease and heart attacks,” says Pragna Patel, M.D., senior adviser for long COVID at the CDC. All of these problems can be exacerbated by the virus entering coronary tissue and triggering inflammatory responses that can damage the heart. Researchers say COVID may also alter the gut microbiome, a primary controller of inflammation, thereby triggering the immune system to rev up the condition. “There is no single agreed-upon mechanism that’s causing the issues,” Baratta says. “An individual may have multiple factors going on in their body, and not everyone will have the same underlying mechanism causing their symptoms,” which increases the complexity of both research and treatment. One factor that seems to matter: vaccination status. “Several studies show that vaccination can decrease the risk of developing long COVID,” Patel says. Vaccination rates tend to increase with age, with people 75 and older being the most well vaccinated — hence the most well protected from long COVID, Patel theorizes. That may explain why long COVID most commonly affects people ages 35 to 64; the risk seems to drop for those 65-plus, according to CDC data. From long covid diagnosis to treatment No single test can determine whether a ­person has long COVID. Doctors typically diagnose long COVID by reviewing the ­patient’s health history and current symptoms and trying to rule out other causes. A positive COVID test is not required, as someone could have been infected without knowing it, then experience strange symptoms later, Patel says. Though there are many ongoing clinical trials on long COVID, there is no umbrella treatment. Primary care physicians address what they can, then call in specialists — such as a cardiologist to handle arrhythmia or a therapist to treat anxiety — for more targeted care. There are long COVID centers around the country where teams of professionals work to help patients through their unique symptoms. “Because the effects of COVID are so wide throughout the body and mind, there will not be a single treatment for all long COVID issues,” Baratta says. “This is ­going to be treated by many different types of providers and specialists, and it will be treated, often, symptom by symptom.” Long COVID is recognized as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act if it substantially limits one or more major life activities. About 200 symptoms fall ­under that umbrella, Patel says. Here are some of the conditions we’re learning can linger months and, in some cases, years beyond an acute COVID infection. If these or other health changes seem familiar, consult your primary care physician. 1. Extreme fatigue It’s common to experience fatigue when your body is busy fighting off an illness. But some people still struggle with fatigue long after their initial COVID infection. In fact, a lack of energy is the number one symptom reported by long COVID patients. In some, this can be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome, which has been on the rise since the start of the pandemic, Baratta says. He defines this as “a disabling level of fatigue that severely limits daily activities.” This lingering fatigue may be due to limited production of energy within the muscles caused by damage to the mitochondria from a COVID infection. It can happen to anyone — no matter their level of fitness before infection. “I’ve treated patients who have been triathletes and now may only be able to do 15 or 20 minutes of exercise a day, when they’re used to running and swimming miles at a time,” Kaplan says. He recommends starting slow and pacing yourself with everything you do around the house, “doing shorter intervals several times throughout the day, rather than trying to do everything at once.” Whether it gets better depends on the individual. Some people’s symptoms clear, and some people may battle them indefinitely. 2. Shortness of breath An analysis of chest CT scans from 144 patients ages 27 to 80 found that more than one-third of people hospitalized with a previous COVID infection had lung scarring and thickening two years after coming into contact with the virus. Even patients with milder cases who walked away without scarring can experience changes in their breathing. “Some research shows that people ­after COVID start to take shorter, shallower breaths,” Baratta says. “This essentially causes a type of hyperventilation they are doing without even recognizing it, not getting good fresh air deep into the lungs, and [this] can lead to shortness of breath.” ​ Doctors have found success using respiratory exercises to help patients relearn slow, deep breathing. 3. Cognitive changes Difficulty concentrating, spaciness and forgetfulness are just a few of the brain challenges COVID can bring on. These can last for weeks or months or — in some with long COVID — become an everyday occurrence that lasts indefinitely. COVID may linger in a person’s gut long after an infection, altering their microbiome and hindering the body’s ability to produce serotonin, leading to cognitive disturbances. COVID may also disrupt the blood-brain barrier, allowing chemicals or molecules in the rest of the body to enter the brain blood circulation and potentially lead to brain fog, Baratta says. One study found that 30 days after testing positive for COVID-19, people were at greater risk for cognitive decline, as well as for mental health disorders including anxiety, depression and stress. Another study found inflammation in the brains of people with mild to moderate COVID-19 was similar to the effects of seven years of aging. Doctors are leading neurologically affected patients through cognitive rehabilitation exercises that show promise in reducing symptoms. 4. Depression and anxiety “Mood-related disorders are one of the top five issues that happen to people after COVID,” Baratta says. There may be a direct relationship between the virus’s effect on the brain and mood issues. A 2021 review of eight studies found that 12 weeks after a COVID infection, 11 to 28 ­percent of people had depression symptoms, and 3 to 12 percent of those individuals reported their symptoms as severe. If you’re feeling more stressed or down after catching COVID, tell your primary care physician, who can refer you to a therapist. Or visit the American Psychological Association’s search tool at locator.apa.org to find a qualified therapist in your area. 5. Sleep disturbances Nearly 40 percent of people with long COVID have reported major changes to their sleep patterns. One study looked at 1,056 COVID-19 patients who did not have a severe enough infection to require hospitalization. Of that population, 76.1 percent reported having insomnia and 22.8 percent severe insomnia. Sleep ­apnea may also appear post-COVID, another way the disease affects the respiratory system. Talk to your doctor if you’re having sleep issues. A CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine can help with sleep ­apnea. Lifestyle habits that prioritize healthy sleep, such as keeping consistent sleep and wake times and avoiding large meals before bed, may also help. “Post-COVID sleep has literally been a nightmare! We saw a 23 percent increase in sleeping-pill prescription during and post-COVID,” says Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist and clinical sleep specialist in Los Angeles. 6. Digestive upset Diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating and gas: These symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome can be by-products of an encounter with COVID. A survey of 729 COVID survivors found that 29 percent experienced at least one new chronic GI symptom six months after their infection. “There is evidence that parts of the COVID virus linger in the GI tract for many months after the initial illness, and it’s been suggested that the presence of these ongoing viral fragments causes dysfunction or problems with the GI tract, leading to mostly symptoms of diarrhea and gastric distress and discomfort,” Baratta says. Talk to your doctor about any new digestive symptoms or seek help from a gastro­enterologist. You can keep a food journal and note if your condition flares after eating certain foods. Try cutting out those foods, then reintroducing them one by one to see what you react to, Kaplan advises. 7. New or worsened allergies Some people who develop COVID experience allergies they never had before. One study found the risk of ­developing allergic diseases, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, rose significantly within the first 30 days after a COVID diagnosis. This may be because one’s immune system stays hypervigilant after fighting the virus, McAuley says. In severe cases, like Chrissy Bernal’s, this can lead to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a disease that can behave like a series of severe allergies: The body’s cells become hypersensitive, causing strong ­reactions to everything from food and pollen to even a hot shower or exercise. Antihistamines and other medications may help, so talk to your doctor if you experience skin itching, a rapid pulse, wheezing or gastro­intestinal symptoms. 8. Pain Some COVID survivors battle chronic pain, everything from aching joints to testicular pain. There is a higher risk of inflammatory arthritis, and women are at higher risk than men. One review of studies estimated that 10 percent of people who contracted COVID experienced musculo­skeletal pain at some point during the first year after infection. Reducing stress, eating a healthy diet and exercising may ease some post-COVID ­discomfort. Massage therapy, movement therapy, acupuncture and over-the-counter pain medications may also offer relief. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist, such as a rheumatologist, who can help manage symptoms including joint pain. Fast-moving research means new hope If your symptoms last after a bout of COVID, start with your primary care physician, who can help treat your symptoms or refer you to a specialist. Despite previous dismissals, long COVID is more recognized these days, Patel says, and the CDC is doing its part to educate both patients and providers. And initiatives such as the National Institutes of Health’s Recover program are researching treatment options. “In a year, things will look different, because research is moving so quickly,” says Sara F. Martin, M.D., medical director of the Adult Post-Acute COVID Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The CDC, for instance, is funding a series of clinical trials that the NIH has in the works. This new information, Martin says, may guide doctors, including herself, who treat long COVID ­patients to better ease their symptoms.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing that phenylephrine, a common decongestant found in many over-the-counter cold medications, be removed from these products. The proposal, issued Nov. 7, comes roughly a year after an advisory panel of experts concluded the ingredient is ineffective at relieving nasal congestion when taken by mouth﻿. “It is the FDA’s role to ensure that drugs are safe and effective,” Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant.” Phenylephrine is supposed to work by reducing swelling of the blood vessels in the nasal passages, making it easier to breathe. But when taken orally, “it basically becomes deactivated before it ﻿enters your bloodstream,” says Stefanie Ferreri, a professor of pharmacy at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy. “It’s almost like a placebo, a sugar pill, when it’s taken orally.” Experts stress that phenylephrine, which has been sold for decades, isn’t dangerous, and it is still effective when used as a nasal spray or as drops to dilate the eyes. Common Decongestants ﻿That Won’t Work Here are examples of oral medications that may help your headache or sore throat, but they won’t relieve your stuffy nose. Advil Sinus Congestion & Pain Tylenol Cold + Head Congestion Severe Mucinex Sinus-Max Severe Congestion & Pain Relief Benadryl Allergy Plus Congestion DayQuil Cold + Flu Sudafed PE Theraflu Severe Cold Relief Daytime Vicks Sinex Severe This list is not exhaustive. Phenylephrine is found in a number of oral over-the-counter products. But it can be harmful to your wallet if you’re buying a pill that’s ineffective to relieve congestion, Ferreri says. Products containing phenylephrine — including those sold by big brands such as Tylenol, Advil, Sudafed and Mucinex — generated nearly $1.8 billion in sales in 202﻿2, according to data presented by the advisory panel in 2023. What works and what doesn’t for a stuffy nose﻿ Phenylephrine, sometimes labeled PE on ﻿packaging﻿,﻿ is sold on its own but is often found in combination products that contain ingredients meant to knock out a range of symptoms that can accompany congestion — sore throat, fever, body aches and so on. Because of this, you may not want to toss out everything containing phenylephrine, says Sarah Westberg, a professor at the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy. That box of cold and flu medication could help with your other symptoms, it just won’t unclog your nose. If you’re looking for a decongestant that will work, there are options — just be sure to talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking one, especially if you take other medications, experts stress. Nearly half of older adults take at least five drugs daily. Common Decongestants ﻿That Won’t Work Here are examples of oral medications that may help your headache or sore throat, but they won’t relieve your stuffy nose.

Phenylephrine is found in a number of oral over-the-counter products. Pseudoephedrine is an effective oral alternative, Westberg says. It’s available without a prescription, but it’s not as easy to buy as phenylephrine since pseudoephedrine can be used to illegally make methamphetamine, a stimulant that can be highly addic﻿tive. It’s technically behind the counter, so you’ll need to ask the pharmacist for a product containing pseudoephedrine and will only be able to purchase a limited amount at one time. “You can still get enough ﻿to treat your cough and cold,” Ferreri says. Just know that pseudoephedrine can cause an increase in blood pressure, so it’s important to talk to your doctor before taking it if you have high blood pressure or heart disease. About 70 percent of adults 65 and older have high blood pressure. Another option: “Go straight to the source” and consider a nasal spray, Ferreri says. A spray product containing phenylephrine will work fine when it comes to relieving congestion, though this can similarly affect your blood pressure. Saline nasal sprays that don’t contain medication can also provide relief. “Consumers should know that a range of safe and effective drugs and other treatments is available to temporarily relieve congestion symptoms due to allergies or a common cold,” Theresa Michele, M.D., director of the FDA’s Office of Nonprescription Drug Products, said in a statement. “Consumers can also talk to their doctor or pharmacist about ways to treat these symptoms.” The decongestant aisle could shrink The FDA's order is just a proposal; only a final order will affect what products can be marketed, the agency says. If the FDA removes phenylephrine from over-the-counter medications, it could “have a big impact on the market,” Westberg says. “There are a lot of ﻿products that will need to be reformulated.” (The FDA said it will give companies “appropriate time” to do this.) That’s not a bad thing, though, Ferreri says. “Right now, I think we have way too many [options] on the market﻿, and it’s almost confusing. You want to have things on the market that are safe and effective, and [we need to] narrow it down so you know what you’re buying is going to work,” she says.

Here’s how to stay safe By Rachel Nania, Updated June 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published July 26, 2022 / Updated June 17, 2024 Getty Images It’s not your imagination: It really is hotter than when you were a kid. In fact, 2023 was the hottest year on record since 1850, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And the nine years from 2014 to 2022 round out the top 10 warmest. Climate experts warn that bouts of extreme heat are going to become more common as global temperatures continue to rise. That’s bad news for the growing population of older adults, who are more likely to get sick from heat — even die from it. In 2023, soaring temps sent nearly 120,000 people in the U.S. to emergency rooms, a 2024 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. Heat-related deaths have been increasing in recent years, with approximately 2,302 occurring in 2023, up from 1,722 in 2022, according to federal data, though other research suggests the number is much higher. A study published in 2020 in the journal Environmental Epidemiology finds an average of 5,608 deaths are attributable to heat each year. A study from a team of Duke University researchers estimates that 12,000 Americans die annually from heat-related causes. Regardless of the total tally, most people who die from the heat are over the age of﻿ 50, the National Institute on Aging says. “It has everything to do with our body’s ability to deal with heat as we age,” Aaron Bernstein, M.D., told AARP in 2022, when he was the interim director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Bernstein is now the director of the National Center for Environmental Health and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry at the CDC. “People who are older, our bodies may not be able to dissipate heat as well as people who are younger. We also tend to have more chronic health problems and may take more medications that affect our body’s ability to deal with heat.” Here’s a closer look at why heat is such a health risk for older adults, and what you can do to stay safe as heat waves become more frequent. Cooling down the body becomes harder People get into trouble when they can’t cool themselves down. That’s when heat exhaustion can occur, often marked by dizziness, fatigue and a weak, rapid pulse. If that goes untreated, heatstroke can set in, bringing with it the potential for long-term organ damage or death. Sweating is the top way that humans cool themselves, Bernstein says. It’s not the sweat itself that is particularly cooling but rather the evaporation process. It takes energy to evaporate sweat off the skin, and the energy source in this equation is heat. So as sweat switches from liquid to vapor, heat leaves your body and you start to cool down. At-risk adults on the rise Temperatures are increasing and so is the aging population. By 2050, roughly 200 million more older adults worldwide are expected to face exposure to dangerous heat, compared with now, research published in Nature Communications suggests. “The effects are projected to be the most severe in Asia and Africa, which may also have the lowest adaptive capacities,” Deborah Carr, professor of sociology at Boston University and a coauthor of the study, said in a statement. Sweat glands become less effective with age. “They can’t pump out as much sweat as quickly,” Daniel Van Durme, M.D., former chief medical officer at the Florida State University College of Medicine, told AARP. ﻿ What’s more, several medications common among older adults can interfere with how efficiently the body sweats or handles heat, Van Durme said, including some antihistamines (to ease allergy symptoms) and drugs used to treat overactive bladder. Certain antidepressants and some blood pressure medicines can also hinder the body’s ability to cool itself — and experts say there are likely many more that inflict this effect. Another disadvantage for older adults is heat’s impact on the heart. Hand in hand with sweating, the body releases heat by increasing blood flow to the skin to push the heat away from the core. This requires the heart to work harder. “And if you have heart disease, that puts strain on an already potentially weak heart,” Bernstein says. “So you see people during heat events having heart attacks, arrhythmias, strokes — there’s a big risk for that.” At-risk adults on the rise Temperatures are increasing and so is the aging population. By 2050, roughly 200 million more older adults worldwide are expected to face exposure to dangerous heat, compared with now, research published in Nature Communications suggests. “The effects are projected to be the most severe in Asia and Africa, which may also have the lowest adaptive capacities,” Deborah Carr, professor of sociology at Boston University and a coauthor of the study, said in a statement. More than 20 million adults in the U.S. have the most common type of heart disease, federal statistics show, and its prevalence increases with age. Nearly half of U.S. adults are affected by diseases of the heart and blood vessels, the American Heart Association reports. A study published in 2023 in the journal Circulation found that the risk of a fatal heart attack among older adults in Jiangsu province, China, was higher during two- and four-day heat waves. The most dangerous days were those of extreme heat and high levels of air pollution, including pollution from wildfires. The researchers estimated that up to 2.8 percent of heart attack deaths may be attributed to the combination. Dehydration amps up the danger Hydration plays a major role when it comes to staying healthy in extreme heat. You need fluid to produce the sweat that cools you down; it’s also essential to keeping the cells functioning and the organs running. Older adults have a harder time staying hydrated, mostly because of a decreased sense of thirst that sets in as you age, says Eric De Jonge, M.D., director of geriatrics at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. Certain medications that draw fluid from the body — including diuretics, used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, and laxatives — can further complicate matters. When you’re dehydrated, the kidneys “can spiral into dysfunction,” kicking off a domino effect of destruction throughout the body, Bernstein says. Dehydration is especially risky for the nearly 40 percent of U.S. adults 65 and older who already have kidney disease. Bernstein urges caution among those who routinely take medications that are hard on the kidneys, including over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen. In addition to kidney disease, another chronic condition that can be worsened by dehydration is diabetes, which the CDC says affects an estimated 29 percent of U.S. adults 65 and older and roughly 19 percent of those ages 45 to 64. Blood sugar becomes more concentrated when there’s less water in the body, the CDC explains, and it becomes “incredibly difficult” to manage blood sugar levels, Bernstein says. Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration Even the brain feels heat’s effects: The part that’s responsible for long-term planning “goes on vacation,” Bernstein says, “and the part of your brain that is in crisis mode is calling the shots.” Judgment can become impaired, and injuries may ensue. To stay safe, make a plan for high-heat days The list of health complications that can arise when temperatures rise seems never-ending — add to it that hot air can aggravate the lungs and trigger breathing issues, even in people who aren’t prone to respiratory distress — but experts say a little planning can go a long way when it comes to staying safe during summer. Here’s what you can do: Check the heat forecast. New this year, the CDC has a dashboard that can show you the heat risk in your community. Just type in your ZIP code, and check the forecast. Pay attention to humidity. There isn’t a single temperature at which things get dangerous, experts say — so much depends on what an individual is used to and how their body acclimates to heat. But one thing that can ramp up the danger is humidity, since sweat, the body’s cooling mechanism, “doesn’t want to evaporate into air that’s got a lot of water in it already,” Bernstein says. Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration As a rule of thumb, “85 [degrees] and humid is when we start to really think a lot and talk to our patients and families a lot about preventive measures,” De Jonge says. Talk to your doctor about your medications. If you take a medication that can affect how your body deals with heat, don’t stop taking it just because high temperatures are on the horizon. “The dangers of stopping may be far worse,” Van Durme warned. Instead, take extra caution in the heat, he says. Your doctor may decide to switch up your medications during the warmer months. Drink past the point of thirst — and get creative with hydration. Don’t use thirst as your guide for hydration because “by the time you feel thirsty, you are already significantly dehydrated,” Van Durme said. The color of your urine is a good indicator of whether you’re well hydrated. Thumbs-up if it’s a pale yellow; bottoms up if it’s dark yellow or orange, De Jonge says. That’s a sign you need to keep drinking — just not alcohol or caffeine. You don’t have to limit yourself to water. Cold fruit — think watermelon and cantaloupe — can boost your hydration levels. Mixing in fruit juice can keep things more interesting for people who get tired of plain water. Have a fan handy. If you don’t have air-conditioning — or even if you do — fans can keep you cool by helping sweat to quickly evaporate from the body. But when the temperature is above a certain level, they’re not very helpful. “When the temperature is hotter outside than in our bodies, fans work like a convection oven; we’re actually blowing heat in,” Bernstein says. A cool shower or bath is another way to cool off at home when things get too warm. Pay attention to your thermostat. If you have a chronic health condition that could put you at higher risk for heat-related illness and the temperature in your home is over 80 degrees, “you need to do something,” Bernstein says. That might mean turning on a fan, relocating to a cooler level in your home or building, or going to an air-conditioned space, even if it’s a neighbor’s house. Know your cooling centers. Many communities set up centers during heat waves to provide a safe space for people to cool down. Identify the closest one, and plan how to get there if you need to use it. If you have pets, check to see whether they’re welcome, says Diane Garcia-Gonzales, a research scientist with the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was part of a team that created community heat maps so state residents can stay informed about heat events in their areas. Don’t forget about other air-conditioned spaces — a church, a library, even a trip to the grocery store or the mall can provide relief. Have a backup plan. It’s always good to have a plan in place in case your air-conditioning goes out or your electricity fizzles and your home starts to heat up, Garcia-Gonzales says. Of course, this depends on whether the issue is widespread. If it’s limited, identify a place where you know you and the members of your household can stay cool. If your air-conditioning goes out during a hot stretch, don’t try to wait out the wave before getting it fixed. Know the warning signs of heat illness — and what to do. Watch out for confusion and slurred speech. Neurological issues mean you need to get to an emergency room. “That’s the one that you don’t want to mess with,” Van Durme said. If someone just needs to sit down — maybe gets a little woozy but is able to carry on a conversation — get them to cool off by moving them into an air-conditioned place or positioning them near a fan. And get them to drink. Another thing: Pay attention to others around you. If you’re at an event or gathering and one person goes down from the heat, “then everybody’s at risk,” Van Durme said. Check in on others. Finally, if you have a neighbor, friend or family member who’s at higher risk for heat-related illness, check in on them when things get warm to make sure they’re keeping up their fluids and staying cool and comfortable. “There’s no substitute for the human, in-person daily visits,” De Jonge says. Heat Exhaustion Vs. Heat Stroke Getting overheated can be dangerous. Keep an eye out for these warning signs. Heat exhaustion: Feeling faint or dizzy Excessive sweating Cool, pale, clammy skin Nausea or vomiting Rapid, weak pulse Muscle cramps If you experience these symptoms, get to an air-conditioned space, drink water and take a cool shower or use a cool compress.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/flu-symptoms/,"Your Guide to the 2023-2024 Flu Season View Series How to Spot Serious Flu Symptoms​ Some can be atypical in older adults. Spotting them can be key to getting an effective antiviral Rx By Kimberly Goad, Updated February 14, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published September 10, 2021 / Updated February 14, 2025 Getty Images Fever. Fatigue. Muscle aches. A cough. With several respiratory illnesses circulating, it can be hard to know what exactly these symptoms point to. One major clue that you could have the flu: They came on abruptly (while those associated with COVID-19, for example, tend to start out mild and gradually worsen). ﻿ But that’s not to say the flu always announces itself in the regular way — particularly among people over 65. In a study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, older patients were less likely than younger ones to report fever, cough and sore throat — arguably the most common flu symptoms — and as a result, weren’t diagnosed as quickly, if at all. That can be problematic if you’re 65 and older, since age alone ups your chances of getting hit much harder by a bout with the flu.﻿ Blame your immune system, which weakens with age, “so all infections are more severe, as are complications from infections,” says infectious disease specialist Purvi Parikh, M.D., a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “Those over 65 may also have other chronic medical problems like heart disease and diabetes that make it even harder to fight off infections."" That explains why 70 to 85 percent of seasonal-flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 and older; and 50 to 70 percent of seasonal-flu-related hospitalizations have happened among older adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ﻿ “There’s always been clear knowledge that people over 65 are at an increased risk of severe complications from influenza, and hospitalization or death,” says Paul Auwaerter, M.D., clinical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases and professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ﻿ That’s why it’s important to get up to speed on flu symptoms and see your doctor if you have any or all of the following, especially if you have a medical condition such as heart disease or diabetes. 1. Fever All kinds of things can make your body temperature venture north or south of the well-known benchmark of 98.6 F. For instance, it can go up when you exercise and down when you sleep. But a fever of 100.4 F or more is “a sign your body is responding to something dangerous physically and is trying to mount an immune response,” says Auwaerter. ﻿ But a fever doesn’t have to get that high to cause complications in people over 65, he adds. Why? “People who are older may have less buffer in terms of handling fever and the infection may worsen more rapidly than it might in a younger person,” he says. “Any fever in an elderly person is a red flag,” Auwaerter stresses, adding that you should call your doctor if you have a temperature over 100 F. If you’re under 65 and do not have any other risk factors, you might have uncomplicated influenza, he says, which could respond well to over-the-counter therapies and supportive care. Keep in mind: Just because you aren’t running a temperature doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. You can have the flu without having a fever. 2. Trouble breathing You’re short of breath and all you’ve done is walk to the mailbox and back. Or maybe you’re having trouble completing a sentence without stopping to catch your breath. A family member may even have noticed you’re breathing faster than normal. If you have the flu, all of these can be a red flag that your condition has become serious. “When you’re not getting enough oxygen, the body sends out signals to breathe fast in an effort to increase oxygen levels and adrenaline levels to make the body respond to a relative state of not acquiring enough oxygen that’s demanded by the body,” explains Auwaerter. “If you’re feeling short of breath, if you’re turning blue, if you’re confused — all of these should prompt calling emergency medical services.” 3. Dehydration Staying hydrated is always important. If your body isn’t getting enough fluids, it can’t function as it should. And yet research suggests 17 to 28 percent of older adults in the U.S. are dehydrated for any number of reasons. Not only is it a frequent cause of hospitalization, it can also complicate various medical conditions. There are a number of ways the flu can make it difficult to stay hydrated. If you’re running a fever, vomiting or have diarrhea, it’s easy to become dehydrated, notes Auwaerter. “Breathing faster than normal also causes water losses.” That’s why getting plenty of fluids (water, broth, sports drinks) is critical to avoiding complications from the flu. Just don’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink. Although mild fluid loss can usually be treated at home, severe dehydration must be treated in the hospital, according to the CDC. Some signs you’re dehydrated: Besides extreme thirst, look for fatigue, dizziness, confusion, a fast-beating heart, dry eyes and dark-colored urine. “I tell people to drink enough so they’re going to the bathroom regularly and their urine is light-colored to clear,” says Auwaerter. If you have heart failure or kidney disease, check with your doctor about safe amounts of liquid. ﻿ And don’t forget: Alcohol and caffeinated drinks aren’t fluids you should be reaching for when you’ve got the flu. These act as a diuretic, just the opposite of what you should be consuming when you’re trying to stay hydrated. 4. Dizziness or confusion Getting Early Treatment With Antivirals When it comes to treating the flu, time is of the essence. You typically have two days from the onset of symptoms to start taking an antiviral drug — a type of prescription medicine that keeps the flu virus from replicating in your body. Antiviral treatment can be the difference between having a milder case of the flu versus a more serious bout. Some studies have reported that when used early enough, it can reduce the risk of death for adults hospitalized with the flu.﻿ “Anyone who thinks they have influenza should call their doctor, because early treatment is paramount to getting better, and there’s a limited window after onset of symptoms for antivirals to work,” says Auwaerter of Johns Hopkins. “Patients with risk factors or progressive symptoms of influenza have a longer period for which antiviral medicines may have some impact, even three to four days into their illness,” he adds. But sooner is better “to avoid severe illness or hospitalization.” Your doctor will take into account your overall health when prescribing one of the four antivirals recommended by the CDC to treat the flu: oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) One of the oldest antivirals on the market, this is taken as a pill or liquid suspension and is also available as an equally effective, and often cheaper, generic medicine. Clinical trials have proven that this drug works to relieve flu symptoms. zanamivir (Relenza) Taken through an inhaler device, this drug isn’t recommended for people with breathing problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. peramivir (Rapivab) Given intravenously, this antiviral is used for hospitalized patients. baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) One of the newest antivirals available, it can be taken as a single dose (as opposed to Tamiflu, which is taken over several days). Given its side effects, however, this medication is not recommended for people with other illnesses, or those whose immune systems are severely compromised. When you have the flu or another infection like COVID-19, a sudden and significant change in health status should be considered a red flag. ﻿You should contact your doctor right away or go to the emergency room if they occur during a bout with respiratory illness, says Waleed Javaid, M.D., director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown and professor of medicine, infectious diseases, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “Persistent dizziness or confusion could be a sign of severe illness, dehydration or lack of oxygen,” he notes.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/bad-habits-for-eyes/,"The 9 Worst Habits for Your Eyes Everyday actions that can affect your vision and threaten your health By Kimberly Goad, Updated February 19, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published December 16, 2021 / Updated February 19, 2025 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (7)) The importance of an annual eye exam cannot be overstated. Not only does it help you keep tabs on any changes in your vision, but it’s a must for detecting the big vision thieves: glaucoma, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), all of which can cause irreparable harm before you’ve even noticed any vision loss, says Michelle Andreoli, M.D., an ophthalmologist at Northwestern Medicine and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. What might not be so obvious when it comes to the health of your eyes are the everyday habits that affect them. Here are nine of the worst habits for eyes — and what you can do to break each of them. Bad ﻿habit 1: Smoking Add this to the always-growing list of reasons to give up smoking for good: Cigarette smoke is more than just irritating to your eyes; research shows it also raises your risk of developing AMD, the eye disease that can blur your central vision. People over age 55 are already at risk for the condition, but a large review of studies published in Clinical Interventions in Aging shows that smokers﻿ are at a twofold to fourfold risk of AMD, as compared to never smokers. ​​“Smoking reduces the effectiveness of antioxidants and may deplete these levels in the macula,” the small area at the center of the retina that’s necessary to see things in front of you, explains Ashley Brissette, M.D., an ophthalmologist and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. ﻿“﻿Cigarette smoke also reduces the amount of oxygen reaching the tiny blood vessels that supply the eye, leading to vision damage.” That’s true for those who smoke only occasionally or are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, Brissette adds.﻿﻿ The good news? The same review of studies shows that kicking the habit not only reduces the risk of AMD, but after 20 years, the risk of developing the condition is the same as it is for nonsmokers﻿. ﻿Bad ﻿habit 2: Staring at your smartphone Your eyes pay a price directly and indirectly when you stare at that tiny screen — or, for that matter, your computer screen or TV — without giving them a break. According to the American Optometric Association, using any of your digital devices continuously for two hours is enough to bring about digital eye strain. “The two biggest concerns with onscreen habits boil down to chronic dry eye symptoms and disruption of natural sleep patterns,” Andreoli says. “We’re supposed to blink once every 4 seconds, and in front of the computer, we blink about once every 8 to 10 seconds. That [difference] may sound insignificant, but blinking is what keeps our eyes lubricated. [If] we aren’t lubricating our eyes sufficiently, we develop dry eye symptoms, and that leads to eye strain.” ​​Then there’s the toll too much screen time takes on our sleep patterns. “The brightness of the screen and the activity tells our brain it’s daytime, so we have a tendency not to get appropriately tired,” Andreoli says. Her recommendation: Practice the 20-20-20 rule. Throughout the day, take a 20-second screen break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away. And while you’re in the habit-changing mode, turn off your phone and put the laptop away in the hours leading up to bedtime. If you like to play, say, Wordle or return emails late at night, be sure to dim the screen﻿’s brightness. You can schedule this to happen automatically using the Night Shift setting on an iPhone or Notification Shade on an Android. ​ Bad habit 3: Not wearing sunglasses In the same way that ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can do a number on ﻿your skin, it can also wreak havoc with your vision. Specifically, UV rays can damage the eye’s surface tissues, the cornea and lens. And over time, that damage can lead to cataracts, AMD and cancers of the eye. “You can also develop a sunburn on the eyes called photokeratitis, which can be extremely painful,” Brissette says. To help prevent all of the above, wear sunglasses — and not just during the summer but every day of the year, even when it’s cloudy. ​​“Sunglasses protect the eyes in a few ways,” Brissette adds. “It’s hard to apply sunscreen close to the eyes, so sunglasses can act as a physical barrier, blocking UV rays from the eyelids and skin around the eyes. Also, the lenses of the sunglasses have UV protection.” To fully protect your eyes, check the tag or sticker to make sure the glasses provide 100 percent UV protection. “Some labels say, ‘UV absorption up to 400﻿ nm,’ which is the same as 100 percent UV protection,” Brissette says. ​​﻿ Worth noting: Even if you wear contact lenses with UV-blocking technology, you should still wear sunglasses outdoors. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, these contacts protect only the part of the eye they cover, leaving the outside of the eye exposed to harmful radiation. Your e﻿yes get the most protection when you wear sunglasses, especially wraparound styles. Bad habit 4: Sleeping in your contact lenses Sure, contacts have gotten more user﻿-friendly, but that doesn’t mean you can simply put them in and forget about them﻿. “The biggest issue is the risk of infection, which can cause permanent scarring of the cornea and loss of vision,” Brissette says. “Bacteria and other debris get trapped between the contact lens and the surface of the cornea, so leaving them in too long or past their expiration [puts you at] high risk for developing an infection.” About 1 in 3 contact lens wearers plead guilty to sleeping or napping in their lenses, according to research in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In doing so, they’re upping the risk for contact lens–related eye infections by six- to eight﻿fold. “They’ve come a long way in the last few decades, but the safety profile of contacts is dependent on not sleeping in them, swimming in them or showering in them — ever,” Andreoli says.﻿﻿ “I suggest daily lenses for most of my patients — put them in in the morning and throw them away at night — because the risk for infection with those types of lenses is very low. With some of the longer-wear lenses, patients have a knack for losing track of how long they’ve worn them. That can cause trouble over time.” ​​ Bad habit 5: Rubbing your eyes There’s no real harm in occasionally rubbing your eyes, but if you’re aggressive about it, you run the risk of damaging your cornea, the clear, dome-shaped front surface of your eye. “Some uncommon diseases of the cornea are associated with eye rubbing,” Andreoli says. Those include keratoconus, a condition that occurs when your cornea thins out and begins to bulge outward into a cone shape. As a result, your vision is blurry and distorted.﻿ ﻿ A study published recently in the Journal of Clinical Medicine found that the severity of dry eye disease was higher in patients who are chronic eye rubbers. If you’re looking for quick relief from redness, irritation, dryness and grittiness in the eye, it’s ﻿OK to rub your eyes. “The occasional rub will milk some tears out of the tear gland, but try not to be overly aggressive or frequent,” Andreoli adds. Better yet, reach for some lubricating eye drops or place a hot washcloth over your eyes. ​​ ​​If you find that you’re habitually rubbing your eyes — and one way to get a handle on just how often you’re rubbing is to keep track for a week — try rubbing the outer edge of the eye socket instead of your eyes as a way to minimize the consequences. If that doesn’t work, then seeing a therapist may help. Bad habit 6: Sleeping with your makeup on Researchers have known for a while that wearing eye makeup increases your risk of inflammation and affects the quality of your tears. It also plays a role in the development and/or exacerbation of dry eye disease, according to research published in 2022 in the journal Cureus. That’s especially true if you make a habit of falling asleep with your makeup on. Every once in a great while, it’s OK if you don’t take your makeup off before you fall asleep. Make a habit of it, however, and you raise your risk of eye infection﻿, most notably in the form of a sty, a painful lump that grows from the base of your eyelash or under the eyelid. Also important: how you take off your eye makeup. “Oil-based remover can exacerbate some dry ﻿eye symptoms because they deposit a ton of oil in the tears,” Andreoli says. “If patients are starting to notice this, abandon eye makeup remover and use very mild face soap instead.” Bad habit 7: Heavy drinking The surprise isn’t that drinking more than the recommended amount of alcohol — up to one drink per day for women and no more than two per day for men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — is bad for your health.﻿ The surprise is how bad heavy drinking can be﻿﻿ for your eyes. “Some of the most damaging effects on vision are from extremely high levels of alcohol or chronic alcohol abuse,” Brissette says. “Toxic blood alcohol levels can permanently damage the optic nerve and vision centers.” In fact, a review of studies published in 2021 in the Journal of Ophthalmic & Vision Research found that chronic alcohol consumption raises the risk for cataracts, AMD, diabetic retinopathy and various types of optic neuropathy, among other conditions. Social drinkers, take note: None of the above applies to you. But that doesn’t mean you’re totally in the clear. Even occasional alcohol use contributes to dry eye disease, Brissette says. ﻿ Bad habit 8: Skimping on nutrients Somewhere along the way, carrots became the poster vegetable for good eye health. While it’s true that your eyes need vitamin A — it helps nourish the cornea and is critical for the retina to function — the vitamin A-rich carrot is far from the only eye-friendly veggie. In the landmark Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and the follow-up AREDS2, researchers tested whether taking nutritional supplements — specifically, lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamins C and E, copper and zinc — could prevent or slow the progression of AMD and cataracts. The researchers found that taking the vitamins had no effect on cataracts, but it did help AMD patients reduce their risk of progressing from intermediate to advanced AMD by about 25 percent. The formulation tested in the study is now commonly sold over the counter as the AREDS2 formula. Brissette recommends taking the supplement if you’ve been diagnosed with AMD. Otherwise, she suggests following the Mediterranean diet for overall eye health. “That’s what we have the best evidence for in terms of being beneficial for eye health — specifically, foods rich in vitamins A, C and E, lutein, zeaxanthin and omegas,” she says. “It’s always better to get our nutrients from whole food sources rather than from supplements, if possible. If you’ve been diagnosed with macular degeneration, then taking a supplement, such as AREDS2, can help to slow progression and are additionally recommended.” Bad habit 9: Skipping vaccines The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends getting appropriate vaccines, including shingles and measles. Both diseases can cause serious vision problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone over age 50 get a two-course dose of Shingrix, which is 97 percent successful at preventing shingles in people in their 50s and 60s, and 91 percent successful for those in their 70s and older. In addition to a painful rash, shingles can cause serious complications﻿, including nerve damage and vision loss. Although most older Americans have either had measles or had the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, some recent outbreaks are causing concern. If you can’t remember if you﻿’ve had the illness or vaccine, talk to your doctor. Measles can infect the cornea and cause blindness, although due to widespread vaccination, this is rare in the United States. Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Women’s Health, Prevention, Health and Reader's Digest.","The article discusses the everyday habits that can negatively impact eye health, highlighting nine specific behaviors to avoid. The key findings include the risks associated with smoking, excessive screen time, not wearing sunglasses, and poor contact lens hygiene, among others. A novel insight is that certain habits, such as heavy drinking and skipping vaccines, can also have a significant impact on eye health, with heavy drinking linked to various eye conditions and vaccine-preventable diseases like shingles and measles potentially causing serious vision problems.

But there’s another highly contagious respiratory virus that spreads in the fall and winter months, and similar to the coronavirus and influenza, this bug can be downright dangerous for older adults. It’s called RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus. And while it’s commonly thought of as an illness that affects babies and young children, RSV sends as many as 160,000 U.S. adults ages 60-plus to the hospital each year, and kills as many as 10,000 older Americans annually, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Doctors and public health experts are hopeful that a suite of new RSV vaccines can help keep these numbers down this year. Health officials recommend that everyone 75 and older get an RSV vaccine﻿ if they didn’t get one when the shots first became available in 2023. The vaccine is also recommended for people 60 to 74 who have underlying health conditions, like chronic heart and lung disease. What are the symptoms of RSV? A mild infection RSV can be tricky to identify, since its symptoms tend to mirror those of other respiratory illnesses, including flu and COVID, says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. While infants and babies with RSV tend to display signs of lethargy, apnea (pauses in breathing) and loss of appetite, the infection in older adults can come with a runny nose, congestion, cough, fatigue, a mild headache and fever. Adults can also have a stuffy nose, sore throat and aches and pains, Schaffner says. ﻿7 Common RSV symptoms in older adults Congestion Cough Fever Lack of energy Mild headache Runny nose Sore throat Source: Cleveland Clinic When RSV turns severe While symptoms are usually mild in most, RSV can make some adults really sick, and older adults are at higher risk for complications from a respiratory virus, like RSV. So are individuals with heart and lung disease or a compromised immune system. RSV can cause lower respiratory infections like pneumonia and bronchitis, and it can worsen existing health conditions like asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and heart failure. ﻿7 Common RSV symptoms in older adults Congestion Cough Fever Lack of energy Mild headache Runny nose Sore throat Source: Cleveland Clinic According to Cleveland Clinic, some symptoms that signal an RSV infection is taking a turn for the worse include: Extreme tiredness or weaknessLow appetitePersistent coughWheezingShortness of breathBluish skin, lips or nailsSudden change in mental state Another clue is if your temperature continues to climb, Schaffner says, or if your cough starts to produce sputum (phlegm or mucus), which could indicate that “you’ve developed a complicating pneumonia.” If you notice any of these more serious symptoms, seek medical attention. Treating RSV symptoms Both flu and COVID-19 have prescription antiviral treatments that can help keep a mild infection from turning severe, but no such treatment exists for RSV, which is why Schaffer says prevention with the vaccine is crucial. If you have a mild infection, you can get relief from symptoms with over-the-counter medications. Ann Philbrick, a pharmacist and associate professor and director of community engagement in the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy, suggests a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to curb any aches and pains from the illness, though it’s always important to check with a doctor or pharmacist first to see which type is best for your needs. For the cough, she recommends guaifenesin (Mucinex) to help “loosen up the mucus.” Guaifenesin can appear in combination products with dextromethorphan, a cough suppressant, but Philbrick generally recommends steering clear of the latter ingredient. “Because typically when we have an infection, a cough is good to loosen things up and get things flowing through the body,” she says. “Where I do recommend dextromethorphan is if that cough is just keeping you up at night and you absolutely cannot sleep.” Again, before using be sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist. Pseudoephedrine can help with congestion, but the medication can also affect blood pressure. “So for patients that have blood pressure issues already, that’s something that I would certainly limit or just kind of stay away from,” Philbrick says. And don’t forget fluids, she adds; staying hydrated is key.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/water-aerobics/,"Is Water Aerobics Right for You? Aquatic exercise can relieve stress, ease achy joints, improve balance and even help you make friends By Barbara Sadick, AARP Comments En español Published August 15, 2023 Getty Images Aquatic exercise is a fun way to work out that doesn’t put pressure on bones, joints or muscles. Water creates natural resistance that supports the weight of the body and reduces impact on joints and muscles. Water exercise and therapy can also reduce intensity of pain, improve range of motion, build strength and generally improve the level of functioning in everyday life. “Water exercise can be a good alternative for those who can’t tolerate the stress of land-based exercise,” says Cari Utendorf, a physical therapist at the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center. “It allows people to exercise with little chance of injury.” Here are some situations in which it could benefit you and why. 1. You have joint problems If you have joint pain or stiffness, arthritis, backaches, achy knees or sore hips, aquatic exercise may not cure your symptoms, but it can give you temporary relief. The buoyancy of water lessens stress on your joints. Water slows movement and allows time to focus on posture and alignment, helps reduce inflammation and improves joint range of motion, all of which can reduce pain. Julie See, director of education at the Aquatic Exercise Association, says that when your body is immersed in water, the weight-bearing load to your joints is reduced. At mid-rib cage to mid-chest depth — the general recommendation for shallow water classes — the reduction is approximately 75 percent. Immersed to the shoulders, it’s reduced to almost 90 percent. At waist depth, weight bearing is reduced to about 50 percent. Simply adjusting the depth at which you exercise greatly influences your workout results. Michael Murray, president of the APTA Academy of Aquatic Physical Therapy and an aquatics specialist at Duke Health, says water therapy is helpful if you want to try to avoid surgery. It can also help you regain movement and motion after surgery. Because you’re lighter in water and your body can float, you’ll be able to exercise for longer than you can on land without hurting your joints. “After surgery, once a physician gives the go-ahead, aquatic therapy can help improve the range of motion of joints and increase the strength of muscles around those joints,” he says. 2. You have heart disease The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) a week of aerobic or heart-pumping physical activity such as running, walking and swimming to remain healthy. Water aerobics can be used simply to get exercise or as a form of therapy. Murray warns, though, that before starting cardiac aquatic exercise, you need to be sure your vital signs are stable, and your doctor has given you the go-ahead. Water exercise is therapeutic and fun, he says, but it can overload your heart if you have a condition that’s not being properly treated. See explains that aquatic exercise can be an aerobic activity that uses your heart and lungs effectively. Additionally, immersion in water helps the heart transport oxygen more efficiently to your working muscles. Research has found that the exercise heart rate during aquatic exercise is often lower than the heart rate during exercise of the same intensity on land. Even if you have a cardiac condition, water exercises can be tailored to your specific needs, Murray says. “You can begin with low levels of activity like walking in the water and work your way up to deep water running and swimming.” 3. You are stressed Exercise helps relieve stress, and water exercise is no exception. For most people, participating in water exercise and therapy can be a way to decompress. Exercise reduces your body’s level of stress hormones and stimulates the production of endorphins, chemicals in the brain that elevate your mood. ﻿“Incorporating diaphragmatic breathing into your aquatic activities can help you relax by stimulating the vagus nerve and activating the parasympathetic nervous system, also known as the rest and digest systems,” See says. ﻿“Water has a calming effect for many people, partially due to the tactile stimulation on the skin. “Movement in warm water can be relaxing and meditative and generally improves your mood,” she adds. 4. You would like to have more energy Any type of movement can give you more energy, and for those who are unable to exercise on land, water can be a solution. See says cardiovascular exercise makes your heart and lungs work more efficiently, delivering oxygen and nutrients throughout your body. With improved heart and lung function, she says, you’ll have more energy to exercise and perform activities of daily living. Similarly, building strength and endurance, as well as flexibility, allows your body to move more efficiently. “When you’re not having to expend extra energy to move and complete daily tasks, your overall performance improves; you don’t have to work as hard to accomplish the same tasks,” See says. Exercising in the water can also help improve your sleep. “The more active you are, including being active in the water, the better you’ll sleep, and the better you sleep, the more energy you’ll have,” Utendorf says. 5. You want to improve your balance Balance is important, especially as you age. Many older people are afraid that a loss of balance could result in a fall and/or a hip fracture that can be debilitating and life-threatening. With practice and time, Murray says, you can work in the water, a safe environment, to help prevent falls on land. “Practicing balance in a pool allows you more time to react if you do lose your balance, and by training your muscles to react to waves in the water, you’ll build confidence and lessen your fear of falling on land,” he says. In water, waves created by other people push you around, so even when you’re still, you’re practicing balance. “To build up that balance, you can begin with simple activities like walking in the water and move on to more advanced exercises like marching in place and standing on one leg,” Murray says. 6. You are overweight If you’re seriously overweight, you may not be able to tolerate the stress of land-based exercise. The buoyancy of water takes that stress off your joints. “When you exercise in water, you put less weight on your joints, making it possible, if you’re carrying extra weight, to increase your endurance and spend more time working out,” Murray says. 7. You want to make more friends Any group exercise, including water exercise, builds community. See says you’ll meet people with similar needs and find support and bond. For many, she notes, especially older adults, time in the water offers a fun way to interact with others while improving their health. “Doing pool exercise is a great way to socialize, because people are more motivated when they’re having fun,” Murray says. Based in New York, Barbara Sadick is a freelance health journalist. Her work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, U.S. News & World Report and The Washington Post, among other publications.","The article explores the benefits of water aerobics, a low-impact exercise that can be beneficial for individuals with joint problems, heart disease, stress, and those seeking to improve their balance and energy levels.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/every-vaccine-needed-after-age-50/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by 8 Vaccines You Need After 50 ​Check out this list of what you need and when By Barbara Stepko and Michelle Crouch, Updated October 24, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published August 11, 2018 / Updated October 24, 2024 Getty Images You already know it’s important to get your flu vaccine every year, ideally by the end of October. And when you go in for the shot, it’s a great time to make sure you’re up-to-date on all the other immunizations you should be receiving as an adult. After all, it’s not just babies and youngsters who need a poke to protect against serious, and potentially lethal, diseases. Adults need them too, especially as our immune systems weaken with age. So what shots should you get at 50 and beyond? “There are new vaccines that have come out in the past several years, specifically aimed at older adults,” says Morgan Katz, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Take for example, the new RSV vaccine, which was approved last year. ﻿ Another is Shingrix, the amazingly effective shingles vaccine. And a few pneumococcal vaccines are on the market as well. Below you’ll find the vaccinations every adult needs, followed by two — for hepatitis A and B — that you need only if you have certain risk factors. What you won’t see on the list? Measles and chicken pox vaccines. Anyone born before 1957 doesn’t need a measles vaccine because the disease was so prevalent when they grew up that immunity as an adult is assumed, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says adults who do not have presumed immunity should get at least one dose ﻿﻿of MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. Chicken pox is similar in that most adults already have immunity from childhood exposure to the disease, Katz says. “Almost all adults over 40 have been exposed to chicken pox,” she says, noting that it would be “an extremely rare case” for an adult not to have been. That said, if you think you could be in that tiny minority, ask your doctor about getting the chicken pox vaccine as an adult. For the rest of the list, you can get your necessary shots at doctors’ offices, pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics and other locations. And most health insurance plans will pick up the tab. So stop in and let ’em stick it to you. 1. Influenza vaccine Who needs it: All adults, no matter the age. How often: Once a year. “The virus itself changes every year,” Katz says. “Researchers try to predict what will be the most common strain that season, then reformulate the vaccine accordingly.” Flu season typically begins in October and ends in March, so the CDC recommends rolling up your sleeve by the end of October, since it takes about two weeks after a vaccination for flu-fighting antibodies to develop in the body. What you need: Adults 65 and older should make sure they receive a high-dose version of the shot. The options include: Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is an injectable vaccine that contains four times the antigen (the flu proteins that our immune system recognizes and attacks) of a standard-dose inactivated flu vaccine, to help create a stronger immune response.Fluad Quadrivalent is an adjuvanted flu vaccine, made with an MF59 adjuvant, an additive that creates a more robust immune response.Flublok Quadrivalent. This is a recombinant vaccine, which means it does not require an egg-grown virus and does not use chicken eggs in the manufacturing process. This may be a good option if you are allergic to eggs (the Fluzone and Fluad offerings are grown in eggs). Flublok Quadrivalent contains three times the antigen of other standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines. Why you need it: Each year, the flu is to blame for hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths, and older adults are at higher risk for these serious outcomes. Fifty to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur among people 65 and older, according to the CDC, and 70 to 85 percent of flu-related deaths occur among this age group. Talk to your doctor if: You’ve had a severe reaction to the flu shot in the past, are allergic to eggs, have (or have had) Guillain-Barré syndrome or have a fever. (In that case, you’ll likely be asked to wait until your temp is back to normal before you get the vaccine.) Parting shot: Even if you’re vaccinated, there’s a possibility you could get the flu. How well the inoculation protects depends on different factors, including your age and health status. That said, a flu vaccination may lessen the severity of illness if you do get sick. Research, including a study published Aug. 29, 2024, finds that flu vaccination ​reduces flu-related hospitalizations and deaths, including among older adults. 2. COVID-19 vaccine Who needs it: It’s recommended for everyone 6 months and older, and especially for people 50 and older, who are considered to be at increased risk for complications from a coronavirus infection. How often: Health officials haven’t set a schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, but it’s likely the shot will become an annual one for some people at least, much like the flu vaccine. For now, the advice from health experts is to “stay up to date” on your vaccines and get one before the fall and winter virus season. Updated COVID-19 shots were recently approved and are available in doctors’ offices and pharmacies throughout the country. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Adults 65 and older should plan on getting a second dose of the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine in the spring (six months after the first dose), the CDC said on Oct. 23. The updated recommendation ""acknowledges the increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19 in older adults and those who are immunocompromised, along with the currently available data on vaccine effectiveness and year-round circulation of COVID-19,"" health officials said in a statement. What you need: An updated COVID-19 vaccine from either Moderna﻿, Pfizer-BioNTech or Novavax. Why you need it: COVID-19 has killed nearly 1.2 million Americans since it started circulating in the U.S. and has hospitalized millions of others. It’s especially risky for adults 50 and older, who are more likely to suffer complications from an infection. Talk to your doctor if: You’ve had a severe allergic reaction to a medication or vaccine in the past. Parting shot: Make it easy on yourself and get your new COVID-19 vaccine when you go in for your flu shot. Experts say there’s no need to schedule a separate appointment. 3. RSV vaccine Who needs it: In recently updated guidance, the CDC says adults ages 75 and older should get the vaccine to protect against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as should people ages 60 to 74 who live in nursing homes or who have certain medical conditions that put them at increased risk for severe illness, like heart and lung disease. How often: For now, you need to get it only once. However, the RSV vaccine is still pretty new, so recommendations could change. What you need: Three vaccines have been approved for older adults: Arexvy, from manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline, Abrysvo, from drugmaker Pfizer, and mRESVIA, from Moderna. Why you need it: RSV is often associated with children, but it can be especially dangerous for older adults too. Each year, it causes 60,000 to 160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000 to 10,000 deaths among adults 65 and older, according to the CDC. In clinical trials, the vaccines were found to significantly reduce the risk of serious symptoms from an infection. ﻿ Talk to your doctor if: You’re in the 60-74 age range and are unsure whether your underlying health issues put you at greater risk for complications from an RSV infection. Parting shot: The vaccine could be especially helpful when it comes to avoiding a fall/winter “tripledemic” — a name used to describe the convergence of flu, COVID-19 and RSV. 4. Pneumococcal vaccine Who needs it: Healthy adults 50 and older, or adults 19-49 with certain risk factors (smoking or health problems such as chronic lung or heart disease, leukemia, lymphoma or alcoholism). How often: Adults who haven’t received a pneumococcal vaccine should opt for either the PCV15, PCV20 or PCV21. If PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23 a year later. (If you’re immunocompromised, you may get it sooner.) ﻿ Why you need it: Before COVID-19 came along, pneumococcal disease, which can cause pneumonia, killed more people in the U.S. each year than all other vaccine-preventable diseases combined. Young children and those over 65 have the highest incidence of serious illness, and older adults are more likely to die from it. Experts estimate PCV13 (one of the pneumococcal vaccines available) prevented more than 30,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease and 3,000 deaths in its first three years of use. Parting shot: If you work around chronically ill people — say, in a hospital or nursing home — you should get the vaccine, even if you’re healthy. 5. Tdap vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) and/or the Td booster (tetanus, diphtheria) Who needs it: The Tdap vaccine came out in 2005, and along with protecting against tetanus and diphtheria, like the vaccine it replaced, it includes additional protection against whooping cough, also known as pertussis. If you can’t remember ever getting this shot, you probably need it. Doing so, Katz says, can count for one of the Td boosters you’re supposed to get every 10 years. (You know the one … it’s the shot you wonder if you’re current on after you step on a rusty nail during your vacation.) How often: Adults should receive a booster dose of either Tdap or Td (a different vaccine that protects against tetanus and diphtheria but not pertussis) every 10 years, the CDC says, or after five years if you get a severe wound or burn. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Why you need it: Due to a rise in whooping cough cases in the U.S., you really do need to be vaccinated against it, even if you’re over 65. In the first year after getting vaccinated, Tdap prevents the illness in about 7 out of 10 people who received the vaccine. Talk to your doctor if: You have epilepsy or other nervous system problems, had severe swelling or pain after a previous dose of either vaccine, or have (or have had) Guillain-Barré syndrome. Parting shot: This vaccine is especially crucial for people — including parents, grandparents and childcare providers — who have close contact with children younger than 12 months. 6. Shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine Who needs it: The CDC recommends that everyone 50 and older get the Shingrix shingles vaccine, even if they had the earlier recommended vaccine, Zostavax — which was much less effective — and even if they’ve already had shingles. How often: Shingrix comes in two doses, spaced two to six months apart. Why you need it: One in 3 people will get shingles, usually after age 50. The risk rises with age. By 85, half of adults will have had at least one outbreak. Chicken pox and shingles are caused by the same virus, varicella zoster. After a person recovers from chicken pox, this virus stays dormant for decades in the body, ready to appear when the immune system is weakened by stress, medication or disease. This infection causes a red rash and painful blisters. About 15 percent of sufferers are left with extreme nerve pain — a condition called postherpetic neuralgia, which can last for months or years. Shingrix can protect 97 percent of people in their 50s and 60s, and 91 percent of those in their 70s and 80s. Talk to your doctor if: You are not feeling well or currently have shingles. There are few other reasons not to get the vaccine. Parting shot: Older adults should get this vaccine whether or not they remember having chicken pox as a child. Why? More than 99 percent of Americans over 40 have been exposed to the varicella zoster virus, even if they don’t recall getting chicken pox. 7. Hepatitis A vaccine Who needs it: People 50 and older who are at high risk for hepatitis A, a disease of the liver. Infections result primarily from travel to another country where hepatitis A virus transmission is common, through close contact with a hepatitis A–infected individual, or recreational drug use. How often: Once, but given in two doses over six months. Why you need it: Hepatitis A rates in the U.S. have declined by more than 95 percent since the hepatitis A vaccine first became available in 1995. In 2016, there were an estimated 4,000 hepatitis A cases in the U.S. Parting shot: This is a sneaky disease. You may not have any telltale signs — and the likelihood of symptoms decreases as you age. 8. Hepatitis B vaccine Who needs it: Adults 50 and older who are at risk for contracting hepatitis B, a liver infection. Hepatitis B is transmitted when a body fluid (blood, semen, saliva) from a person infected with the hepatitis B virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact or contact with blood or open sores (say, from a job that exposes you to human bodily fluids) or sharing anything from a needle to a razor to a toothbrush with an infected person. Other risk factors for infection include being on kidney dialysis, traveling to countries where hepatitis B is common, or having HIV. How often: Adults getting the vaccine need three doses — the second dose given four weeks after the first; the third dose five months after the second. There is also a combination vaccine for both hepatitis A and B called Twinrix, which is given in three doses over six months. Why you need it: The CDC estimates that the number of new hepatitis B infections in 2021 was 13,300. Talk to your doctor if: You have a life-threatening allergy to yeast or to any other component of the vaccine, or you are moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/statins-myths/,"Debunking Statin Myths The truth about side effects — and how to get more out of these cholesterol-lowering medications By Cheryl Platzman Weinstock AARP Comments En español Published January 27, 2021 Getty Images You know high cholesterol is not a good thing. But just how dangerous it can be was driven home in a 2019 study in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Scientists following 3,875 adults for 35 years found that those with long exposure to high LDL cholesterol — often called “bad” cholesterol — had five times the rate of cardiovascular disease and four times the mortality of individuals with optimal LDL levels. While the best way to lower LDL, which clogs arteries and is a significant cause of heart attack and stroke, is through diet and exercise, statins are the accepted second line of defense. And with good reason, says Nihar Desai, M.D., associate professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “The data to support their use is overwhelming,” he says. “They’re highly effective at reducing the risk of cardiac disease and cardiac events like a heart attack.” Yet only about 60 percent of people with coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease, or who have had a stroke, are being prescribed the recommended statin therapy, according to a 2020 study in JAMA Network Open. And only slightly more than half (or 47 million) the adults who could benefit from cholesterol medication are currently taking it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of the hesitation comes from concerns about potential side effects, which many doctors say have been overblown. Here’s a closer look at common concerns with statins like atorvastatin (Lipitor), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor) — and when you need to worry, or not. CONCERN: Statins can have a lot of side effects, including muscle pain, digestive problems and liver damage. REALITY: Patients who take statins are often told by their doctors to report back if they have muscle problems, which appear in about 5 percent of patients. But awareness of the potential for this symptom and others, like digestive problems, can have its own effect, says Roger S. Blumenthal, M.D., professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Baltimore, who explains that what may be at play is a kind of twist on the placebo effect, called the nocebo effect. A study reported in The New England Journal of Medicine in November 2020 found evidence for this idea. Researchers conducted a blinded trial of statins versus a placebo, or no treatment, among 60 patients who had abandoned statins because they had what they judged to be serious side effects. In patients who discontinued statin therapy because of side effects, 90 percent of the symptoms caused by the statins were also caused by the placebo. When patients complain of muscle problems, Blumenthal often stops their medication for a bit and then restarts it to see if it is still intolerable. Some patients will do better taking statins every other day, or at a lower dose, he says. Donald Lloyd-Jones, M.D., chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, says that in general, atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor) are among the best-tolerated statins and also have the greatest LDL-lowering effect and best safety profile. Liver issues are another reported side effect of statins. Lloyd-Jones says that this problem occurs in patients who already have fatty liver, a metabolic disorder that causes fat buildup in the liver. Rarely do patients get earlier, mild liver inflammation from statins, he says. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services notes that serious risks are rare with statins, and that studies involving thousands of people show no differences in muscle aches and liver abnormalities between those taking a statin and those on an inactive pill. CONCERN: Statins cause diabetes. REALITY: Statins can increase the risk of developing diabetes by about 30 percent in people already at risk for the disease or who have prediabetes, according to a 2017 study in a British medical journal. “People with normal blood sugar do not develop diabetes because you put them on a statin. These people were going to become diabetic anyway. Maybe we accelerated their diabetes slightly,” says Lloyd-Jones. “We don’t prevent diabetes by withholding statins. We do it with lifestyle changes.” CONCERN: Statins cause dementia, or cognitive dysfunction. REALITY: There have been many studies on the use of statin medications to prevent heart attacks that have shown that the statins don’t cause cognitive problems, including dementia. In fact, they have been shown to prevent dementia with long-term use. In a study reported in Scientific Reports in 2018, researchers found that statin users without baseline cognitive problems had between a 15 and 26 percent reduced risk of developing dementia and mild cognitive dysfunction. “It’s extremely rare that statins are associated with a change in mental status, quite rare in fact, because statins prevent little strokes that add up to dementia,” says Lloyd-Jones. Getting Better Results With a Second Rx If you’re taking a statin as prescribed to lower your bad cholesterol, cheers to you. But you should also know that statins are no longer your only Rx option. Designed either to work with statins or on their own, newer PCSK9 inhibitors lower LDL even further — and don’t have to be taken every day. They also appear to have very few side effects, one reason cardiologists we talked to called them “exciting” and “revolutionary” for their field. How much more bang do they give for the buck? When used alongside statins, they can lower cholesterol by as much as 70 percent compared to the 50 to 60 percent reduction statins alone provide. These medications — called alirocumab (Praluent), evolocumab (Repatha) and inclisiran (Leqvio) — could also be a good option on their own if you’re one of the 5 to 10 percent of patients who can’t tolerate statins. Here is what they can do for you. • Repatha and Praluent. These drugs were approved for use in 2015 and are the most potent non-statin drugs to come to market, says Lloyd-Jones. Studies have shown that they can lower the risk of serious cardiac events, such as heart attack and stroke, by 15 percent compared with a placebo. They’re recommended for people with high LDL levels that can’t be controlled by statins, or those who have a genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, which can cause dangerously high cholesterol levels. They’re novel monoclonal antibodies, or proteins made in the lab, that target and inactivate a protein in the liver that can block your body from sweeping away excess LDL cholesterol. A bonus is that both drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, can be self-administered by an easy injection once or twice a month. The hitch is that they can be expensive. • Leqvio. Federally approved in the U.S. in December 202﻿1, this drug completely blocks the production of PCSK9 (that problematic liver protein that otherwise raises cholesterol). “It’s a potential revolution in cholesterol control” because after two starter doses, it can be given every six months at your doctor’s office, says Lloyd-Jones. In addition, its efficacy is comparable to other medications. • Nexletol. This is an oral, once-daily non-statin medication for lowering LDL cholesterol. It’s not technically a PCSK9 inhibitor but works in a similar way by limiting your liver from producing cholesterol. It’s not as effective as the above injectable medications — when combined with Zetia, another non-statin, it lowered cholesterol by 36 percent. However, it is very well tolerated by patients, with minimal side effects, such as muscle aches. A new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in March 2023 found that treatment with Nexletol was associated with a lower risk of major cardiac events.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/covid-pandemic-5-year-anniversary/#comments_widget_id,"94 Percent of COVID Deaths Have Been Among Adults 50-Plus It’s been five years since the start of the pandemic, and older adults continue to bear its burden By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments Published March 14, 2025 Long COVID survivor, Cathy Lydon Mesa. Frankie Alduino Catherine Lydon Mesa remembers feeling like she had been hit by a train on a Saturday evening in September 2022. “I was shaking so much from a fever that I had my hand under my chin to keep my teeth from clattering so loud,” recalls Mesa, now 61. In the days that followed, she struggled to catch her breath, was tortured with headaches, and was so weak that she had to crawl from her bed to the bathroom. “I couldn’t even stand up,” says Mesa, who lives in Queens, New York. Sitting in her bed to eat a bowl of soup would exhaust her. The diagnosis: COVID-19, an illness that she had managed to avoid for more than two years since it first started spreading in the U.S. in early 2020. Given an underlying health condition — Mesa was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, in her 20s — she did what she could to lower her risks of getting infected with the coronavirus. She was vaccinated, boosted and wore a mask in public. Still, the virus eventually found her, and it made her really sick — just like it’s done to millions of older adults. It’s been five years since COVID-19 arrived in the U.S., and in that time, adults age 50 and older have accounted for roughly 94 percent of the 1.2-plus million American deaths. And while hospitalizations are fewer now than they were earlier in the pandemic, the illness is still sending thousands to inpatient wards and wings, and the vast majority are older individuals, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. Why COVID hits older adults so hard Biological changes that develop with age are a big reason why older adults have borne — and continue to bear — the burden of this disease. When you’re older, the immune system cannot fight off foreign invaders as well as it could in your younger years, explains Emily Landon, M.D., executive medical director for infection prevention and control and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine. “And as we get older, your body isn’t as quick or as good at recognizing when something’s wrong.” What’s more, older individuals are more likely to have underlying health conditions, like heart disease or lung disease. And when you pile on an infection, “those medical problems leave you at a disadvantage,” Landon says. An estimated 85 percent of Americans 65 and older have at least one chronic health condition, research suggests, and more than half have two. A 2021 study led by federal researchers found that diabetes and obesity were among the leading risk factors for death from COVID-19. An estimated 1 in 3 U.S. adults 65 and older have diabetes, and more than 40 percent of adults 60 and older have obesity. ‘We had tons of patients’ Anthony W. Okolo, M.D., was a second-year medical resident practicing in the Bronx in early 2020. “I remember when we started hearing a lot about COVID, it came in waves of intensity — that’s the best way I would describe it,” says Okolo, now a hospitalist and geriatrician at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. At first, he recalls chatter about the outbreak abroad; then the virus was in the U.S. “And then the hospital became a full-blown COVID treatment hospital,” he says. Patients were filling the beds, and many of them were older individuals. In Chicago, it was a similar scene. “We had tons of patients,” Landon says. “At one point, almost 50 percent of our hospital was just COVID patients. I mean, it was unbelievable.” By mid-April 2020, about a month after lockdowns started, the hospitalization rate for adults 65 and older was 30.7 per 100,000 people, according to CDC data. For adults under the age of 50, the rate was much lower at 5.1 per 100,000. “We didn’t have any native immunity whatsoever,” Landon says about the coronavirus in 2020. That has changed with the development of vaccines and with ongoing infections. Still, the virus continues to prey on older adults. In early January 2025, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate for adults under 50 was 1.0 per 100,000 people; for individuals 65-plus, it was 18.3. COVID’s lingering effects It’s not just the initial infection that disproportionately impacts the older population. Some research suggests that COVID-19 is more likely to linger in older people, leaving them with new or persistent symptoms — a phenomenon known as long COVID. A CDC study found that 1 in 4 adults age 65-plus have developed at least one long-term health issue as a result of COVID-19. Another large study published in the journal BMJ found almost 1 in 3 adults over the age of 65 sought medical care for new or ongoing COVID symptoms weeks after their initial illness. Mesa, the Queens resident who caught COVID in 2022, is one of them. About a month after she first got sick with COVID-19, she went to see her physician for an unyielding cough and prolonged exhaustion. Her doctor suspected it was long COVID but wanted to give her a little more time to see if the symptoms cleared. Sometimes it takes longer for people with underlying health conditions to return to normal, Mesa was told. Mesa gets a moment of respite in her bedroom. Frankie Alduino She hoped by the four-month mark, she would feel better. “That’s not what happened,” says Mesa, who was diagnosed with long COVID and is now a patient advocate for Solve M.E.'s Long COVID Patient Leadership Advancement Network. More than two years after her run-in with COVID-19, she still struggles with its effects. Everyday tasks like showering and driving can be strenuous. Going out to dinner with friends will wipe her out for the following two days. A simple trip upstairs, “and the coughing fits come on again,” Mesa says. She’s seen some improvement in her long COVID symptoms with medications, therapies and changes to her routine, but she’s still not back to her pre-pandemic self. Nonetheless, she says she feels “beyond fortunate” and tries to focus on what she can do rather than what she can’t. “I also have a tremendous amount of gratitude because I was so sick, I feel that I was spared for a reason,” Mesa says. Mesa gets a moment of respite in her bedroom. Frankie Alduino The Next 5 Years of COVID Living with long COVID Millions of people suffer from long COVID, and many of them are older adults. Some of the most common symptoms older adults experience include: Extreme tiredness or lack of energy (fatigue) Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Coughing Joint pain and weakness High blood pressure Changes in smell or taste Difficulty thinking, concentrating and remembering (brain fog) Source: National Institute on Aging These days, we’re better able to disrupt COVID’s destruction, in large part because of scientific advances made in the past five years. Vaccines developed at record speed help keep mild infections from turning severe. One report from the Commonwealth Fund found that the shots averted 18.5 million additional hospitalizations and 3.2 million additional deaths between December 2020 and November 2022 alone. At-home tests that can alert you to an infection and prescription antiviral treatments to treat it have also helped turn the pandemic tides. “The medicines we have available for COVID right now are really good, but if you don’t know if you have COVID, then you can’t get the medicine,” Landon says, highlighting the importance of the nasal-swab test kits. However, with COVID here to stay, there’s more work to do in our ongoing fight against the virus. Many doctors and researchers say vaccine acceptance is key to our continued success. Roughly 23 percent of the U.S. adult population received the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. The share is higher among older adults, but not by much — an estimated 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had received the most recent COVID-19 vaccine as of November 2024, according to federal data. “I think because we remember so acutely what the pandemic was like, and to not be in a state where we’re hearing sirens going off all hours of the day can have us lower our guard a little bit,” says Amanda K. Johnson, M.D., senior assistant vice president of care models in the Office of Ambulatory Care and Population Health for NYC Health + Hospitals. “But getting vaccinated is important for you, and it’s important for your loved ones.” It’s possible we could see a combination flu-COVID vaccine in the next few years, which public health experts say could help boost vaccination rates. “For some folks, it is one or the other,” Johnson says. Making headway with long COVID treatments is another goal for researchers in the forthcoming years. “There’s not the research base to tell us exactly how to treat and manage that condition just yet, and so I’m hoping that now that we’re out of the emergency response mode, we don’t lose sight of the millions of Americans who are still suffering and living with long COVID,” Johnson says. ﻿ An estimated 6 percent of U.S. adults have long COVID, according to a CDC study, and a significant share of them (about 20 percent) say the illness limits their ability to carry out daily activities. “I just think that anything that anybody can do, no matter how big, how small, is a step in the right direction to helping the overall [long COVID] community﻿,” Mesa says. It may feel like the pandemic is behind us, but the public health community isn’t letting it fade too far in the rearview mirror. Now and in the years to come, they’re taking lessons from our experiences with COVID and preparing for future outbreaks — be it with the coronavirus or an entirely new pathogen. “It’s so hard to imagine that we are five years out from the beginnings of the pandemic, but I’m hoping that people bear in mind that this is the kind of event that has happened before, and it’s possible that it could happen again in our lifetimes,” Johnson says. Okolo adds, “We don’t know what’s coming next. We don’t know if we’ll ever have another pandemic to that scale, but I think what we can learn from COVID in real-time is the importance of having protocols and playbooks in place for if and when such an incident should happen again.” Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID Living with long COVID Millions of people suffer from long COVID, and many of them are older adults.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2022/long-covid-symptoms.html,"Most Common Symptoms of Long COVID Plus, what to do when the effects of a coronavirus infection won’t go away By Rachel Nania, Updated June 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published May 19, 2022 / Updated June 17, 2024 AARP (Source: Getty Images) ﻿Millions of people who have had COVID-19 find themselves suffering from a host of debilitating symptoms that can persist for weeks or even months after their initial coronavirus infection fades. This phenomenon, known as long COVID, has puzzled experts since near the start of the pandemic. And while research is starting to shore up some answers, Greg Vanichkachorn, M.D., formerly with Mayo Clinic, says, “we don’t really have [long COVID] nailed down yet.” A new definition for long COVID On June 11, 2024, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a new, universal definition for long COVID. The group defines long COVID as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” A big reason is because “it looks like more and more symptoms can be associated with this condition,” says Vanichkachorn, an occupational and aerospace medicine specialist who was the medical director of Mayo Clinic’s COVID Activity Rehabilitation Program and is now a physician with Delta Air Lines. In fact, the list of the most commonly reported long COVID symptoms maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes nearly 20, ranging from neurological complications to digestive disorders. Some studies have uncovered more than 50 long-term effects of COVID-19, adding issues such as hair loss and vision loss to the mix. Others estimate that number is much higher — closer to 200. Still, some symptoms seem to be more prevalent. A study published May 25, 2023, in the journal JAMA identified 12 symptoms that most set apart people with and without long COVID. They are: Post-exertional malaise, or the worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion — even minor effort. Fatigue. Brain fog.Dizziness.Gastrointestinal symptoms. Heart palpitations.Issues with sexual desire or capacity.Loss of smell or taste.Thirst.Chronic cough.Chest pain.Abnormal movements. New research from AARP reflects similar findings, with older adults reporting that their most common long COVID symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, cough, and loss of taste or smell. Results from the survey, published Feb. 6, 2024, show that nearly 1 in 5 adults ages 50 and older have experienced long COVID. Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID A new definition for long COVID On June 11, 2024, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a new, universal definition for long COVID. The group defines long COVID as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID Symptoms can be life altering The symptoms, however, are only “half the picture,” Vanichkachorn says. “The other half is how those symptoms really have changed a person’s ability to live their normal lives.” A handful of viruses can cause prolonged illness (experts call this post-acute sequelae), and recovery can be especially difficult for people who required hospitalization or intensive care. But what’s different about long COVID is that it seems to be more widespread, and the symptoms that people experience, even when they no longer test positive for coronavirus, seem to be more robust, Vanichkachorn says. “We’ve had patients complain of fatigue after a viral infection before … but patients after coronavirus infection, they really have some profound fatigue.” For some, this means routine tasks such as getting dressed or taking a shower require assistance. Others have trouble completing everyday errands like grocery shopping or doing the laundry due to their symptoms — “and of course, going to work,” Vanichkachorn adds. Among adults 50 and older living with long COVID, 21 percent say it has had a major impact on their physical health;﻿ 18 percent say it has affected their mental health. Twenty percent of older adults surveyed by AARP say long COVID has impacted their social life. Priya Duggal, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, estimates that 3 to 5 percent of people who have had COVID-19 “feel they cannot function normally in everyday life” due to lasting symptoms. Some people may be at higher risk A few folks may be more at risk for long COVID than others, though Duggal emphasizes that “no one gets a free pass.” People who had underlying health conditions before their coronavirus infection may be more likely to develop long COVID, the CDC says. Research also finds that more women report long COVID symptoms than men, and it tends to be more prevalent in middle-aged adults. According to the CDC, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to get long COVID than people who received the vaccine. And research, while still ongoing, has also shown that people who treat COVID-19 with an antiviral like Paxlovid are less likely to experience lingering symptoms. “When you’re vaccinated or when you treat yourself early on, the burden of virus is much less, and, therefore, I think you are less likely to go on to develop these longer-term symptoms,” says Paul Offit, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and author of the book Tell Me When It’s Over: An Insider’s Guide to Deciphering COVID Myths and Navigating our Post-Pandemic World. “So I think anything that decreases viral replication — whether it’s vaccination or whether it is early treatment — is a value.” Talk to your doctor early if you experience symptoms Lots of questions surrounding long COVID are still unanswered, but one thing is certain: Experts say if you had COVID-19 and notice any new or prolonged symptoms three or four weeks out from your infection, talk to your primary care physician. Don’t wait months before calling for an appointment, Vanichkachorn says. If you don’t have a primary care provider, seek care from an internist, Duggal adds. There isn’t a one-size-fits all treatment for long COVID, Offit says, and that’s because there likely isn’t just one cause. Right now, a lot of it comes down to managing individual symptoms and providing supportive care, and Vanichkachorn says the earlier you start that treatment, the better. AARP research, however, found that less than half of the adults surveyed saw their health care provider to address their ongoing COVID-related symptoms. It’s also important for people with chronic health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes to reach out to their doctor if they notice a change in their numbers after recovering from COVID-19, says Sabyasachi Sen, M.D., professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. It could signal a long-term effect from the infection. The CDC has tips for patients on how to plan for an appointment to discuss long COVID. The agency recommends preparing a list of your current and past medical conditions in advance, and writing down your experience with COVID-19 and any new or lingering conditions. Be sure to include: When they started.How they affect your life.How often they occur.What makes them worse. Finally, bring a list of your current medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to your appointment, and ask questions when you have them. ﻿ Editor’s Note: This story, first published on May 19, 2022, has been updated with new information. Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","The article explores the phenomenon of long COVID, a condition where people experience debilitating symptoms for weeks or months after their initial coronavirus infection. The key findings include a new definition for long COVID proposed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and the identification of common symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, and loss of taste or smell. A surprising insight is that certain individuals, such as those with underlying health conditions, unvaccinated individuals, and women, may be more at risk for developing long COVID, and that early treatment and vaccination may reduce the likelihood of long-term symptoms.",260
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/expert-advice-to-help-symptoms-of-menopause/,"Expert Advice to Help Symptoms of Menopause Gynecologist and menopause guru Jen Gunter gives tips for preventing and treating hot flashes, vaginal dryness, painful sex and more Sex and Your Libido By Elizabeth Agnvall, AARP En español Published December 20, 2022 More than 1 million women experience menopause each year, according to the National Institutes of Health. Although menopause is defined as the point in time 12 months after a woman’s last period, perimenopause (the transition to menopause) most often begins between the ages of 45 and 55. It lasts an average of seven years, but can be as long as 14 years. During perimenopause, production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone decreases. Scientists say the decrease in estrogen likely causes most of the symptoms of menopause. Symptoms can include hot flashes, issues with bladder control, trouble sleeping, mood changes and memory problems. Women can also experience changes in their periods and vaginal dryness, which can make sex uncomfortable. Although there are treatments and things women can do to ease the symptoms of menopause, one 2021 survey of more than 1,000 women found that 73 percent of respondents who were experience menopause symptoms were not treating them. The survey also found that half of the women said they experienced painful sex after the onset of menopause symptoms. Yet Jen Gunter, an obstetrician/gynecologist and author of The Menopause Manifesto says that she wants every woman to have the knowledge to help them with their own menopause. In a series of videos, Gunter gives advice and tips to help with common symptoms of menopause, and she clears up a few misconceptions. Sex and your libido Gunter says the subject of sex and menopause is not often discussed, but it should be. Shifting hormones during menopause can cause a decrease in sex drive around menopause for some but not all women. Some women experience an increase in sex drive. But about 27 percent to 60 percent of women experience vaginal dryness with menopause and perimenopause. This can cause painful sex, but sex doesn’t have to be painful. After talking to your doctor to rule out other causes of pain, Gunter recommends asking about vaginal estrogen. “The first step is talking about it,” she says, “because you deserve to have the kind of sex you want to have.” How to tame a hot flash How to Tame a Hot Flash Hot flashes can start years before menopause begins and are related to declining estrogen levels. More than 80 percent of women experience hot flashes during menopause. They tend to increase in severity and often become most troublesome during the transition to late menopause. But Gunter says women don’t have to suffer. There are things you can do to manage hot flashes, such as maintaining a healthy diet that’s high in fiber, includes at least two servings of fish a week and is lower in fat and sugar. Caffeine, spicy foods and alcohol can be hot flash triggers, Gunter says. There are prescription medications that can help, and there are some herbal remedies that may help, although more research is needed. Brain fog How Menopause Messes With Your Brain (and Why You Shouldn't Worry About It) About two-thirds of women notice changes with their memory during menopause. One 2021 study published in Scientific Reports found that menopause affects women’s brain structure and connectivity. Scientists speculate that estrogen may help protect women’s brains. The good news, Gunter says, is that mental performance seems to rebound after menopause. “I like to think of menopause as loading a new operating system in your brain,” Gunter says. “It can be a bit glitchy at first, but once it’s up and running, things work great again."" Irregular periods Why Are My Periods So Irregular? Gunter says the first sign that a woman is headed into menopause is irregular cycles. Periods will often start getting shorter and come later than expected. Some women have heavier periods. This happens due to changes in hormones during ovulation. As women get closer to menopause, their periods become less frequent. Because irregular periods can be a sign of some problems other than menopause, Gunter recommends talking to your health care provider about any changes to your menstrual cycle. How to Tame a Hot Flash How Menopause Messes With Your Brain (and Why You Shouldn't Worry About It) Why Are My Periods So Irregular? Elizabeth Agnvall is the health and healthy living editor at AARP.org. She has worked as editor of Staying Sharp, AARP’s brain health platform and as a health editor at the AARP Bulletin. She also wrote for the Washington Post health section.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

The article discusses menopause and perimenopause, addressing common symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and changes in libido. Dr. Jen Gunter, a gynecologist and menopause expert, provides advice on managing these symptoms, including the use of vaginal estrogen and lifestyle changes to alleviate hot flashes. A key insight is that many women are not seeking treatment for their menopause symptoms, despite available options, and that open discussion with healthcare providers is crucial. Gunter also offers reassurance that cognitive changes during menopause are temporary and tend to improve after menopause.",261
https://www.aarp.org/health/top-health-questions/,"Your 50 Top Health Questions Answered AARP answers your top medical concerns from our Exclusive Survey on Health and Aging By Mike Zimmerman, AARP Comments En español Published April 15, 2022 Getty Images Anxiety is practically a way of life these days. But who’d have thought that people in their 50s are the most anxious when it comes to their health? In fact, that’s what emerged when AARP surveyed 900 older Americans this past winter. That’s pretty remarkable: We’re in year three of a pandemic that’s been particularly brutal for those who are 70 or older, yet it’s people 50 to 60 who are the most freaked out about their well-being. “I would call this anticipatory anxiety,” says Manfred Diehl, a professor of human development and family studies at Colorado State University. “That is when people become increasingly aware they are aging.” And indeed, there’s nothing like encountering your face on a video call and seeing your grandparent. But being anxious about your health just isn’t good for your health. So, we found some real solutions to the real issues gnawing at 50-something minds, based on what you told us in our survey. It’s time for some answers.… Self-Care, Eating Well, Living Well 1. Well I’m in my 50s, but honestly, I feel like I’m still young. At what age should I get serious about my health? Right now would be a good start. Longevity researchers study a phenomenon known as future time perspective. The more time we perceive we have, the more we’re able to ignore the fact that we’re overweight, may have elevated inflammation levels and don’t know what our basic health numbers look like. If you haven’t had a checkup in the past year, start there. Get your blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol numbers checked, and make sure that keeping them under control is a top priority. Yasu 2. Wait — I heard doctors don’t worry so much about high cholesterol anymore. Is that true? No. High cholesterol, particularly LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, is still a marker for a higher risk for heart disease. And preliminary results from a 2022 study of more than 750 older adults found a link between high cholesterol levels and elevated dementia risk. So, stick to those statins, if that’s what your physician suggests. 3. Does all this ‘healthy living’ stuff really help me live longer? My uncle ate bacon every morning and lived to age 87. It’s not just about how long you live; it’s about how well you live. A 2019 BMJ (British Medical Journal ) study that had followed more than 110,000 people since the 1980s found that those who adopted healthy lifestyle habits such as controlling their weight, exercising and not smoking lived disease-free for far longer after age 50 (30-plus years) than people who didn’t adopt those habits (23 years). Science still hasn’t explained Keith Richards, however. 4. What’s the best diet? Is it keto? Paleo? G-free? Do I need to live on acai and buttered coffee? Healthy-food rule number one: no fad diets, no weird plans, just common sense. A recent analysis of 1,995 people showed that those who ate greater amounts of fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains and low-fat dairy — and lesser amounts of red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and sodium — slowed their aging at a cellular level. “Foods like sugar and highly processed flour can trigger inflammation in your body and are usually calorie dense as well,” explains registered dietitian Maryann Walsh, a certified diabetes educator and the founder of Walsh Nutrition Consulting. 5. I’ve heard that keeping calories down is linked to longevity. Does that mean I should be fasting? Multiple studies have shown that long-term calorie restriction can reduce metabolic function and slow the cellular aging process — in rats! Human trials have been limited. A 2019 study in The Lancet showed that people who reduced their calorie intake by 12 percent had lower blood pressure and cholesterol, increased insulin sensitivity and lower inflammation. The problem? The study covered only 238 people over two years, and the oldest among them were 50. Plus, calorie-restriction diets can cause muscle loss, which in turn can result in rebound weight gain and other unhealthy outcomes. Women feel worse about their health than men do. Across all age groups, 70 percent of men rated their mental health as very good or excellent, compared with 54 percent of women. Females worry more about joint pain and sleeping problems, too. Source: AARP/Interloq Survey Your best bet: Don’t fast, and don’t go on crash diets; just try to eliminate the junk calories you eat and turn to more healthy foods, especially fruits and vegetables. A good starting point is to reduce snacking out of boredom, anxiety or habit. Instead, stretch or walk. 6. I know what I’m supposed to eat, but how can I keep eating what I enjoy? In most cases, you can eat anything you want, Walsh observes. You just can’t eat as much as you want. And you have to include the fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains and fish you need to lower inflammation and keep your calories in check. 7. Skipping breakfast is the new diet trend. Good for me? Bad for you. Breakfast is important for a number of reasons, and one of the big ones is fiber intake. A 2021 Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine study found that breakfast eaters who ate more than 25 grams of fiber a day had a 21 percent lower risk of all-causes death than breakfast skippers did. And a meta-analysis of studies showed that for every day of the week you skip breakfast, your risk of diabetes grows. Yasu Women feel worse about their health than men do. Across all age groups, 70 percent of men rated their mental health as very good or excellent, compared with 54 percent of women. Females worry more about joint pain and sleeping problems, too. Source: AARP/Interloq Survey 8. Do I need all these prescription meds? Yasu One in 5 adults age 40-plus take at least five Rxs. The risk comes when you have multiple docs all writing prescriptions with no reliable communication between them, says Amie Taggart Blaszczyk, division head of geriatrics at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Pharmacy. Keep a written list of every prescription and over-the-counter drug and supplment you're taking, how often and the dose. Cross-check this list with each of your doctors. 9. How can I eat a healthy diet when I’m on a budget? “Hit the freezer section,” Walsh says. Frozen fish and vegetables are generally less expensive than fresh, come in convenient serving sizes (no more tossing half-full containers of spoiled spinach) and keep for weeks. 10. I have, like, a billion different vitamins in my cabinet. Isn’t that enough? Nope. Studies show over and over again that pills don’t work the way foods do. Example: A 2019 study of more than 30,000 adults found that healthy levels of vitamins A and K and the minerals magnesium and zinc may be associated with a lower risk of death — but only from food, not pills. We don’t fully understand why, though it may have something to do with the way the nutrients in food interact with one another. 11. You mean vitamin pills are useless? For someone in their 50s? There’s skepticism, with this exception: vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency in older adults has been estimated at anywhere from 20 to 100 percent. Sunlight and food clearly aren’t enough to get many people to the 600-IU-per-day recommended minimum, so ask your doctor if D3 supplements may be a good idea for you. 12. What about my fish oil pills? I read they may not prevent heart attacks, after all. True? It’s not clear. A 2020 JAMA study of more than 13,000 people with high heart disease risk (average age: 63) compared groups taking a common omega-3 formulation or a placebo and found no benefits to the fish oil. Other research, however — including a 2019 analysis of more than 127,000 people— showed that taking omega-3 supplements derived from fish oil reduced the risk of heart attacks and death from heart disease. Bottom line: Eat more fish and omega-3-rich foods such as nuts and seeds, and talk with your physician about an omega-3 supplement. 13. Is there a secret to making sure I get great medical care? Find great doctors you like and stick with them for life. Continuity of care is linked to fewer ER visits, better adherence to medication and longer life. Fitness: Maintaining Power 14. OK — more healthy foods, a good doctor and watch the pills. What’s another lifestyle change I can make today that will help the most? Yasu Go for a walk. Being sedentary, with low overall fitness, raises your mortality risk as much as, or more than, smoking, high blood pressure and heart disease. An analysis of studies on people ages 54 to 65 found that binge-watching TV for four-plus hours a day may make you 35 percent more likely to develop blood clots in the thigh and lower leg. 15. Is that all I need for exercise — a long walk? Yes and no. Research has shown that moderate activity such as walking has excellent health benefits, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week. Just over 20 minutes of brisk walking each day gets you there. “Doing the same activity every day over time has benefits, but changing it up could have more benefits,” notes Jordan Metzl, M.D., a sports medicine specialist at New York City’s Hospital for Special Surgery. “Doing a variety of activities, particularly as you get older, will challenge your body, lead to greater fitness and health benefits and help you avoid injuries.” He recommends swapping in weight training, swimming or biking, and yoga. 16. I hate gyms, loud music and sweaty people. What else can I do to preserve mobility? Play tennis or pickleball. “Mobility is all about the lower body, and your entire lower body is interconnected,” Metzl says. Unlike, say, running or biking, tennis moves you in every direction, challenging your hips, glutes and legs from a variety of angles. Basketball is another option. Plus, first thing in the morning, do some multidirectional lunges (forward, side to side, and backward). 17. Hmm, still a little sweaty. What’s a 100 percent sweat-free way to improve my health? Floss your teeth every day. According to the 2019 Global Burden of Disease survey, untreated oral diseases caused people ages 50 to 74 worldwide to suffer a collective 8 million years of life “with disability” in 2019. Yasu Yasu 18. What’s a worthwhile fitness goal for people in their 50s? If you dream of running a marathon, that’s great. But there’s a simpler goal within such big goals as well, Metzl says: “Just start exercising, and don’t stop. Build a foundation, and keep building with the next 30 years in mind. Then you can set more specific goals.” 19. I’ve been exercising but haven’t lost any weight. It feels pointless. Weight loss comes primarily from eating healthier food and fewer junk calories. What exercise does is dramatically lower your risk of age-related health issues, from bone loss to heart disease to back pain, Metzl explains. 20. My joints ache after exercise. Is arthritis setting in? Exercise soreness goes away after a day or two. With osteoarthritis, you’ll most likely be dealing with joint pain, swelling and limitations on motion, Metzl says. “Because we’re talking pain, people often think, I have arthritis — I need to baby it. The opposite is true.” Building up muscles around your joints will improve any arthritis symptoms you currently have and prevent more of them in the future. 21. Are fitness watches worth the expense? Top Lifestyle Concerns Among People 50 to 59 Back pain: 33% Weight gain: 33% Lack of energy: 32% Memory loss: 30% Arthritis: 30% Source: AARP/Interloq Survey A military study involving 1,500-plus soldiers is underway to test a theory that smartwatches can help soldiers manage stress and train more effectively. While definitive results aren’t in, if something can motivate and protect you, it might be worth a look. 22. I’ve had back pain for years. Do I have to learn to live with it? No, just the opposite: You need to learn to live without it. Recent trials have shown that when some people suffer chronic pain for a long time, their brains can still generate pain signals, even though the problem has healed. A new treatment — pain reprocessing therapy — teaches the brain to stop sending those signals. In a 2021 clinical trial, two-thirds of those who used the therapy for four weeks were pain-free or nearly so, and brain scans showed reduced activity in pain processing. 23. What else can I do for my bad back? Plank exercises, Metzl advises. Lie facedown on a mat. Bend your elbows, and bring your hands together under your chin. Now lift your knees, hips and torso off the floor, so your weight is on your elbows and toes. Keep your back straight, and don’t let your belly or hips sag. Hold this position for as long as you can. Repeat twice. Aging: Keeping Up Appearances 24. What’s a ‘healthy’ sex drive for someone in their 50s? If your current sex drive makes you happy, it’s healthy, notes gynecologic oncologist Elizabeth Poynor, M.D. If it’s low and that’s upsetting to you, it’s time to look for the root cause of your sluggish libido and address it. “Not everybody has to have lots of sex to be healthy and happy,” Poynor adds. “It’s highly individualized.” 25. I’m just not enjoying growing older. What’s wrong with me? “How old do you feel?” asks Diehl. Research shows that feeling younger is associated with better mental and physical health, cognitive function and satisfaction with life. A study that followed nearly 3,600 people for 10 years found that those who started out with a higher subjective age and depression ended up with more physical health issues later on. If you’re depressed and “feel” older most days, seek help. 26. What can I do about the stress in my life? Aggressively rethink how you react to daily dramas. A 2020 study showed that people experiencing “unbearable” stress lost nearly three years from their life expectancy. Always remember that stress isn’t a demanding boss, a struggling child or lousy daily news headlines; it’s your reaction to them. You have two choices: Remove the stressor, or learn how to react to it in a healthier way. 27. I try to ‘stay young’ in how I live and think. Am I being ridiculous? Nope, you’re just taking advantage of the way we’re redefining aging. People in their 50s to 70s today “were the first cohorts that grew up with better education, better health care, and developed different lifestyles,” Diehl says. That has translated into older people looking and behaving much younger than people their age in previous generations. Embrace it! Survey respondents aren’t clamoring for Botox and hair weaves. Only 18 percent said they were very or extremely concerned about thinning hair. The next highest appearance concerns were hair loss (17 percent) and wrinkles (15 percent), though those worries were higher among women.​ Source: AARP/Interloq Survey 28. I’m thinking about doing some surgical ‘freshening up,’ but is cosmetic surgery safe? The fact is, we’re surrounded by people who’ve had cosmetic surgery: There were 2.3 million procedures in 2020, and surveys show that about 90 percent of patients are satisfied with their results. And, in general, cosmetic surgery is safe. A study of more than 26,000 cosmetic procedures foud that only about 1 percent of patients experienced complications in the 48 hours that followed surgery. 29. My husband refuses to talk about his health or go to the doctor. Is he hiding something? Half of men admit that they don’t talk about their health, a Cleveland Clinic survey showed. “Not knowing there’s a problem may be preferable to the discomfort of learning there is one,” says Harvard clinical health psychologist Natalie Christine Dattilo. Forget guilt-tripping and nagging; you’ll only cause resentment. Try to give off calm, supportive and loving vibes. Be a good role model and take care of yourself in the meantime. 30. How do I shake this chronic exhaustion I’ve picked up during the pandemic? Eat nourishing foods. Drink lots of water. Change out of your pajamas. (Yes, every day.) And exercise — moving your body on a daily basis builds the physical and emotional resilience you need to make it through yet another variant. These are all what we might call “the self-care basics,” notes Barbara Hannah Grufferman, author of AARP’s Love Your Age. The Older We Get, The Better We Feel Eighty-four percent of those ages 70 to 79 said their overall health is good, very good or excellent; while just 74 percent of those ages 50 to 59 said this. 31. I had COVID last winter, and I still feel off. Is this long COVID? Data suggests that more than half of COVID survivors wind up with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. It’s marked by extended breathing problems, brain fog, headaches and joint pain. Studies show that the virus may persist in the heart, brain and spinal fluid for months after the initial infection has run its course. If you have persistent post-COVID health problems, see your doctor. 32. I don’t feel as sharp at work as I used to. What can I do? Consider different ways to reinvigorate your career. That might mean moving to a new division, pursuing a promotion or pivoting to another field entirely. Updating your skill set can also organically boost energy levels at work. Become active on social media channels that are relevant to your career, take a class, or freshen up your LinkedIn profile or create one if you haven’t yet done so. 33. How do I prevent myself from becoming a caregiving nightmare to my kids? Start a conversation now. “Tell them, ‘My passwords are located here; here’s my financial situation; these are the medicines I’m on,’ ” explains certified care manager Amy Cameron O’Rourke, author of The Fragile Years. Make these issues part of an annual family meeting, because what you want at age 55 in terms of, say, end-of-life wishes may be different once you’re 75. 34. A loved one and I are estranged because our values just don’t align. How do I reconnect? Some 27 percent of American adults are estranged from a family member, according to a survey by Cornell University sociologist Karl Pillemer. Whether your rift was caused by politics, unresolved childhood baggage or something else, move toward healing by reaching out and saying, “My relationship with you is more important than the topic we are disagreeing on,” O’Rourke suggests. Mending your family feud will do more than resuscitate your relationship; it may make you healthier. Health: Resisting Disease 35. I have hypertension. Are blood pressure cuffs worth the money? Yes. A 2021 study, over 10 years, of 11,502 people ages 45 to 60 showed that those with the lowest cumulative systolic BP readings lived 4.1 years longer and delayed heart disease by 5.4 years. Measuring your blood pressure frequently reminds you to do the things needed to keep it in a healthy range. 36. What’s the first sign of heart disease? It’s plural: unusual fatigue, sleep problems, shortness of breath, indigestion and chest pain, says Suzanne Steinbaum, an osteopathic preventive cardiologist. Take special note if the latter three happen when you’re active and go away when you’re at rest. 37. I love my nightly glass of wine. A little bit of vino is good for my heart, right? Maybe not. Several organizations, such as the Mayo Clinic, still endorse that idea. But the American Heart Association doesn’t recommend drinking any form of alcohol to gain health benefits. Research is beginning to coalesce around the idea that light or moderate drinking may not help to prevent heart disease — so much so that the World Heart Federation declared in 2022 that “no level of alcohol is safe” for your heart health. 38. How about marijuana? Is it safe? Not as safe as it used to be. A meta-analysis of studies found that pot potency — its THC level, specifically — rose 24 percent from 1975 to 2017. A JAMA review of studies of more than 1,400 people 50 and older found that higher doses of THC were associated with a higher incidence of thinking and perception issues (not the good kind), as well as dizziness. 39. I have the occasional cigarette. Does that really matter? Yes. A review of 141 studies showed that people who smoke just one cigarette a day still have half the heart disease risk of people who smoke 20. 40. Does ‘prediabetes’ mean you’re definitely going to get diabetes? Most-Feared Diseases Among People 50 to 59 Stroke: 29% Heart Disease: 29% Cancer: 27% Alzheimer's: 27% Diabetes: 25% Source: AARP/Interloq Survey There are no guarantees, but there’s a lot of evidence that making lifestyle changes now can dramatically reverse the direction your health is headed in. For example, preliminary results of a 2022 study of more than 8,700 people showed a strong relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and new-onset type 2 diabetes: The higher the fitness level, the lower the type 2 incidence. 41. What’s a simple, tech-free way to measure my health? Waist-to-height ratio. Strive for a waist circumference that’s less than half your height. 42. How much should I worry about cancer in my 50s? The median age for a cancer diagnosis is 66, meaning half of all cases occur in those who are younger. These are especially important years to pay attention to cervical cancer (median age at diagnosis: 50) and breast cancer (median age at diagnosis: 63). The good news is that cancer mortality rates have fallen about 32 percent since 1992, with an overall five-year survival rate of 68 percent. 43. So, if cancer runs in my family, I should get screened regularly? The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for several types of cancer, including breast, cervical, colorectal and lung. There is evidence showing that screening tests can catch these cancers early and make a difference in treatment and survival. 44. What about prostate cancer? Should I get a PSA test? Yes. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men besides skin cancer, and 40 percent of cases hit men before age 65. Nearly 99 percent of prostate cases, however, are treatable if they are caught early. And don’t panic if your PSA is elevated. Most men who have an elevated PSA don’t have cancer, and only 25 percent of prostate biopsies find cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. 45. My mother was legally blind when she died. How do I protect my eyes? Pop in to see the eye doctor for a dilated-eye exam every year, says Kenneth Dickerson, a doctor of optometry at the University of Rochester’s Flaum Eye Institute. Most eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, are silent sight stealers; without a doctor’s inspection, you don’t know you have a condition until it’s at an advanced stage. 46. Speaking of senses, what can I do about my damn tinnitus? There are no sanctioned treatments. Still, ask your doctor about neuromodulation, in which a device simultaneously delivers electric stimulation to the tongue and auditory signals to both ears. A 2020 study found that this type of therapy reduced tinnitus symptoms over a 12-week period. Brain Power: Remaining Sharp 47. What’s the number one thing I can do to help prevent dementia? Be in bed by 10 p.m. “The earlier you get to sleep, the more slow-wave sleep you’ll get,” says Sara Mednick, a professor of cognitive science at the University of California, Irvine, and author of The Power of the Downstate. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) supercharges brain health, clearing away toxins and other buildup that cause dementia, as well as developing connections between areas of the brain to create stronger memories. But SWS also abides by nature’s circadian clock and peters out at around 1 a.m., so you need to hit the sack early to maximize your time there. In short, you can’t close your eyes at midnight and still expect to net three hours of memory-protective SWS. A majority of respondents ages 50 to 79 said they’re afraid of losing their mental or physical faculties, becoming a burden to their families and having to give up their independence. As one participant wrote of Alzheimer’s disease, “It terrifies me to think of losing myself.” Source: AARP/Interloq Survey 48. Yikes! I’ll try to go to bed earlier, but I notice I sleep less now that I’m in my 50s. Is that normal? Yes, it’s totally normal. In your 20s you needed about eight to nine hours of sleep every night. More mature you needs about an hour less, notes Nalaka Gooneratne, M.D., a sleep medicine physician and geriatrician at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. You know you’re clocking enough if you’re alert during the day; sleepiness or brain fog signals a possible medical issue, such as sleep apnea, that you’ll want to get checked out. 49. About that nightly wine: It’s still good for my brain, right? No. No, it’s not. A study of more than 25,000 people in the U.K. showed that any alcohol consumption at all had negative effects on brain volume and structure — and that those who binge drink or who are overweight with high blood pressure are more susceptible. The study’s key takeaway: “No safe dose of alcohol for the brain was found.” 50. What else can I do to protect my brain? There’s no miracle pill for brain health, though one of the most important things you can do is keep your weight stable. A 2021 meta-analysis of data found that being significantly overweight increased the risk of dementia. Surprisingly, however, being underweight was also a risk factor. (Turns out you can be too thin, if not too rich.) Plus, getting exercise is important to cutting your risk. The full, exclusive AARP/Interloq survey of people age 50 to 79 is available here.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/heart-attack-vs-cardiac-arrest/,"Heart Attack vs. Cardiac Arrest: What’s the Difference? The two are often mistaken for one another, but causes, warnings signs and treatments can differ By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published April 22, 2024 AARP; (Source: Shutterstock) When Nicole Smith went to visit her 83-year-old father in the hospital last fall, she never imaged she’d become a patient, too. But that’s exactly what happened to the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, resident after she suddenly collapsed in the﻿ cafeteria. “I woke up and I was in the intensive care unit,” says Smith, 53. The diagnosis: sudden cardiac arrest. With no known heart risks or warning signs, she never saw it coming. “This was the furthest thing from my mind that something like this could happen,” she said. While often confused with a heart attack, cardiac arrest is a completely different health emergency — and it’s one that requires prompt recognition and response. Here’s what you need to know about each of the two conditions and what to do if you suspect someone is experiencing a serious heart event. Cardiac arrest What is cardiac arrest? Cardiac arrest is when the heart suddenly stop pumping, depriving the body and brain of oxygen-rich blood. The impact is immediate: Breathing stops and the person loses consciousness. “If somebody has a cardiac arrest, it’s not subtle. They are on the ground, and they are not responding to you,” says Gregory Katz, M.D., a cardiologist at NYU Langone and an assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. What causes cardiac arrest? Cardiac arrest is caused by irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, that cause the heart to stop working properly, says the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Many health conditions that are common among older adults can disrupt the heart’s rhythm and increase the risk of cardiac arrest, including coronary heart disease, a prior heart attack, atrial fibrillation, heart inflammation, cardiomyopathy (an enlarged heart), and leaky or narrow heart valves. Still, the NHLBI says about half of cardiac arrests happen to people who did not know they had a heart problem, as was the case with Smith. Sometimes heavy alcohol use or drug use can trigger cardiac arrest. So can severe stress, a blow to the chest (this is what recently happened to NFL player Damar Hamlin) and respiratory arrest, or when a person stops breathing. Are there warning signs and symptoms of cardiac arrest? Unlike many other health issues, there aren’t usually any signs or symptoms to warn an individual that cardiac arrest is imminent, though some people may experience chest pain, nausea﻿,﻿ vomiting or shortness of breath before losing consciousness. “People may get no warning whatsoever,” Katz says. What should you do? If you see someone in cardiac arrest, “the immediate thing that you do is you start chest compressions, and you call 9-1-1,” Katz says. Starting CPR — which helps keep blood flow active until emergency responders arrive — “really is the difference between somebody having a good outcome versus a tragic outcome,” he says. About 350,000 people die from cardiac arrest every year in the U.S., and less than half of people who experience cardiac arrest outside the hospital receive the right care from bystanders. The American Heart Association says anyone can perform CPR with hands-only chest compressions (no need for mouth-to-mouth unless you’re trained and feel comfortable doing it). Push hard and fast in the center of the chest to the beat of “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees or another song that is equivalent to about 100 to 120 beats per minute. And if an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available, use it. These portable devices that can often be found﻿ in public places such as airports and malls can stimulate the heart to resume beating. Heart Attack vs. Cardiac Arrest A quick way to remember the difference: Cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem If you see someone going into cardiac arrest, call 911 and start CPR right away. Heart attack is a “circulation” problem If someone is having a heart attack, call 911. Source: American Heart Association Smith considers herself fortunate that her cardiac arrest — which her doctor says was possibly caused by a ventricular fibrillation, or an irregular heartbeat, and may have been brought on by stress — occurred inside a hospital. She now has a small device known as an implantable cardioverter﻿-defibrillator in her chest to detect and correct any irregular heartbeats that could cause this to happen again. Heart attack What is a heart attack? Unlike with cardiac arrest, the heart is still pumping when a person has a heart attack; it’s just that the heart is under stress, says Mistyann-Blue Miller, M.D., a cardiologist with Cleveland Clinic in Vero Beach, Florida. And that’s because blood flow to the heart is being blocked. If this blood flow is not restored quickly, the oxygen-starved heart muscle will start to die. What causes a heart attack? Most heart attacks are caused by coronary artery disease, according to the NHLBI, or plaque buildup along the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Cholesterol and other fatty substances can lead to this buildup. A number of modifiable factors can increase your risk for coronary artery disease, including physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, smoking and being overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other risk factors include a family history of heart disease.

Heart attack is a “circulation” problem If someone is having a heart attack, call 911. Source: American Heart Association Are there warning signs or symptoms of a heart attack? Also different from cardiac arrest is that many people who have a heart attack experience symptoms. For some, they can start slowly and be mild. For others, symptoms can come on suddenly and be severe. “I describe it to patients that it can be anything weird between your chin and your belly button,” Katz says. And those odd or uncomfortable feelings typically gets worse with physical activity. “The idea that everyone has an elephant sitting on their chest as their heart attack symptom is just not borne out in the﻿ real world,” he adds. Heart attack symptoms can include: Chest pain or discomfortPain or discomfort in the arms, back, shoulders, neck, jaw and stomach (above the belly button)Shortness of breathSweatingFatigueNausea and vomitingLightheadedness or dizzinessRapid or irregular heartbeat Women tend to have more “nonspecific” heart attack symptoms that are easier to attribute to other things, such as stress, Miller says. “That can be a dull, achy feeling between the shoulder blades, maybe fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance,” she explains. “If something doesn’t feel right, definitely report that to your doctor.” Katz says older adults are also less likely to experience the classic heart attack symptoms. What should you do? If you suspect a heart attack, call 9-1-1 right away.﻿ ﻿ CPR isn’t necessary unless the person isn’t breathing or you can’t find a pulse.﻿ “You really need to go to an emergency room,” Katz says, where doctors can quickly locate and address the blockage. The longer the heart goes without oxygen, the more likely a person is to experience permanent damage, even death.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/dry-eyes-relief-treatment/#comments_widget_id,"7 Tips for Treating Dry Eyes Find relief from the pain, burning and redness, and get your tears back By Michelle Crouch, Updated October 09, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published July 22, 2021 / Updated October 09, 2023 KYLE ELLINGSON Eye Drops Recall The Food and Drug Administration recalled several brands of eye drops this year due to bacterial outbreaks and other contaminants. Find out more here. We wouldn’t blame you if the recent bacterial outbreak linked to several brands of over-the-counter eye drops has stopped you from using them. The news last winter was scary: Dozens of people were infected by the drug-resistant bacteria, including at least four patients who died and others who were blinded. Though the tainted products were recalled, they left behind uncertainty and hesitation.﻿ But eye experts would urge you to reconsider. “I definitely still recommend eye drops every day and take them myself for dry eye,” says Christopher Starr, M.D., a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine. The fact is, eye drops are one of the most effective remedies for dry eye. For a mild case, over-the-counter eye drops may be all you need, although your eye doctor can offer more treatment options. Here’s your step-by-step guide to getting relief. Take dry eyes seriously When your eyes are working correctly, they will constantly produce tears that keep the surface of the eye moist and comfortable. When you have dry eye, you either don’t produce enough tears or your tears evaporate too quickly because your oil glands are clogged. Left untreated, dry eye can lead to an infection, damage to your cornea or vision loss. An eye doctor can diagnose what’s causing your symptoms. Getty Images Common Causes of Dry Eye Medications, such as antidepressants, blood pressure drugs and sleep aids Laser, or refractive, eye surgery Age-related hormonal changes, including menopause Autoimmune conditions Contact lenses Clogged ducts Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke 1. Try eye drops and ointments Look for eye drops that say “lubrication” or “artificial tears,” not “redness relief.” Ointments and gels provide longer relief, but use only at night since they can blur vision. If you need drops more than four times a day, switch to preservative-free ones that come in single-use vials, or see your doctor for prescription drops.

Take a tech break When you use a computer or tablet, position the screen below eye level, take frequent breaks and try to remember to blink. Research shows you blink about 66 percent less than normal when you’re staring at a screen. Many doctors recommend stepping away every 20 minutes. 3. Unblock your oil glands Gently scrub lids and lashes with a mild cleanser twice a day. Getty Images Ducts along the edges of your eyelids generate oils to keep your tears from evaporating too fast. To help keep them flowing, wash your eyelids gently with baby shampoo or an eyelid cleanser, then lay a warm, moist washcloth on your eyes for a few minutes and lightly massage your eyelids. For stubborn cases, a doctor can perform an in-office procedure that uses heat or pulsed light to unblock glands. 4. Adapt your home environment A humidifier adds moisture to dry indoor air. Put one near your favorite chair and one near your bed when you sleep (keep the door shut), says Uyen Tran, M.D., a division chief at the Vanderbilt Eye Institute. Gently scrub lids and lashes with a mild cleanser twice a day. Getty Images 5. Move away from blowing air Air blowing into your eyes irritates your eyeballs and can cause tears to evaporate more quickly. A ceiling fan can dry out your eyes even while you sleep, Starr says. Point car vents away from your face, and move furniture you use often away from home HVAC vents. Throw on some wraparound sunglasses if you go outside on a windy day. 6. Try a different type of contact lens In most cases, contact lenses make dry eye worse. But ask your doctor about scleral lenses, which can help keep dry eyes hydrated, Tran says. “They have a water reservoir, so when you wear them, they constantly bathe your eyes in fluid.” 7. Get your ducts plugged A doctor can place “punctal plugs” into the tiny openings in the corner of your eye that normally drain your tears, a painless office procedure. “It’s like putting the stopper in the kitchen sink, so the tears you make don’t roll down the drain,” Tran says. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Reader’s Digest, Real Simple, Prevention, The Washington Post and The New York Times.","Here is a 3-4 sentence summary of the article:

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/weight-loss-foods/#comments_widget_id,"14 Foods That Could Help You Lose Weight These tasty treats can curb cravings and optimize your weight-﻿loss journey By Nissa Simon, Updated December 23, 2024 AARP Medical review by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published March 20, 2024 / Updated December 23, 2024 Sarah Rogers (Source: Getty Images (4)) ​Though no one food is the magic fix for weight management﻿, there are options that, when combined in an overall healthy eating plan, can give you a leg up in your weight﻿-loss goals. Weight loss most importantly needs a calorie deficit, or energy deficit. So that means you could eat only “junk food” and still lose weight as long as you ate less calories than your body was using,” says Sarah Wagner, a registered dietician at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. “No one food can make you lose weight.” Still, Wagner emphasizes that choosing nutritious foods is key for overall health. These foods help keep you full, hydrate your body, and provide the nourishment needed to thrive. Fruits and vegetables are important in a healthy diet, but no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients you need. For overall health and weight goals, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and whole grains, among its other benefits, has a positive effect on blood sugar, helping to keep appetite in check and promote weight loss, according to Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate from the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Avoiding sugary beverages, which are high in calories and low in nutritional value﻿, is part of the weight-control picture﻿, as is adding foods with high protein and fiber to your grocery list. And, of course, although it’s not a dietary recommendation, remaining active plays a role in controlling weight. ​ Here are 14 foods that can help you reach your weight goals. Although these foods burn calories, consider them only part of the weight-loss effort, which also involves regular physical activity, adequate sleep and controlling stress. Foods to eat to lose weight 1. Apples These crunchy beauties are low in calories, high in fiber and filling, all attributes that benefit weight loss. A medium apple contains approximately 5 grams of fiber, enough to slow digestion so you don’t feel hungry after a snack or a meal. Apples also boast a high water content; about 85 percent of their weight is water, which helps to temper your appetite. According to the Cleveland Clinic, apples make a satisfying snack, and choosing a healthy snack over a doughnut can help you maintain a healthy weight. So grab an apple on your way out the door. You’ll look better and feel better. 2. Asparagus ﻿ Getty Images The delicate stalks of asparagus, which are harvested in spring, are low in fat and calories﻿ —﻿ really low. Half a cup, five cooked spears, contains only 20 calories, but those lovely stalks are high in soluble and insoluble fiber. Both types help keep you feeling full between meals because your body digests fiber slowly, so you’re less likely to get hungry. The downside: ﻿Asparagus contains a unique compound that gives urine a punky odor. Take heart: ﻿The odor generally dissipates within 24 to 48 hours. 3. Avocados What all avocados have in common, whether small or large, is that they’re pear-shaped, have creamy green flesh and a pit and are packed with calories. But those calories don’t necessarily mean that avocados will pack on pounds. People who eat avocados routinely tend to feel fuller for longer and eat less throughout the day. A study published in the journal Nutrients concluded that men and women who weren’t overweight to begin with and ate avocados regularly had lower odds of becoming overweight or obese. Getty Images 4. Broccoli Green heads of broccoli are available year﻿-round, mild in taste and,﻿ best of all, beneficial in weight loss. Water accounts for more than 90 percent of broccoli’s content. Carbs, protein and a little fat make up the rest. Broccoli, like other nonstarchy vegetables, is low in calories (about 35 per cup) and rich in fiber, making it a filling food that can help control weight. The leaves and stems of broccoli are nutritious, but the florets have an even higher concentration of nutrients and phytochemicals, naturally occurring chemical compounds produced by plants. However, you may want to introduce broccoli into your diet slowly; it has been known to increase intestinal gas and flatul﻿ence. 5. Fish For older adults looking to cut calories from fattier meats, fish—especially canned varieties packed in water—can be a great option. It’s loaded with omega-3 fats, rich in nutrients like vitamin D and selenium, high in protein, and low in saturated fat. Including one to two 3-ounce servings of fatty fish per week, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines, may lower the risk of dying from heart disease by 36%, according to a JAMA review of 20 studies. 6. Carrots Forget the Bugs Bunny jokes, it’s time to take carrots seriously. Research suggests that including fiber-rich carrots in your diet helps curb your appetite. If you want to lose weight, eat food that contains more water and fewer calories. Here’s where carrots come in. A medium raw carrot is about 88 percent water and contains only 25 calories. If you’ve had enough of orange carrots, the most popular color, you can also find red, purple, yellow and white carrots. 7. Cottage cheese People generally don’t think of cottage cheese as sophisticated or suave or worldly. But its lumpy looks hide a world of benefits, according to dietitian Julia Zumpano, of the Cleveland Clinic. Forget Swiss ﻿cheese or cheddar and head straight for cottage cheese, she advises. It’s high in protein, which helps curb your appetite and manage hormones associated with appetite and digestion. And﻿, believe it or not, cottage cheese has become trendy. For those with lactose intolerance, cottage cheese has lower levels than many dairy foods, and lactose-free cottage cheese is available. Getty Images 8. Eggs Whether you scramble them, hard-boil them or coddle them, eggs are a great way to start the day if you’re trying to take off extra pounds. They’re low in calories and packed with protein, which takes longer to digest, leaving you feeling satisfied and less likely to overeat at your next meal. An Australia﻿n study that provided either a breakfast of eggs and toast or cereal with milk and orange juice to overweight or obese men and women found that those who ate the egg breakfast felt less hungry and ate significantly less at lunch. Those concerned about their cholesterol may want to avoid or limit eating egg yolk﻿s and enjoy egg whites instead. For example, try an omelet with three egg whites and just one egg yolk. 9. Lentils and other pulses Lentils, chickpeas, beans and peas all belong to a plant family called legumes with edible seeds known as pulses. Eating about one serving a day of these nutritionally dense seeds promotes a feeling of satiety, a term researchers use when they mean a person has eaten enough to feel full. This satiety may lead to weight loss and better weight management. According to a study from the University of Toronto, participants lost an average of ¾ of a pound over six weeks﻿ ﻿b﻿y simply adding less than a cup of these seeds to their regular diet. Even more important, this modest amount seemed to prevent them from gaining it back. 10. Mushrooms Add sauteed mushrooms to your scrambled eggs in the morning for a great way to start the day. “Mushrooms can be an important part of a diet that helps with weight loss,” says Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Highly nutritious mushrooms contribute a savory flavor called umami to food without much in the way of fat or calories, so they may help people feel full for few calories, Glenn notes. 11. Oats Oatmeal, a soothing, old-fashioned breakfast standby, doesn’t look like much, but it packs a mighty punch. People who eat cooked oatmeal regularly have a lower risk of becoming overweight. A cup of cooked oatmeal contains about 160 calories﻿ —﻿ not much﻿ —﻿ and nearly ﻿4 grams of a soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which encourages a feeling of fullness and dampens the urge to overeat. To add pizzazz to your morning bowl of oatmeal, dress it up with apple slices, fresh berries and chopped nuts. Be cautious about “instant” oatmeal, which tends to be processed and could contain added sugar and sodium and less fiber content. 12. Nuts Contrary to what you might expect, studies associate consuming nuts of all kinds with less weight gain. A study in the journal Nutrients determined that eating more nuts may help prevent long-term weight gain. In particular, Brazil nuts contain the mineral selenium, which may improve the health of your thyroid, which regulates metabolism. However, nuts are packed with calories, so portion control is key﻿; aim for about a handful. 13. Pears Pears come in all shapes﻿ —﻿ round and plump, chubby, knobby as fists and, of course, pear-shaped. No matter what the fruit looks like, researchers concluded that men and women who made pears part of their everyday diet had a lower body weight than those who ignored them. The people who ate pears were 35 percent less likely to be obese﻿, and their diets were of higher quality. The study, published in Nutrition & Food Science, noted that people who ate pears had higher﻿-than﻿-usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper and potassium, all of them important for the body to function well. 14. Leafy Greens Arugula, romaine lettuce, spinach, kale, ‘spring mix,’ and other leafy greens are an excellent way to pack in nutrients without adding many calories. Even better for weight loss, they’re high in fiber, which helps keep you feeling full longer by slowing digestion, says Rush University System in Chicago. 4 Foods that sabotage weight-loss plans If you’re trying to lose weight, beware of the hidden calories in these supposed “health foods.” Here are four to avoid, courtesy of Emory University: Fruit-flavored yogurt Although yogurt is a healthy addition to a weight-loss diet, flavored yogurt is often boosted with added sugar﻿ —﻿ as much as 31 grams to a 6-ounce container. That’s almost 8 teaspoons of sugar! Ouch! Fast-food salads Beware the toppings on prepackaged salads. The dressings and add-ons can rack up as much as 500 unwanted calories. Enhanced water These drinks marketed as water typically contain artificial flavors and sweeteners. Refined grains Whole grains provide a ton of health benefits. They contain all parts of the grain, including fiber, B vitamins and essential fatty acids. But ﻿once the grain is refined to make it easier to use in cookies, cakes and breads, it leaves only the endosperm, which is nutrient-poor starch. Read the label and look for the word ﻿“whole﻿” before the grain listed. In addition, stay away from: Commercially baked cookies and cakes, which are often high in fructose, a type of sugar that can reduce feelings of fullness and increase your desire to eat. Fried foods and potato chips, including commercial french fries, which may taste good but won’t fill you up for long. Candy bars — well, you knew that. How to add weight-loss foods to your diet Keep fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods you enjoy on hand for easy snacks and meals, says Hawkins. To avoid spoilage, consider stocking up on frozen fruits and vegetables. Canned fruits and vegetables are another good shelf-stable option, as long as they’re free of added sugar or salt. Tip: Rinsing canned foods before using them can help wash away excess sodium and preservatives. “I love a hearty salad that includes a green vegetable, a whole grain or starchy vegetable, beans, lentils, or nuts, and healthy fats,” Hawkins adds. “For example, a salad with finely chopped kale, roasted sweet potatoes, toasted walnuts, goat cheese, and a vinaigrette makes a delicious combination. For a complete meal, you could serve it with a salmon fillet.” Soups and stews are another great way to assemble a balanced meal—plus, they’re budget-friendly if you use leftovers. Think chili with lean ground beef or turkey, beans, and fresh or canned produce paired with a whole grain. How to find your ideal portion size For personalized guidance, consider asking your doctor or dietitian for nutrition counseling. Medicare even covers medical nutrition therapy for patients with diabetes or kidney disease. “Listening to your body’s hunger and fullness cues is helpful so that you’re eating when hungry and stopping when full,” says Hawkins. For general tips, Hawkins suggests using MyPlate.gov as a resource for understanding food groups and serving sizes tailored to different calorie needs. “Generally, I recommend making half your plate fruits and vegetables, a quarter lean protein, and a quarter starch to create a filling meal without going overboard on calories,” she adds.

https://www.aarp.org/health/brain-health/info-2020/blood-test-alzheimers.html,"A Simple Blood Test for Alzheimer’s? ‘It’s Not That Far Away’ Doctors could soon have a new tool to help them diagnose the most common form of dementia By Rachel Nania, Updated July 29, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published January 25, 2024 / Updated July 29, 2024 Danielle Del Plato A new study adds to a growing sense of optimism that doctors could soon have a faster, simpler and more affordable way to tell if a patient’s symptoms of memory loss and confusion are caused by Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia that affects nearly 7 million older Americans. A team of researchers based in Sweden found that a blood test was about 90 percent accurate in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease in people experiencing thinking and memory problems. In the research study, primary care physicians were 63 percent accurate in an Alzheimer’s diagnosis when not using the blood test; specialists were 73 percent accurate when not using the test, which identifies a specific protein in the blood that serves as an indicator for the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, two defining characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease. The study was presented at the 2024 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference and published in the medical journal JAMA. This blood test and others like it are not widely available to patients outside of research studies, but they could be soon, and that would be a “revolutionary change,” says Paul Newhouse, M.D., director of the Center for Cognitive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and clinical core director for the Vanderbilt Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. What doctors rely on now when making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis is a patchwork of physical and cognitive tests and pricey brain scans or invasive spinal taps. With more studies like this latest one, blood tests could “serve as the first line of defense in diagnosing the disease,” Howard Fillit, M.D., cofounder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said in a statement. A study published earlier this year in JAMA Neurology examined the accuracy of a blood test that identifies the same protein in the blood, called p-tau217. The research team found that the blood test was more than 90 percent accurate and was on par with the gold-standard diagnostic tools — positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid collected from a lumbar puncture — in detecting the brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Previous studies have produced promising results, too, so evidence continues to build for the use of blood tests in clinical settings, says Ronald Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. “I think this is a step forward; this is important. This is something that the field has been waiting for,” Petersen told AARP. What are the benefits of a blood test? For starters, a highly predictive blood test could save a lot of time and money when it comes to making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, Newhouse says. PET scans and spinal taps can cost thousands of dollars and are performed only in hospitals or specialty clinics. A faster diagnosis could impact access to new Alzheimer’s treatments that are approved for patients in the early to mild stages of the disease. Research presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s 2024 conference suggests that the wait time for these treatments could be slashed by several years with an accurate and reliable blood test. “Currently, eligible patients are falling outside of the treatment window because it takes so long to receive a diagnosis. An easy-to-use blood test could help address that problem,” researcher Soeren Mattke, M.D., director of the Brain Health Observatory at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said in a news release issued by the conference. Another potential implication: Screening individuals for Alzheimer’s disease, even if they don’t have symptoms. Research shows that Alzheimer’s changes in the brain can start years, sometimes decades, before symptoms begin. Enrolling people in clinical trials who are in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s could help identify treatments that get to work before life﻿-changing symptoms take hold. How long before blood tests are widely available? It’s hard to say with certainty, but Babak Tousi, M.D., head of the Clinical Trials Program at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, predicts blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease will be widely available in the next few years — possibly sooner. “Widely” is the key word here. There are already commercially available blood tests doctors and researchers can use to assist in making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. But so far none have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and insurance coverage is lacking, so they’re not commonly used in clinical settings. The FDA’s approval is not required for laboratory-developed tests, like these blood tests, but many dementia experts say it’s needed to confirm their accuracy and reliability in a patient population, and therefore to boost their widespread use. Once a blood test is FDA-approved and accepted as an alternative to PET scans and lumbar punctures for an Alzheimer’s diagnosis — and insurers agree to reimburse the cost — we’ll see its full potential to impact Alzheimer’s care, says Anna Nordvig, M.D., a neurologist who specializes in cognitive disorders of the brain at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.﻿ The Alzheimer’s Association has also said it is working on guidelines for the use of blood tests. Concerns about your memory? Talk to your doctor It’s not just clinicians and researchers who can order an Alzheimer’s blood test. The first direct-to-consumer blood test designed to assess a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s hit the market in 2023 without FDA approval — and more could follow. But when it comes to these products, the advice from many dementia experts is cautionary. For one, the results won’t reveal whether you have Alzheimer’s disease; they’ll tell you whether amyloid is present in your blood plasma, explains Zaldy Tan, M.D., medical director of the Jona Goldrich Center for Alzheimer’s and Memory Disorders at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. The problem with that, he says, is some people test positive for amyloid but never go on to develop the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “My worry with direct-to-consumer is that people might make life decisions or other important decisions based on one blood test, which may not mean what they think it means,” Tan says. “I liken it to getting a cholesterol level. Getting a cholesterol level doesn’t mean that you are going to have a heart attack tomorrow.” A recent poll from the University of Michigan supports this concern. Researchers found that a significant share of older adults (74 percent) said a positive result from an Alzheimer’s blood test would make them believe they were likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease; nearly two in three adults (64 percent) said such a result would likely cause them significant distress. And nearly 80 percent of those surveyed said they would consider changes to their financial or advance care planning if a blood test result came back positive. “[Patients] need someone to put results in context,” Tan says. If you have concerns about your risk for Alzheimer’s, talk to a doctor — you can start with your primary care physician. There are things you can do that may help lower your risk, such as manage high blood pressure and treat hearing loss. Another reason to speak with your doctor: If you’re experiencing memory loss symptoms, it could be due to another medical condition, including other forms of dementia. “Not all forgetfulness is Alzheimer’s disease,” Petersen says. Side effects from medications can mimic symptoms of dementia — so can common infections, depression, sleep issues, even a vitamin deficiency. Your doctor can help rule out these other potential causes first and, if needed, refer you to a specialist for further evaluation — possibly even a blood draw in the near future. “There’s no doubt that there is an absolute urgency, and everybody recognizes that [a blood test] is the Holy Grail,” says Maria Carrillo, Alzheimer’s Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead. “And it’s not that far away.”﻿ Editor’s note: This story, first published Jan. 25, 2024, has been updated to reflect new research.﻿ Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

The article discusses the potential for a simple blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, a condition affecting nearly 7 million older Americans. A recent study found that a blood test was about 90% accurate in diagnosing Alzheimer's, outperforming primary care physicians and specialists, and could potentially serve as a first-line diagnostic tool. The test identifies a specific protein in the blood associated with Alzheimer's, and its widespread availability could lead to faster diagnosis and treatment, as well as earlier intervention in clinical trials.

Beware of Side Effects Nearly half of older adults take at least five drugs daily,﻿ and the side effects can add up ﻿ VladSt / Getty Images By: Michelle Crouch, AARP En español Published January 31, 2022 In March 2021, Mary Ann Johnson of Warwick, Rhode Island, reached down to pick something up off the floor and suddenly felt dizzy. She tried to get to the couch but tripped on a chair and fell, and the chair toppled on top of her. Johnson ended up with a knee fracture and a deep gash on her forehead. It wasn’t the first time Johnson had fallen in recent months, and she also constantly felt tired and weak. Fortunately, Johnson’s doctor recognized that dizziness and fatigue can sometimes be a medication side effect, so he asked a clinical pharmacist to review Johnson’s prescriptions. Johnson, 70, was taking more than 16 medications, including several that affect the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Pharmacist Brianna Kimball recommended that Johnson reduce the dose of one of her prescriptions and stop taking three others altogether. It made a difference. “I’m doing fine without them,” Johnson says, “and I haven’t had the lightheadedness.” More pills than ever Experts have warned for years about the dangers of taking five or more drugs at the same time — a phenomenon known as polypharmacy. Yet over the past two decades, the percentage of people age 65 and older taking five or more prescriptions has tripled, from 14 to 42 percent, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly 20 percent of older adults take 10 drugs or more﻿, according to the Lown Institute. Use of over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements is also at an all-time high, C﻿ouncil for Responsible Nutrition data shows. While medicines are critical for keeping us healthy, they all have side effects. And the more medications you take, the higher your risk of experiencing a problem or a dangerous interaction, says Sabine von Preyss-Friedman, M.D., a geriatric specialist and chief medical officer for Avalon Health Care Group, whose services include assisted living and home health care. Tips to avoid prescription overload Try nondrug alternatives. Before taking any new drug, consider whether there’s a way to try to treat the problem first without medication. Can you change your diet to control your diabetes or high blood pressure? Eliminate caffeine to help your insomnia? Read the medication guide or insert. Pay special attention to harmful interactions and side effects, keeping in mind that they may not affect you right away. Keep an up-to-date list of your medications. Make sure it includes over-the-counter drugs and supplements, which can cause dangerous reactions when mixed with certain prescriptions. Stick to one pharmacy. Discounts may tempt you to transfer your medications to different pharmacies, but if you fill all of your prescriptions in one place, it’s easier for your pharmacist to spot possible interactions and safety issues. Schedule a medication review. Sit down with your primary care doctor or pharmacist and talk about each of your medications and supplements — ask why you’re taking it, if there are safer ways to manage your symptom, and if it’s worth trying to go without.​ Every day, 750 adults age 65 or older are hospitalized for ﻿serious side effects from a medication, according to the Lown Institute. One ﻿Lown Institute study found that you are 88 percent more likely to seek care for a drug complication or side effect if you take five or more medications. Other research shows that your fall risk increases 7 percent for each medication you take. “It’s to the point that taking too many medications becomes an illness in and of itself,” von Preyss-Friedman says. Older adults at greater risk Older adults accumulate medications for a variety of reasons. It’s partly because they are living longer and are more likely to have chronic diseases that require medical management. But it’s also because when patients report a symptom, doctors have a tendency to prescribe a new medication first, rather than recommend a lifestyle change or consider whether the symptom could be caused by a different drug. “It is always easier to just add another medication rather than take one away,” von Preyss-Friedman says. Adults who see a few different doctors to manage their chronic conditions run the risk of having each specialist prescribe a different medication without taking into account the overall effect on the patient, says Hedva Barenholtz Levy, president of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists﻿ and an independent pharmacist in St. Louis.

Adults who see a few different doctors to manage their chronic conditions run the risk of having each specialist prescribe a different medication without taking into account the overall effect on the patient, says Hedva Barenholtz Levy, president of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists﻿ and an independent pharmacist in St. Louis. “I had one 74-year-old patient who had three prescribing doctors and 26 medications,” Levy says. “He was taking medications the primary doctor didn’t even know the other doctors had prescribed, and he was having multiple adverse drug reactions﻿, including drowsiness and inability to concentrate.” It’s also common for older adults to continue taking a medication for years or decades, without stopping to consider whether it’s still necessary, whether it could interact with new prescriptions or whether the dosage is still appropriate. Medication sensitivity increases with age Because kidney function declines as you age — and drugs are filtered by the kidneys — it’s not unusual for a medication you have been taking for years to suddenly start causing side effects, says Ardeshir Hashmi, M.D., section chief of Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Geriatric Medicine. “If you don’t reduce the dosage as you get older, the medication may actually be hanging around in your system, and then you take another dose and then another, and they keep cumulatively increasing until you’re at risk of drug toxicity or profound side effects that you didn’t have previously from the medicine,” Hashmi explains. Sometimes, side effects from a medication are misdiagnosed as a new problem, triggering more prescriptions — this is known as a “prescribing cascade.” For example, let’s say you take a medicine for heartburn and one day you notice that you’re forgetting things. If a doctor doesn’t recognize that your cognition problems might be a side effect from the heartburn medication, he or she may write you a prescription for a dementia drug. Then the heartburn and dementia drugs combined cause you to develop constipation, and the next thing you know, you’re on another drug for that. “You can end up on a long list of drugs that really were the result of one drug causing a problem,” says Chad Worz, chief executive officer for the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists. As a senior care pharmacist, Worz spent years reviewing the medications of patients being admitted to assisted living facilities, often because their families thought they were experiencing dementia. “We would discover it’s really not dementia, it’s delirium induced by their medications,” he says. “The last thing you want to do is put mom or dad in nursing home because you think they have dementia when all you need to do is take them off their meds.” A push to ‘deprescribe’ In recent years, many primary care physicians and pharmacists have embraced a trend called “deprescribing” — the practice of regularly reviewing a patient’s medications to reduce the number of unnecessary and potentially harmful ones. There’s even a nationwide effort to reduce unnecessary prescriptions in long-term care facilities, since their residents are among those most at risk of prescription overload. One study of Medicare beneficiaries entering a skilled nursing facility found that they were prescribed an average of 14 medications each.﻿ More than 2,000 long-term-care facilities across the country have so far joined ﻿a Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine campaign called Drive ﻿To Deprescribe, says von Preyss-Friedman, who is cochair of its work group. The goal is to reduce the number of medications taken by residents of long-term care by 25 percent. When and how to ask for a medication review No matter how many medications you take — but especially if you take more than five — it’s a good idea to ask your primary care doctor or pharmacist to go over them with you at least once a year, experts say. Having a medication review is especially important after you﻿ are discharged from a hospital or rehab facility, since it’s common for patients to go home with myriad additional prescriptions, Levy says. She also suggests asking for a review if you lose or gain a lot of weight, if you are diagnosed with a new medical condition, or anytime you develop a new symptom. “If something feels not quite right, always keep in mind it could be a medication effect,” Levy says. When you go for your review, bring a complete list of all of your prescriptions and dosages, along with any over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements you take. If you take a large number of prescriptions or have an especially complex medical history, you may want to reach out to an independent senior care pharmacist, also called a consultant pharmacist, who specializes in medication reviews for older adults. (Search for one in your area at www.helpwithmymeds.org.) The goal is not just to reduce your number of pills, but also to make sure you are taking the best possible medications for your condition at the appropriate dosages for the fewest potential side effects, Worz says. “When you get to four or five medications, it’s worth having someone look at it and make sure these medications work well together and you’re getting the benefits of them without the risk,” he says. “In my experience, it’s rare to find a patient ﻿who doesn’t have a medication problem we can correct.” Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation's top consumer publications.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/blood-thinners/,"What You Need to Know About Blood Thinners 8 million Americans take medication to dissolve or prevent blood clots By Liz Szabo, AARP Reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published November 15, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (2)) Tina Ridler knew something was wrong last October when her right leg became swollen, achy and hot. Her doctor suggested she go to the emergency department for a scan, where an ultrasound showed a large blood clot, which forms when components of the blood (red blood cells, platelets and protein strands called fibrin) clump together. This kind of blood clot in the legs, also known as a deep vein thrombosis, can be a medical emergency. Clots can travel to the lung and cause a pulmonary embolism, a potentially fatal complication that prevents blood and oxygen from flowing through the lungs, says Karol Watson, M.D., a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Blood clot symptoms Not everyone who has a blood clot experiences symptoms. If you have a blood clot in your leg or arm, you may notice: Swelling Pain or tenderness Warmth Redness or discoloration Signs of a pulmonary embolism can include: Difficulty breathing Faster than normal or irregular heartbeat Chest pain or discomfort, which usually worsens with a deep breath or coughing Cough or coughing up blood Very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting These signs and symptoms warrant immediate medical attention. Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Clots can form in other locations, as well. If clots lodge in arteries that supply blood to the heart, they can cause heart attacks. If they get stuck in a blood vessel leading to the brain, they can cause strokes. Ridler’s doctors prescribed a fast-acting blood thinner, called a direct oral anticoagulant, to break up her clot quickly. “When doctors saw my scan, they said, ‘Take this immediately,’” recalls Ridler, 59, who runs a wellness company in Rochester, Minnesota. The feeling she got was that “the clock was ticking.” Every year, up to 900,000 Americans develop a blood clot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including 60,000 to 100,000 people who die from them. Older adults have a greater risk of developing one. Clotting is a balancing act. For example, the body forms clots when someone cuts their finger in order to stop the bleeding. The clotting process helps create a scab over the wound to protect the body from germs and dirt. If blood didn’t clot in response to an injury, a person could bleed to death. As an injury heals, the body naturally dissolves the clot. Sometimes, as in the case with deep vein thrombosis, clots form inside the blood vessels even if no injury has occurred, and they don’t dissolve on their own. When a blood clot forms in a vein, it can block the flow of blood as it travels back to the heart. This causes blood to accumulate behind the clot and build up pressure, resulting in the sort of pain and swelling that Ridler experienced in her leg. Blood clot symptoms Not everyone who has a blood clot experiences symptoms. If you have a blood clot in your leg or arm, you may notice: Swelling Pain or tenderness Warmth Redness or discoloration Signs of a pulmonary embolism can include: Difficulty breathing Faster than normal or irregular heartbeat Chest pain or discomfort, which usually worsens with a deep breath or coughing Cough or coughing up blood Very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting These signs and symptoms warrant immediate medical attention. Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Blood thinners can help prevent, treat blood clots Doctors prescribe two major types of medications to combat blood clots — antiplatelets and anticoagulants — and an estimated 8 million Americans take them. Antiplatelet medications, such as clopidogrel and aspirin, are mainly prescribed for people who have had a heart attack or a stroke. These drugs work by preventing platelets — cell fragments in the blood that stop or prevent bleeding — from sticking together to form clots at times when clotting is not needed, says Darae Ko, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Marcus Institute for Aging Research/Hebrew SeniorLife in Boston. Anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin and a newer class of drugs called direct oral anticoagulants) work by interfering with proteins involved in the clotting process. Doctors prescribe them to dissolve or prevent large clots, Ko says. Someone who has a higher risk of blood clots due to another health condition, such as atrial fibrillation, may be prescribed an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants can be injected, given by IV or taken as pills. A closer look at anticoagulants Risk factors for blood clots Almost anyone can have a blood clot, but there are some factors that can increase your risk, including: Injury to a vein, caused by a fracture or surgery, for example Slow blood flow, often caused by paralysis or limited movement Increased estrogen Chronic health conditions like heart disease, lung disease, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease An inherited clotting disorder Age (risk increases with age) Family history Obesity Traveling for long periods of time (generally more than four hours) — especially if a person has other blood clot risk factors. Getting up and moving can help lower this risk. Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Heparin is one of the oldest anticoagulants and is given either by injection or through an IV line. It’s often given to hospital patients with clots because it starts working very quickly. Doctors may also prescribe heparin to prevent blood from clotting, Ko says. Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, has been used since the 1940s. This pill prevents the body from using vitamin K — a key ingredient in the clotting process. It generally takes about three days for warfarin to take effect. However, it can take longer — sometimes several weeks — for your doctor to make sure that the dose you are taking results in the correct level in your blood. Regular blood tests — known as a PT INR — are needed to check this level. If your dose is too high, it can lead to severe bleeding, especially in the digestive tract, Ko says. If the dose is too low, the medication won’t be effective at preventing clots. Warfarin wears off slowly, which is why if you are having a procedure or an operation, you may be asked to stop the drug several days beforehand. Some patients require coverage with another medication when they stop warfarin, especially if they are at higher risk for clots. Many foods, medications and dietary supplements — including alcohol, over-the-counter pain relievers, green tea, gingko and certain fruits and vegetables — affect the way warfarin works. People who take warfarin should talk to their doctors about what medications and food to avoid, and how to manage their diet, Ko says.

Getting up and moving can help lower this risk. Source: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Direct oral anticoagulant drugs are relatively new. The Food and Drug Administration approved the first of these pills, dabigatran, in 2010. Other drugs in this class soon followed. Clinical trials have found that these drugs work as well or better than warfarin to prevent clots, but are much safer, with a lower risk of bleeding. The American Heart Association now recommends these drugs for most people with atrial fibrillation who need anticoagulants, with the exception of people with certain conditions. These pills are also easier to take because people don’t need routine blood tests and don’t need to restrict their diets, Ko says. Because of these advantages, the vast majority of people taking anticoagulants now use these drugs. However, direct oral anticoagulants can be pricey. A 30-day supply of Eliquis has a list price of nearly $600 a month, compared to $2.22 a month for warfarin. When selecting the first 10 drugs to be included in Medicare price negotiations, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services selected two direct oral anticoagulants — Eliquis and Xarelto — because of their high prices and large volume of prescriptions. 5 health conditions that can increase your blood clot risk 1. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm that occurs when the electrical signal that initiates the heartbeat (in the right upper heart chamber) is disrupted and taken over by other areas in the heart. This results in blood not flowing smoothly through the heart, which can lead to clots that may be carried to other areas of the body, such as the brain. 2. Heart valve surgery or replacement can cause clots to form at the site of the new valve, says Ifeoma Onuorah, M.D., a cardiologist and assistant professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and a member of the American College of Cardiology’s prevention council. The risk generally tends to be greater with mechanical heart valves than with tissue valves. 3. Hip or knee replacement increases the risk of clots forming in veins of the leg. Blood thinners may be given for a short period to patients recovering from these procedures, often before they can get up and walk around. 4. Cancer. About one in 10 people with cancer develop a blood clot, the second-leading cause of death in people with cancer. 5. Blood clotting disorders, some of which are inherited. Side effects of blood thinners Because blood thinners increase the risk of bleeding, people taking them need to take extra care to avoid cuts and bruises, Onuorah says. If people taking blood thinners fall or hit their head, they need to “call their doctor or call 911 because we need to make sure that there is no bleeding in the brain.” Blood thinners can be risky or dangerous for some people, including those with disorders that cause them to bleed heavily. Frail people with a high risk of falling also face greater risk, Ko says. “When I have an 80-year-old patient who comes in with their family member and they have to be on a blood thinner,” Ko says, “I do talk a little bit about making sure that the environment they're in is safe and that there's nothing that will put them at risk of fall.” 5 health conditions that can increase your blood clot risk 1.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/best-exercise-to-lower-blood-pressure/,"View Series #1 Exercise for Lowering Blood Pressure This type of exercise is best for reducing blood pressure to healthy levels, according to a new study By Michelle Crouch, Updated April 25, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published March 01, 2024 / Updated April 25, 2024 Video: Wall Sits Can Lower Blood Pressure Want to lower your blood pressure? A new study pinpoints exactly what kind of exercise is best for easing blood pressure, and it doesn’t involve running on the treadmill or pumping iron at the gym. Instead, the study reveals that static isometric exercises like wall sits (also known as wall squats) and planks — which engage muscles without movement — are best for lowering blood pressure. The new analysis, a systematic review of 270 studies, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM), confirms that many types of exercise — including aerobic activity, weight training and high-intensity interval training – help to lower blood pressure, but it found that isometric exercises offer the biggest benefit. Of the exercises examined, the wall sit was the most effective, the study found. It’s long been known that physical activity has blood pressure benefits, but the review is important because doctors often recommend heart-healthy activities like walking, running and cycling as their top choices for patients with hypertension. But isometric exercises are almost twice as effective at lowering blood pressure compared with just doing cardio, the study shows. Study author Jamie O’Driscoll, a researcher in cardiovascular physiology at Christ Canterbury Church University, says he and his colleagues launched the BJSM review because they have seen the blood pressure benefits of isometric exercise firsthand, and they wanted “to draw together the evidence for the wider audience.” “These findings provide a comprehensive data﻿-driven framework to support the development of new exercise guideline recommendations for the prevention and treatment of arterial hypertension,” he and his coauthors wrote in the review. What are static isometric exercises? To perform a static isometric exercise, you hold your body in one position until your muscles tire. Examples include wall sits, planks and side planks, glute bridges and heel raises. Isometric exercises are a great option for older adults because they are low-impact and don’t require any special equipment, says Meredith Dobrosielski, an exercise physiologist and clinical research coordinator in the division of geriatric medicine at Johns Hopkins University. “It’s an easily accessible form of exercise that you can do pretty much anywhere,” Dobrosielski says. “You don’t need to go to a gym. ... You don’t have to spend a lot of time doing it. ... You just need your body. And the benefits are great.” But that doesn’t mean static isometric exercises are easy. Kerry Stewart, director of clinical and research exercise physiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, says holding your muscles in a contracted position requires you to “work very hard.” “That may be one of the reasons why it provides benefit,” he adds. Why is isometric exercise best for blood pressure? When you do any type of exercise, your blood pressure temporarily increases because your heart pumps harder, moving your blood through your arteries more forcefully. If you exercise repetitively, your heart gets stronger, so it can pump blood with less effort, and that can help your resting blood pressure to drop. Isometric exercise may offer an extra benefit because when you hold a muscle contraction, you restrict blood flow to those muscles, Stewart says. Then, when you stop the exercise, “you get a big surge of blood﻿” to the area, he explains. That extra blood flow stimulates the lining of your arteries to produce nitric oxide, which causes the blood vessels to relax and widen, which ultimately reduces blood pressure, he says. Stewart says he wouldn’t recommend doing only isometric exercises, but instead adding them into a program of physical activity that also includes aerobic and resistance training. “Combined training seems to provide not only a benefit for blood pressure control, but also for overall health,” he says. “That’s where you get the biggest bang for your buck.” How to get started with isometric exercise If you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure or other cardiovascular issues, talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program. The BJSM study found that just three sessions a week of isometric exercise can lead to a significant reduction in blood pressure. Doing wall sits, for example, lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a reading) by 10 mmHg and diastolic pressure (the bottom number in a reading) by 5 mmHg, the study found. The isometric exercise programs analyzed in the study commonly had participants do each exercise four times, with a break in between, holding the position for up to two minutes. Dobrosielski, who works with older adults, says if you haven’t done isometric exercises before, holding a position for 20 to 30 seconds is a good starting point. It’s normal for your body to start to shake as your muscle tires, she says. “You can build up to more time,” she says. How to do a wall sit Ready to try a wall sit yourself? Start with these steps: Stand with your back against a wall, feet hip-width apart, and place your feet one or two steps away from the wall. Keep your arms at your sides.Keeping your back flat against the wall, bend your knees until you hit an angle that you can hold for at least 30 seconds. (Study author O’Driscoll notes that your thighs do not have to be at 90 degrees to benefit from this activity.)Hold the position by pressing your back against the wall.Relax the pose by standing. Repeat for a total of four wall sits, with short breaks in between. Getty Images More Static Exercises to Try Here are a few isometric exercises that strengthen different parts of your body.

A recent study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that static isometric exercises, such as wall sits and planks, are the most effective type of exercise for lowering blood pressure. The study, which analyzed 270 studies, discovered that isometric exercises are almost twice as effective as cardio exercises in reducing blood pressure. Isometric exercises work by restricting blood flow to the muscles, and when stopped, stimulate the production of nitric oxide, which relaxes and widens blood vessels, ultimately reducing blood pressure. The study's findings suggest that incorporating isometric exercises into a physical activity program, in addition to aerobic and resistance training, can provide significant benefits for blood pressure control and overall health.",269

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/best-foods-for-constipation-relief/,"5 Foods to Relieve Constipation (Yes, Prunes Are #1) Irregularity is common in older adults, but the right foods can help jump-start your stool By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published June 15, 2023 Dusan Stankovic / Getty Images Can’t go? It may not make up for the bloating and bellyache, but if it’s any consolation, know that you’re not alone. About 16 percent of U.S. adults experience constipation, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). And when it comes to adults 60 and older, that percentage more than doubles. ﻿ What gives? “The GI (gastrointestinal) tract ages, just like the rest of a person’s body,” says William Chey, M.D., chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. Older adults also tend to take more medications than their younger peers, and many drugs and supplements can cause constipation, Chey adds. The good news is constipation can often be managed at home. Plenty of water and regular exercise can get — and keep — things moving. So can a few standout foods. Foods for constipation 1. Prunes Prunes are often hailed as the number one food to help you go number two — and for good reason. Prunes, which are just dehydrated plums, are packed with fiber, which helps keep food moving through the digestive system. They also contain the sugar alcohol sorbitol, which has a laxative effect, Chey explains. One study even found prunes to be more effective than psyllium (the active ingredient in Metamucil) for the treatment of mild to moderate constipation. Similarly, studies have found that prune juice is a safe and effective way to relieve constipation. There is a downside to prunes, however. They can cause gas and bloating — and the more you eat, the more likely you are to notice these effects, Chey says. 2. Kiwi Can’t deal with the unpleasant side effects from prunes? Grab a kiwi instead. Actually, make it two. A new study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that two kiwifruit a day helped to relieve constipation. Plus, research has shown that kiwi is better tolerated than prunes or psyllium, Chey says. 3. Oatmeal Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which helps to absorb water. Think of when you mix hot water into oatmeal and it starts to gel — that’s because of the soluble fiber, explains Ashley Baumohl, a registered dietitian in the division of gastroenterology at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. “Not only does [the fiber in oatmeal] help regulate your bowel movements, but it’s also actually softening them, making them easier to pass,” Baumohl says. Chia seeds — which also form a gel-like consistency when combined with water — is another example of a food high in soluble fiber. 4. Papaya Known for the beautiful orange hue of its ripened flesh, papaya can help jump-start a stalled digestive system. “Papaya has a lot of digestive enzymes, a lot of fiber and also some fructose, which for some people can cause a laxative effect,” Chey says. Mango is another fruit with similar traits. 5. Aloe vera juice Cruise the beverage aisle at your local grocery store and you may spot a thick liquid made from the aloe vera plant. A bottle of the stuff, known as aloe vera juice, comes packed with purported health benefits — from clearer skin to heartburn relief. The low-sugar juice can also help with constipation, Chey says, along with another plant, fresh rhubarb. “They actually offer a stimulant effect﻿; they stimulate your colon to contract and can help with constipation in that way,” Chey says. A few other tips: In addition to the foods above, a wide range of fiber-filled fruits, veggies and other snacks can help keep you regular. Berries, though small in size, are mighty when it comes to gut health due to their fiber content. They’re also versatile, Baumohl says. You can put them in yogurt, pile them on top of oatmeal or enjoy them in a smoothie.If you’re reaching for an apple or pear, keep the skin on to up your fiber intake. And add vegetables like artichokes to pasta, Baumohl recommends.Reach for nuts and seeds, which are a good source of fiber and healthy fats.Keep your meals varied and avoid an all-white diet (white bread, potatoes), which can disrupt regularity, Baumohl says. ﻿Fiber is key when it comes to staying regular, but if you aren’t used to a fiber-rich diet, make sure you add it in slowly. It can be a shock to your GI system if you suddenly load up, Baumohl says. Beyond food, pay attention to your posture on the toilet since this can affect your bowel movements. Raising your feet, leaning back or squatting may make going to the bathroom a bit easier, according to the Cleveland Clinic. ﻿ If your constipation doesn’t let up, call your doctor. Medication may be able to help. You should also see a health care provider if constipation is a new problem for you, you see blood in your stool, you are losing weight unintentionally or you have severe pain with your bowel movements, the Cleveland Clinic says. Foods to avoid If you’re constipated, or are prone to it, best to steer clear of matzo, which is dehydrated unleavened bread. In fact, doctors often recommend it for people who have diarrhea, Chey says. The NIDDK also suggests avoiding fast food, highly processed food (hot dogs, frozen pizza, microwave dinners) and meat. Wondering about bananas? Go ahead and grab one, Chey says. They’re known to help with diarrhea, but they can also help with constipation. “Bananas contain a substance called pectin, which has water-holding capacity. So if you have excess water in your stool, it’ll bind up the water and make your stool more fully formed. But the nice thing about pectin is that if your stools are too hard, it’ll also hang on to water and make your stool softer,” Chey explains. A Recipe for Relief Feeling backed up? Grab the blender and make a smoothie. Just add: 4 ounces of aloe vera juice 4 ounces of chopped papaya 1 whole, peeled kiwifruit Some ice “It tastes really good, and it offers a mild laxative effect,” says William Chey, M.D., of the University of Michigan.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/elderberry-for-cold-and-flu/#comments_widget_id,"Can Elderberry Cure Your Cold Symptoms? The supplements are marketed as an immune-boosting remedy, but like all pills and potions, can come with risks for some By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published February 19, 2025 Getty Images You’re laid low by a fever, chills, runny nose, congestion. Can elderberry deliver relief? Thanks to what are believed to be the herbal supplement’s immune-boosting superpowers (the tiny purple berry is loaded with vitamins and antioxidants), elderberry is having something of a moment. A growing number of people are reaching for elderberry juice, syrup, gummies, capsules, tea and tablets to help them power their way through a cold or the flu, while others are simply looking to reap the perceived health benefits. All, despite the fact that high-quality research into whether elderberry actually helps prevent and treat common respiratory infections is lacking, and the small studies that do exist are far from conclusive. Complicating matters, elderberry supplements — like all herbal supplements — are not subjected to the same rigorous testing, manufacturing and labeling standards as prescription and over-the-counter medications. For example, the label on an herbal supplement can include broad promises about the product’s impact on the body — that it “reduces stress” or “promotes digestive comfort.” And unlike highly scrutinized prescription and over-the-counter medications, standardization with supplements is lacking. “Unlike with pharmaceutical drugs, there’s no requirement that botanicals need to be prepared in any standardized way,” says Pieter Cohen, M.D., an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who studies supplement safety. “What we’ve found when we analyze botanical supplements is that the amount of active compound varies widely from one brand to another. So when you go to the store and buy elderberry, you have no idea what you’re getting.” What is elderberry? According to The Plant Humanities Lab, the dark violet-black berry’s beginning as a go-to for colds and flu dates back to 400 B.C. That’s when Hippocrates — the Greek physician known as the “father of medicine” — called the elder plant his “medicine chest” because of the many health woes it seemed to treat — from constipation to hemorrhoids to insect bites and upper respiratory infections. Although there are a number of elderberry varieties, it’s the black elderberry (Sambucus nigra) that’s believed to possess the most immune-boosting bona fides. It’s among the richest sources of plant compounds known as polyphenols, specifically anthocyanins, which have been shown to help immune function. Supplements aren’t without risks, side effects When people are considering any health intervention, they should take two things into account, says Mary L. Hardy, M.D., a botanical medicine and integrative medicine expert with the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine. “The first is safety, and a close second is efficacy. Is it safe, and does it work?” Apart from the big caveat with elderberry — when eaten raw, the berries can be poisonous and make you sick — “it has a good safety record,” says Hardy, citing a review of studies published in 2021 in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies. Although the researchers found that the evidence for effectiveness was mixed, they concluded that the herb appeared to be a safe option for soothing upper respiratory symptoms. It’s easy to assume that anything as ubiquitous as elderberry — supplements are sold online and on store shelves — isn’t capable of doing serious harm. But doctors and public health professionals caution that’s not true, especially for people with chronic conditions. “Elderberry may overstimulate the immune system, which can worsen autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or multiple sclerosis, and it can react with certain medications or cause upset stomach,” says Maria Portela, M.D., associate professor at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences and chief of Family Medicine. If you have a high fever or a preexisting condition like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes, in addition to those mentioned above, talk to your doctor before taking any supplement. Another consideration: “Elderberry may help relieve symptoms, but it shouldn’t replace antiviral medications such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or baloxavir (Xofluza) for high-risk populations such as people who are immunocompromised,” Portela says. “Unlike elderberry, these medications have undergone rigorous clinical trials and are FDA-approved for influenza treatment,"" she says. If you take any type of medicine or supplement, you should also check with your doctor before trying elderberry. “Elderberry and other botanical supplements can interact with other medications or supplements and might have other side effects,” Cohen says. “In the case of elderberry, it might have a diuretic effect or make people a little dehydrated. But that effect is unpredictable because you can’t really know how much of the active ingredient is in the supplement. Because of the lack of standardization, you’re in a bind.” Shopping for supplements: What to look for If your doctor gives you the green light and you want to add elderberry to your cold and flu cabinet, some clues on the label can help you choose wisely, Hardy says. For instance, in addition to the common name (elderberry), look for the botanical name (Sambucus nigra) on the label. “If I picked up an herbal product and it had the common name but not the scientific name, I would put that product back,” Hardy says. In addition, she says, “a good label will also tell you which part of the plant was used (that should be the berry); how the product was managed (for instance, as crushed dried berry or as an extract); as well as how much of a marker compound is in that extract.” In herbal supplements, the quantity of a marker compound is a tip-off to the quality of the product. Although there are no guarantees that herbal supplements will live up to their claims or be side-effect-free, the following seals of approval offer some assurance that what’s on the label matches what’s in the product: USP (United States Pharmacopeia), NSF (NSF International), or CL (ConsumerLab.com). All of these indicate the product has been tested, audited and certified by an independent organization, “though it’s important to remember that doing so doesn’t guarantee a product’s safety,” Portela says. Bottom line: “Elderberry supplements may offer mild benefits in reducing the duration and severity of colds or flu,” Portela says. “It should not, however, replace flu vaccines, antiviral medications, or supportive treatments such as hydration and rest.” Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2024/cdc-spring-covid-vaccine.html,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by Why Adults 65-Plus Should Get a Spring COVID Shot Doctors and virus experts say many older adults will benefit from a mid-year boost By Rachel Nania, Updated March 06, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published February 29, 2024 / Updated March 06, 2025 Getty Images National data suggests the rough respiratory illness season may finally be winding down. Declining trends, however, shouldn’t be mistaken for lax precautions. Doctors and virus experts say it’s just about time for older adults to roll up their sleeves for another dose of the coronavirus vaccine. In October 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a recommendation that people ages 65 and older get a spring shot of the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine to boost their immune systems and restore protection that has waned since the fall, when the updated vaccines became available. Immunocompromised individuals — those who have cancer or take certain medications to treat an autoimmune disorder, for example — are also advised to get another COVID vaccine. “Those two groups are the ones that are now consistently making up the population that’s suffering from severe COVID-19, meaning emergency room visits or hospitalizations,” says Andrew Pekosz, a professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. In early January, the COVID hospitalization rate for adults younger than 50 was 1.0 per 100,000 people; for those 65-plus, it was 18.3 per 100,000. And during last year’s respiratory illness season, adults 65 and older accounted for 70 percent of all COVID-related hospitalizations. Why do older adults need a boost? A big reason has to do with age-related changes that make it more difficult for older adults to fight off an infection, explains Rachel M. Presti, M.D., a professor of medicine and medical director of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Unit at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. This is not unique to COVID-19. Older adults are more susceptible to severe illness from other bugs, such as influenza, which is why a high-dose version of the flu shot is recommended for people 65-plus. Additionally, the COVID vaccines “provide really pretty good protection in the short term, but by the time you get to month four, five and six, that protection begins to wane,” William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told AARP. And, unlike flu, which typically strikes during the fall and winter, COVID-19 is active year-round, which is why it has surged in the summer months. “So this six-month boost is meant to sort of kick that [immunity] back up to high levels of protection until the following fall,” Pekosz says, when people are typically vaccinated for flu and COVID-19. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. When should you get the COVID-19 vaccine? The recommendation from the CDC is for people age 65-plus to get the COVID-19 vaccine six months after their last dose. So, if you were vaccinated in September or October, you’re just about due for another. If you waited on the vaccine in the fall and got it more recently, however, you can still get another dose this spring. While the CDC advises a six-month stretch between the two shots, the agency says the minimum time is two months apart, “which allows flexibility to get the second dose prior to typical COVID-19 surges, travel, life events and health care visits.” Three different COVID-19 vaccines are available at pharmacies and health clinics, including an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech and a protein-based vaccine from Novavax. Less than a quarter of U.S. adults (about 23 percent) received the latest COVID-19 vaccine as of Feb. 22, federal data shows; an estimated 25 percent of adults 65 and older had received the shot as of November 2024, according to Medicare data. How effective is the COVID vaccine? The strains of coronavirus currently circulating have drifted from the variant the vaccines target. “But there have been a number of studies that show that the vaccine still does induce what we call cross-reactive antibodies and that it will recognize the currently circulating variants,” Pekosz says. “So it looks like it’s still effective,” Presti adds. Getting the vaccine this spring doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t catch COVID-19, but it does reduce the risk that you’ll experience severe illness if you get infected. “Thousands of people died of COVID-19 [in the past year], and the vast majority of them either haven’t been vaccinated or haven’t been vaccinated recently. So there certainly still is data that says that the vaccine is a safe and effective way to minimize severe disease,” Pekosz says. The COVID-19 vaccine can also help prevent the spread of the illness, Presti points out. “And that’s part of why vaccines are so effective,” she says. “It’s not just to protect you; it’s really to protect everyone around you as well because then, even if you get infected, you won’t transmit as much to other people, because you won’t be producing as much virus because your immune system will be able to clear it.” Heading into spring, it’s “still useful” to think of other ways to lower your chances of getting COVID-19, Presti adds. Wash your hands often, she says, and consider keeping a mask handy in case you’re out in public and people around you are coughing or sneezing. “It’s still a very legitimate way to protect yourself, in addition to getting the vaccine,” she says.

If your kidneys aren’t working properly, the amount of creatine in your blood builds up while the amount of it in your urine goes down. This process can go on for years before noticeable symptoms appear. By the time they do, kidney disease can be deadly. How to know if you’re at risk Your age, race, sex and race/ethnicity play a role in whether kidney disease is likely to affect you. Chronic kidney disease, for example, is 38 percent more common in those age 65 and older than in younger people, according to the Centers for Disease Co﻿ntrol and Prevention. It’s also only slightly more common in women than men, and slightly more common in Black adults than in ﻿white (16 percent to 13 percent, respectively)﻿. You’re also significantly more likely to have kidney disease if you’re a smoker﻿, are obese or have a family history of the condition. As for the greatest risk factors for the disease? Having long﻿-term﻿ high blood pressure or diabetes, both of which damage the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys. The relationship with your heart goes both ways. When your kidneys don’t work well, your heart needs to pump harder to increase blood flow through these small but important organs. And that extra effort takes a toll: Recent studies have found that chronic kidney disease can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease two- to fourfold, and heart disease and stroke are the major cause of death for people with kidney disease. Stages and disease progression If the bad news is that kidney disease kills more people than breast ﻿and prostate cancer combined, the good news is that it is a slow and progressive disease that can take decades to fully manifest. “Many people with kidney disease at an even moderate level have minimal to no progression﻿, and many people with progression will never reach the point of kidney failure requiring dialysis,” says Afshi﻿n Parsa, M﻿.D﻿., program director of the division of kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, M﻿aryland. Within the five stages of the disease, most people are diagnosed in stage ﻿3 or ﻿4, Parsa﻿ says. In the first and second stage﻿s of the disease, you may not have noticeable symptoms, but your blood work might show high levels of certain proteins in your urine as well as a slight decrease in your GFR, a standard age-adjusted measure of how well the organs are filtering waste. A typical GFR is around 90 in adults 50 to 69 years of age. During the third stage of chronic kidney disease﻿, your kidneys still work, but not as efficiently as they once did. The toxins that your kidneys would typically filter out of your body will start to build up and may cause swelling in your hands and feet, as well as changes in urination and anemia. By stage ﻿4, your kidneys become either moderately or severely damaged. You may have back pain, more swelling in your extremities, fatigue and trouble concentrating, as well as changes in your urination. Your GFR can plummet to between 15 and 29. When you reach the fifth stage, known as end stage renal failure, your kidneys lose the ability to effectively filter fluids, electrolytes and waste out of your body. Some of the symptoms include itchiness, muscle cramps, swelling in your extremities, insomnia, back pain and changes in urination, including foamy urine. You may also lose your appetite. While ﻿﻿an estimated 47 percent of those over the age 7﻿0﻿ have kidney disease, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins, it progresses to renal failure in only ﻿1 to ﻿2 percent of these patients, according to the National Kidney Foundation. At this stage, “people can live on dialysis for years,” Parsa ﻿says of the treatment that mechanically filters the blood and removes toxins. Prevention and treatments to know The best way to protect yourself against kidney disease is to maintain control of your blood pressure and blood sugar, Parsa says. In addition, studies ﻿show that following the Mediterranean diet, which focuses on eating fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, can help reduce your risk of kidney problems. If you already have advanced kidney disease, your doctor may ask you to restrict protein-rich foods, as well as food and drinks containing the minerals potassium, phosphorous and sodium, such as bananas. Until recently doctors have ﻿relied mainly on medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to slow the progression of kidney disease because they help relax veins and arteries﻿, resulting in lower blood pressure. Recent trials show that some newer diabetes medications, such as Jardiance, can be used in addition to ACE inhibitors to reduce the kidney disease risk in adults with type ﻿2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Kidney Damage After COVID-19 It’s been known for some time that not only can COVID-19 cause severe damage to the kidneys, but that chronic kidney disease increases the risk of more serious complications with the disease. (﻿One study of electronic health records showed that those with severe chronic kidney disease were almost 11 times ﻿as likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 ﻿as others﻿.) Now a new﻿, large study of U﻿.S﻿. ﻿veterans shows that additional damage may appear following an infection. In the study released in September, researchers found approximately twice the risk of acute kidney injury 30 days after infection as compared to non-COVID patients. Some of the damage has been reported to be caused by blood clots that clog blood vessels supplying the kidneys.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/foods-that-cause-bloating/,"7 Foods That Cause Belly Bloating How to change your diet to find relief, and learn when you need to seek treatment Lisa Nottingham / EyeEm By Denise Maher, Updated November 05, 2024 AARP En español Published March 27, 2023 / Updated November 05, 2024 Bloat sounds like it feels. Your belly swells, with gas and fluid pushing out from inside, making it feel as if you are wearing a heavy inner tube around your middle. Bloating, a sensation of fullness in your abdomen, is a tricky topic, says Lin Chang, M.D., vice-chief of the Division of Digestive Diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “Bloating is such a common symptom that can be associated with multiple different diseases or disorders,” she explains, that it is often not used in diagnostic criteria, as it doesn’t help distinguish one condition from another. What causes belly bloat? The root cause of your bloat could stem from various issues, or a combination of them, including a lack of fiber in your diet, a food intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or small intestine bacterial overgrowth, or a serious condition such as colon cancer. If you’ve already gotten the clear from a colonoscopy — recommended starting at age 45 — it is likely that this disagreeable symptom comes from a classic gastrointestinal problem. Constipation, one of the main reasons so many people experience gas and bloating, gets more common as you age. According to the American Gastroenterological Association, about 16 out of 100 adults experience constipation symptoms. After age 60, that number rises to 33 out of 100. Experts say there are a number of reasons digestive issues tend to plague more older people. “With age, we produce less stomach acid, which is responsible for activating certain enzymes that help break down foods,” says Sandra J. Arévalo Valencia, director of community health and wellness at Montefiore Nyack Hospital in Nyack, New York. “When these enzymes are not being activated and the food remains longer in the stomach, then there’s more gas that remains for a longer period of time in the digestive tract﻿,” she says. Every person is different, and not everyone will have trouble with every food, stresses Arévalo. But if you are curious about possible dietary causes of bloating, consider these seven types of food. 1. Milk, cheese or other dairy foods Developing lactose intolerance later in life is very common, says﻿ Arévalo. With age, we produce less and less of the enzyme we need to digest the lactose (a type of sugar) in milk, she explains. Besides bloating, dairy digestion problems can cause gas, pain and diarrhea. Luckily, there is an easy over-the-counter remedy. You can supplement the missing enzyme, lactase, with products such as Lactaid. 2. Beans, lentils, almonds, whole grains The high fiber content in legumes and some other foods can cause bloating and pain with digestion, notes Arévalo, who is also a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Chang suggests that her patients use a tool, like a spreadsheet or food diary, to help correlate consistent patterns of gastro symptoms with what they ate. Check out free digital app diet trackers like Cara Care, Symple Symptom Tracker or Low FODMAP diet A to Z that can help you connect foods with your bloating symptoms. Also helpful are such patient-friendly resources as the International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders and ﻿the Rome Foundation. Sharon Pruitt / EyeEm 3. Foods with artificial sweeteners Manufacturers use low-calorie sweeteners like sorbitol in foods and beverages to bring down the overall calorie count. But some sweeteners might not digest fully in the small intestine, leading to gas and bloating in the large intestine. More research is needed to learn how sweeteners affect GI function and the gut microbiome, according to Monash University, where researchers created the low FODMAP diet for people with IBS. Check the ingredients list for sweeteners such as sorbitol and mannitol. Gum and mints with warnings about excess consumption causing laxative effects are a good sign that the﻿ item is a sweetened food that may cause gastro symptoms. seksan Mongkhonkhamsao / getty images 4. Carbonated drinks, soda, sparkling water Some people cannot tolerate bubbles and carbonation, according to Arévalo. Others need to start drinking it gradually, to get their system used to the fizzy beverages. Sharon Pruitt / EyeEm seksan Mongkhonkhamsao / getty images 5. Beer Beer checks a lot of bloat boxes, notes Adrienna Jirik, M.D., a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Besides carbonation, it contains grains and gluten, which bother some people. And alcohol can disrupt digestion and interfere with healthy gut bacteria, ultimately leading to more gas production. Then, bingo! You’re bloated. 6. Broccoli, brussels sprouts, other cruciferous vegetables While they’re nutrient-rich, cruciferous vegetables are also chock-full of sulfurs and fiber that can pack a wicked punch of gas. Chang notes that there are new digestive enzyme supplements that claim to make it easier for your system to break down these foods, though their effectiveness remains to be proven. 7. Fruits you don’t eat often Like many fruits, apples, pears, berries and grapes are high in fructose and can trigger digestive issues, especially when added to a diet abruptly. When you aren’t used to eating fruit and your digestion isn’t as efficient as it used to be, food stays in the GI tract for longer, Arévalo says, causing more fermentation, gas production and consequent bloating. She says she sees this when people newly diagnosed with prediabetes, high cholesterol or high blood pressure are told to eat more fruits and vegetables. “If they don’t already consume fruit regularly, their bodies react badly at first,” she explains. Introduce new fruits slowly and add no sugar low-fat yogurt to your diet to help your gut tolerate them. When to seek treatment If you suspect your belly bloat is related to diet, you can track what you eat using a food and symptom diary to pinpoint which foods are problematic for you. See a doctor if bloating is bothersome or getting worse. Besides lifestyle changes, such as adding exercise and drinking more fluids, there are many treatments available, notes Chang, who is also a fellow of the American College of Gastroenterology. “There’s prescription medicines, over-the-counter remedies, GI behavioral therapies, like gut-directed hypnotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapies, that reduce abdominal symptoms,” she offers.﻿ Editor's note: This article, first published March 27, 2023, has been updated with new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/processed-foods-cognitive-decline/,"Are Processed Foods Bad for Your Brain? Eating lots of salty, sugary and high-fat snacks could impact your memory after midlife By Rachel Nania, Updated January 17, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published August 10, 2022 / Updated January 17, 2025 Getty Images If you’re looking to keep your brain healthy as you age, you may want to lay off the packaged pastries for breakfast, hot dogs for lunch and ice cream in the evening. Accumulating research suggests that a diet chock-full of highly processed foods could contribute to worsening brain health. Most recently, an observational study published in the journal Neurology found that people who eat about two weekly servings of processed red meat — bacon, bologna, salami, hot dogs, etc. — are more likely to develop dementia than those who eat significantly less, about three servings a month. The researchers also found that swapping a serving of the processed meats for a serving of nuts, beans or tofu may lower the risk of dementia by 20 percent. One possible explanation: “[Processed red meat] may affect the brain because it has high levels of harmful substances such as nitrites (preservatives) and sodium,” study co-author Yuhan Li said in a news release when the research was first presented at the 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference. A study published in 2024 in the journal Neurology found that adults 45 and older who recorded a higher intake of ultraprocessed foods — foods high in sugar, fat and salt, and low in protein and fiber — had a greater risk for cognitive decline and stroke, while those who kept to a minimally processed diet saw a decreased risk for both conditions. The association was especially pronounced among Black participants: Black adults who ate more ultraprocessed foods had a 15 percent increase in their risk of stroke. What’s more, research presented at the 2022 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference found that people who consumed the highest amounts of ultraprocessed foods (more than 20 percent of their daily caloric intake) saw a faster decline in memory, planning and organizational skills over a span of several years, compared with those with lower consumption. “There are a lot of studies that have already shown that eating [healthy] is good for your heart, but we’re starting to see trends that eating a heart-healthy diet may also be good for your brain,” says Rebecca Edelmayer, vice president of scientific engagement for the Alzheimer’s Association. The food-brain relationship Many foods that line the grocery store shelves are considered processed. For example, bagged salads go through minimal processing; so do cans of beans and boxes of frozen vegetables. But the types of foods that these studies looked at “really go through a significant industrial process and contain large quantities of fats, sugars, salt, artificial flavors and colors, even stabilizers and preservatives,” Edelmayer says. Most live in the center aisles of the grocery store, not the fresh and refrigerated sections along the perimeter. And when it comes to their potential impact on brain health, it’s important to remember that “the whole body is interconnected,” says Stephanie Kim Nothelle, M.D., a geriatrician and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who was not involved in the aforementioned studies. The brain is a highly vascular organ, Nothelle explains, and everything we eat gets absorbed into the bloodstream. “And so if you’re eating something that’s really high in fat, or really high in salt, or really high in sugar, those things are going to be distributed throughout the body and have effects everywhere, including the brain,” Nothelle says. Research shows that people with certain health conditions that can be influenced by a bad diet — heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, for example — are more likely to experience cognitive decline as they age. These are also risk factors for stroke. Another thing to consider: It may not be what you’re eating when you devour a packaged snack but what you’re not eating when you choose that highly processed option over, say, a piece of fruit, points out Paul Jacques, a senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging and a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “There’s a lot of things in [whole] foods — a lot of phytochemicals, polyphenols — that have been associated with brain health that aren’t going to be found in most ultraprocessed foods,” he says. These brain-boosting compounds are “hard to avoid” if you’re eating a mostly plant-based, Mediterranean-style diet. You can find them in berries, onions, apples, leafy greens, nuts and seeds. Fish is another food that research has shown may benefit the brain. “The important thing [to think about] is what are the ultraprocessed foods replacing,” Jacques says. “It’s really looking at your overall diet and seeing what’s in it.” And know that a handful of blueberries once a week won’t offset a steady stream of fast food, he adds. Healthy habits can help your brain It’s hard to avoid ultraprocessed foods; they’re stocked in nearly every store, and there’s no denying their convenience. Plus, for many people, access to fresh, healthy food isn’t always an option. But if you’re looking to cut down on the amount of highly processed foods you’re eating, Nothelle says to choose single-ingredient foods when you can, like an apple, a chicken breast or a bowl of whole grains. “You know what is in them, versus some packaged product where when you look at the back, the ingredient list is like 100 different items long, half [of them] you can’t even pronounce or don’t know what they are,” she says. Also, don’t overthink it. If you stick to a diet that’s good for your heart, the latest research suggests your brain will also reap the benefits. “Sometimes people drive themselves crazy about this sort of stuff, but hopefully having a balanced perspective will help,” Nothelle says. The Alzheimer’s Association’s Edelmayer says the mounting research linking diet and brain health strengthens the notion that there are everyday things individuals can do to reduce their risk of dementia — and that’s “exciting,” she adds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nearly 40 percent of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias may be prevented or delayed with the adoption of certain habits, like a healthy diet and regular exercise. “There will be some more research that’s needed to come up with the most sustainable and evidence-supported strategy for individuals, but I think when we look at the future of treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, it’s going to include strategies like ... the incorporation of healthy habits into one’s lifestyle but also the ability to have access to really powerful medicines to effectively treat Alzheimer’s and other dementias,” Edelmayer says. Two medications have received full federal approval for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, which is the most common form of dementia, and several potential therapies are being studied in clinical trials.

Not helping matters: When it’s chilly out, people spend more time inside, speaking, coughing and breathing close to each other. Winter’s drier air also gives germs an assist by allowing them to travel farther and survive longer than in warmer, more humid conditions. Each year, millions of Americans come down with the flu; even more catch a cold, often multiple times, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Still, myths about causes and cures persist. ﻿Here’s what’s true — and what isn’t. ﻿ Myth 1: Being cold makes you catch a cold. Going outside in cold weather without a jacket﻿ or, say, with wet hair — will that make you catch a cold? Actually, no. This one is a myth. “Just getting cold doesn’t lead to illness,” says James Conway, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health who serves as medical director of its immunization program. “It just happens to be a coincidence that people get sick during cold weather when they’re around cold, drafty conditions. But there’s really no relation whatsoever.” That said, if you’re already sick, being out in the cold might keep you sicker for longer. “If your body is fighting off a cold, and then you compound it with the stress of trying to stay warm, it may affect the recovery period of getting over a cold,” says Lilly Immergluck, M.D., a professor of microbiology, biochemistry and immunology at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. So even though being cold won’t make you catch a cold, it is true that frigid temperatures tax your immune system, because your body must work harder to maintain its typical temperature. Myth 2: Load up on vitamin C and zinc to get better, faster. Taking large doses of vitamin C won’t help prevent a cold, and there’s really “no solid evidence” that it will decrease the severity of cold and flu symptoms or even shorten the duration of the illness, Conway says. Though some physically active adults might benefit from some extra vitamin C, a meta-analysis that studied over 11,000 people found that taking vitamin C supplements for the common cold “is not justified” for the general population because therapeutic trials haven’t replicated the link that some studies have found. Still, “it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial for them,” the authors stated. Just be sure to check with your doctor before doing so. Most people get enough vitamin C from their diets, and dietary supplements, while sold over the counter, are not risk﻿-free. Some can cause side effects and may interact with other medications. For example, vitamin C may reduce the effectiveness of some statins and blood thinners. Zinc’s efficacy as a treatment for cold and flu symptoms also isn’t supported by scientific research. Studies that evaluated the efficacy of zinc lozenges and syrups found mixed results. If you feel better after dissolving an over-the-counter zinc or vitamin C powder into a glass of water, thank that glass of water — it’s good hydration. Myth 3: Chicken soup will cure a cold. The idea that chicken soup is good for the soul may not be grounded in science, but the placebo effect is. That is, in some limited cases, believing something will work can make it work. So if you feel a sense of warm nostalgia — good vibes — from sipping a bowl of soup, that may make you feel better, subjectively. Whether this soup actually helps you recover is a different matter. One popular study published in the journal Chest conducted more than two decades ago by University of Nebraska Medical Center researcher Stephen Rennard, M.D., and his wife, Barbara Rennard, among others, put Barbara’s grandmother’s recipe — a brew full of fresh vegetables — to the test. The study found that certain types of chicken soup, including the homemade recipe, had a mild anti-inflammatory effect on the blood of healthy volunteers. The researchers said the soup might help improve cold symptoms because something in it — they couldn’t figure out what, exactly — restrained the movement of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that fights infection.﻿ The reduced movement of the neutrophils “may reduce activity in the upper respiratory tract that can cause symptoms associated with a cold,” explains a news release that accompanied the study. ﻿ This effect was modest, the authors noted in a more recent article, also published in Chest, and the study was not a clinical trial, so “no conclusions could be drawn about clinical effect, either good or bad,” the authors said. “The nutritional benefits from chicken soup in accelerating the recovery from a cold are probably minimal,” Immergluck says. That said, soup can soothe a sore throat. And breathing in a soup’s steam — taking in a big breath, then letting that aroma linger — can, if only for a moment, help clear out the gunk that’s lodged in your nose and throat. Moisture is what helps here, so try a nice cup of tea. A steamy shower or bath can do the trick — or essentially anything that works like a humidifier. And since soups are mostly liquid, they do help you stay hydrated. Getting enough liquids is especially important when you have a fever, because a fever leads to what the medical community calls “increased insensible losses.” Since you sweat more and “breathe out more fluid,” Conway says, “it’s easier to get dehydrated when you’re sick and when you have a fever.” Myth 4: Feed a cold, starve a fever — or vice versa. Whichever version you’ve heard, “starving” while you're sick — whether it’s a fever or a cold — isn’t something that most doctors would recommend. If you don’t eat enough, it’s more difficult to keep hydrated. “It’s never a good idea to have bad nutrition and to deprive yourself, especially when you’re sick. It’s really important to try to eat reasonably well, even if you don’t feel well,” Conway says. What’s even more important, he adds, is staying hydrated. Can VapoRub Vanquish a Cold? While Vicks VapoRub and similar products may ease some cold and flu symptoms, they “are unlikely to accelerate the recovery period from illness,” Immergluck says. These products contain camphor — which is “known to work as a mild analgesic,” Immergluck adds — plus menthol, which causes a cooling sensation, and eucalyptus, an essential oil that “may have cough suppressant properties.” Though “studies have shown that over-the-counter menthol-containing medications have some benefit on reducing cough in children,” Immergluck says, “there are also reports that ‘too much’ or prolonged use of oral menthol (found in some cough lozenges) may have the opposite effect of prolonging or aggravating a persistent cough.” (Note: The Food and Drug Administration does not recommend over-the-counter medicines for cough and cold symptoms in children younger than 2 ﻿“because they could cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.﻿”) If you do use a topical camphor product, be sure to avoid putting it in or around the nostrils — especially a small child’s nostrils ﻿— Mayo Clinic warns, as it can be harmful if absorbed through the mucous membranes. It can also injure the cornea if it gets in the eye. Editor’s note: This story, first published Dec. 8, 2022, has been updated. Can VapoRub Vanquish a Cold?

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/dry-eyes-relief-treatment/,"7 Tips for Treating Dry Eyes Find relief from the pain, burning and redness, and get your tears back By Michelle Crouch, Updated October 09, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published July 22, 2021 / Updated October 09, 2023 KYLE ELLINGSON Eye Drops Recall The Food and Drug Administration recalled several brands of eye drops this year due to bacterial outbreaks and other contaminants. Find out more here. We wouldn’t blame you if the recent bacterial outbreak linked to several brands of over-the-counter eye drops has stopped you from using them. The news last winter was scary: Dozens of people were infected by the drug-resistant bacteria, including at least four patients who died and others who were blinded. Though the tainted products were recalled, they left behind uncertainty and hesitation.﻿ But eye experts would urge you to reconsider. “I definitely still recommend eye drops every day and take them myself for dry eye,” says Christopher Starr, M.D., a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine. The fact is, eye drops are one of the most effective remedies for dry eye. For a mild case, over-the-counter eye drops may be all you need, although your eye doctor can offer more treatment options. Here’s your step-by-step guide to getting relief. Take dry eyes seriously When your eyes are working correctly, they will constantly produce tears that keep the surface of the eye moist and comfortable. When you have dry eye, you either don’t produce enough tears or your tears evaporate too quickly because your oil glands are clogged. Left untreated, dry eye can lead to an infection, damage to your cornea or vision loss. An eye doctor can diagnose what’s causing your symptoms. Getty Images Common Causes of Dry Eye Medications, such as antidepressants, blood pressure drugs and sleep aids Laser, or refractive, eye surgery Age-related hormonal changes, including menopause Autoimmune conditions Contact lenses Clogged ducts Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke 1. Try eye drops and ointments Look for eye drops that say “lubrication” or “artificial tears,” not “redness relief.” Ointments and gels provide longer relief, but use only at night since they can blur vision. If you need drops more than four times a day, switch to preservative-free ones that come in single-use vials, or see your doctor for prescription drops.

Take a tech break When you use a computer or tablet, position the screen below eye level, take frequent breaks and try to remember to blink. Research shows you blink about 66 percent less than normal when you’re staring at a screen. Many doctors recommend stepping away every 20 minutes. 3. Unblock your oil glands Gently scrub lids and lashes with a mild cleanser twice a day. Getty Images Ducts along the edges of your eyelids generate oils to keep your tears from evaporating too fast. To help keep them flowing, wash your eyelids gently with baby shampoo or an eyelid cleanser, then lay a warm, moist washcloth on your eyes for a few minutes and lightly massage your eyelids. For stubborn cases, a doctor can perform an in-office procedure that uses heat or pulsed light to unblock glands. 4. Adapt your home environment A humidifier adds moisture to dry indoor air. Put one near your favorite chair and one near your bed when you sleep (keep the door shut), says Uyen Tran, M.D., a division chief at the Vanderbilt Eye Institute. Gently scrub lids and lashes with a mild cleanser twice a day. Getty Images 5. Move away from blowing air Air blowing into your eyes irritates your eyeballs and can cause tears to evaporate more quickly. A ceiling fan can dry out your eyes even while you sleep, Starr says. Point car vents away from your face, and move furniture you use often away from home HVAC vents. Throw on some wraparound sunglasses if you go outside on a windy day. 6. Try a different type of contact lens In most cases, contact lenses make dry eye worse. But ask your doctor about scleral lenses, which can help keep dry eyes hydrated, Tran says. “They have a water reservoir, so when you wear them, they constantly bathe your eyes in fluid.” 7. Get your ducts plugged A doctor can place “punctal plugs” into the tiny openings in the corner of your eye that normally drain your tears, a painless office procedure. “It’s like putting the stopper in the kitchen sink, so the tears you make don’t roll down the drain,” Tran says. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications. Her work has appeared in Reader’s Digest, Real Simple, Prevention, The Washington Post and The New York Times.","The article addresses the central theme of treating dry eyes, providing relief from symptoms, and restoring tear production. The key findings and recommendations include using eye drops and ointments, taking regular breaks from screens, unblocking oil glands, adapting the home environment, and considering alternative contact lenses or punctal plugs. A novel insight is that certain contact lenses, such as scleral lenses with a water reservoir, can help keep dry eyes hydrated, contrary to the common understanding that contact lenses exacerbate dry eye.",278

Heck, I love dessert, period. And I actually eat it a lot more often than one would guess. I'm very careful that my meals do not contain hidden sugars (did you know that 2 tablespoons of bottled salad dressing can have more than a cookie?) so I can enjoy desserts without exceeding recommended daily allowances for sugar overall. I know I'm not alone in craving chocolate and sweets and just baking more in general as we stay safely home these days. Instead of following a super fattening recipe that could really set you back, I hope you'll try one of these. Chocolate Not-Only-In-Your-Dreams Cake I dreamed of eating a rich, flourless chocolate cake like this for years; I'm one of those “There's no such thing as chocolate cake that's too rich” types. Even when dieting, I have to “cheat” with chocolate from time to time just to keep my sanity. And then came this cake. It's as rich as they come, and I love it more than any other ﬂourless chocolate espresso cake I've had. Plus, it packs 6 grams of ﬁber, so it really is guilt free! If you want to impress your friends (when you're able to see them) or if you're in quarantine alone, store some in the freezer, unbaked, in the ramekins placed within an airtight container. When you need a no-fuss dessert, pop the ramekins in a glass pan filled with some water, as described below, and bake for 30 to 32 minutes. Ingredients Butter-ﬂavored cooking spray1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce1 teaspoon vanilla extract4 large egg whites1 cup dark or light brown sugar (not packed)3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1/4 teaspoon very ﬁnely ground espresso beans (or 1/2 teaspoon instant coffee)1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon powdered sugar, optional4 raspberries, optionalFour 3 1/2 -inch-diameter ramekins (or any small souffle dishes or heat-proof bowls that are a least a few inches tall) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously mist four 3 1/2 -inch-diameter ramekins with spray. Place them side by side in an 8-by-8-inch baking pan. Add water to the pan until it reaches halfway to the top of the ramekins. Use a sturdy whisk or spatula to mix the applesauce, vanilla, egg whites and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl until well combined. Add the cocoa powder, espresso and salt. Stir until just combined and no lumps remain. Divide evenly among the ramekins (each ramekin will be about two-thirds full). Bake for 21 to 24 minutes, until the tops look silky and puff slightly and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out a bit wet (do not cook them long enough for the toothpick to come out dry). Remove from the oven and carefully transfer the ramekins from the water in the baking pan to a cooling rack. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Then invert each ramekin onto a dessert plate. Let stand for 1 minute, and then slowly lift off the ramekin (the cakes should come out on their own; if they don't, run a knife around the edge of the cakes to loosen them). Cool for another 5 to 10 minutes. Use a ﬁne sieve to evenly dust each cake with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar, if desired. Place one raspberry on the center of each cake, if using.

This corn bread requires only basic ingredients, and no mixer. It's excellent for breakfast, lunch or dinner with your favorite pot of low-fat chili. Ingredients Butter-flavored cooking spray (or canola or avocado oil spray)3/4 cup yellow corn meal1 1/4 cup unbleached flour2 teaspoons baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 cup fat-free vanilla yogurt (use any vanilla or plain yogurt; if using plain, add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)4 egg whites, lightly beaten (use 2 whole eggs if you're “conserving” and don't mind the extra fat/calories)3/4 cup sugar3/4 cup skim milk (or any nondairy milk you have on hand)1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract1 tablespoon butter, melted1 small jalapeno cut into thin rounds, if desired Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Mist an 8-by-8-inch nonstick baking pan or baking dish with spray. Courtesy Devin Alexander In a medium bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. Set it aside. In a large bowl, using a sturdy whisk or spoon, mix the yogurt, egg whites and sugar until they are just blended. Mix in the milk, vanilla and shortening. Then add the dry ingredients and stir them in until they are just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place the jalapeno rounds evenly over top, if using. Bake the bread for approximately 28 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with some sticky crumbs attached (because of the low fat content, it won't be “dry” until it's overcooked — it should be sticky, but not wet). Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Cut into 10 equal pieces. Serve warm or store in an airtight plastic container in the refrigerator or freezer to eat later.

Mitch Mandel Naked Apple Tart In culinary school, I used to make a tart very similar to this one, only it had a crust with enough butter to require a week of working out! Now, I enjoy it naked — without a crust, that is. I prefer the look of this “tart” when it's baked in a round or oval dish. You can use a similar-size square or rectangle dish, if necessary. Note that the tart cooks for quite a while, allowing the apples to transform into layers of soft, sweet deliciousness. The top of the tart will start to look burnt, but don't worry, it's not. It's just the result of juice and cinnamon caramelizing onto the apples — oh, so sweet! Ingredients Butter-flavored cooking spray (or canola oil or avocado oil spray)2 large crisp apples (such as Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Pink Lady or Honey Crisp), peeled3/4 cup 100 percent apple juice (not from concentrate)2 tablespoons coconut sugar (or substitute unpacked light or dark brown sugar)2 teaspoons unsalted butter, melted (salted will work)1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly mist a 10-inch ceramic or glass tart dish with cooking spray. Cut the apples in half lengthwise and remove the cores. Slice each half lengthwise into very thin slices. Starting from the outer edges of the dish, arrange the apple slices, laying them horizontally, in tightly overlapping circles in the bottom of the dish, until all of the apple slices are used (they will make a rose or flower blossom pattern). In a small bowl, whisk together the apple juice, sugar, butter and cinnamon until well combined (the sugar and cinnamon will not dissolve completely). Pour half of the apple juice mixture evenly over the apples. Reserve the remaining half. Bake for 30 minutes. Pour the reserved mixture evenly over the apples. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer, or until the apples are very tender and the glaze has caramelized on the top and around the edges of the tart (it should look almost burnt — dark brown, but not blackened). Cool for 5 minutes, then divide among 4 serving plates or dishes and serve. Makes 4 servings.

Pecan Praline Cookie Thins When my Facebook friends learned that I was working on an all-dessert book, I immediately got inundated with requests for re-creating favorite high-cal classics. One of the most popular requests was for pecan pie. These scrumptious cookies, which are ridiculously low in fat and calories compared to pecan pie, are an ode to those requests. Note: Packages of pecans that say either “dry-toasted” or “dry-roasted” are perfect for this recipe. Just make sure the pecans are not raw — the cookies won't have as much flavor. Mitch Mandel Ingredients Butter-flavored cooking spray1 large egg white2 tablespoons coconut sugar (unpacked light or dark brown sugar works too)1/3 cup unsalted dry-toasted finely chopped pecans (finely chopped walnuts if you don't have them) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously mist 8 cups of a nonstick standard muffin tin with spray. Whisk together the egg white and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the pecans and stir until well combined. Spoon the batter (about a scant 1 tablespoon each) into the prepared muffin tin, making sure to distribute the pecans evenly between each muffin cup. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly crisped around the edges, being careful not to burn them. Cool the tin on a rack for 5 minutes, or until the cookies have cooled slightly. Remove them to a cooling rack and let them cool completely. Serve immediately or store in a cookie tin for up to 5 days. Makes 4 servings.

Lemon–Poppy Seed Mini-Muffins If you're like me and have an undying sweet tooth, these muffins are the perfect solution. Though I tend to eat them for breakfast after I've “been good” and had an egg white omelet, they're actually perfect for any time of the day. They're tiny, yet satisfying.

Mist 20 cups of a mini-muffin tin with spray. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the flour for about 1 minute, or until it is the consistency of all-purpose flour with no coarse grains remaining. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Sift the mixture twice. (If you don't have a sifter, put the mixture in a fine sieve and just tap it with your hand over a bowl until it's “sifted"") In a medium mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, egg whites, honey, vanilla extract and lemon extract with a sturdy whisk or spatula until well mixed. Stir in the reserved flour mixture until just combined. Stir in the lemon peel and poppy seeds (or nuts). Spoon the batter into the 20 prepared muffin cups. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of one muffin comes out sticky (not at all wet, but sticky crumbs are OK). Cool in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes, then remove the muffins to the rack. Makes 20 mini-muffins.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/medications-that-harm-liver/,"10 Medications That Can Harm the Liver Your liver works hard to keep your body healthy, but certain medications may put it at risk By Goldina Erowele, AARP Reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published February 05, 2025 Pete Ryan Your liver is one of the hardest working organs in your body. It cleans your blood, helps digest food and keeps you healthy. But did you know that some common medications can make your liver sick? It’s a condition known as drug-induced liver injury, explains Udoka Ikezuagu, M.D., a hospitalist at Loma Linda University Medical Center in Murrieta, California. And while most medications are safe when taken as directed, older adults can be more sensitive to these risks, so it’s important to be aware and bring any concerns to your healthcare provider. Older individuals are also more likely to take multiple medications — roughly 40 percent of people 65 and older regularly take five or more prescription drugs, a Lown Institute report found — raising the risk of stress and damage to the liver. Here are 10 medications that in some instances can hurt the liver, plus ways to help protect it from damage. 1. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) What it is: Acetaminophen is a popular over-the-counter (OTC) medication for treating mild to moderate pain and reducing fever. Common names: Tylenol, Paracetamol (internationally) How it affects the liver: Acetaminophen is safe if you follow the directions and take the recommended amount, but it’s easy to overdo it, since it’s found in many combination medications, such as cold and flu remedies. Taking too much acetaminophen for a headache or muscle ache can be hard on your liver and cause harm. This risk goes up if you drink alcohol or already have a history of liver problems. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Always follow the label and don’t take more than the recommended amount. (According to the manufacturer, the daily dose limit is 3,250 milligrams (mg) for adults. However, some doctors may allow up to 4,000 mg per day.) Be sure to read the list of ingredients on all OTC medications, and talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist before using acetaminophen if you drink alcohol or have liver problems. 2. Statins What they are: Statins are prescription medications that lower cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease. Common names: Atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor) How they affect the liver: While generally safe and well tolerated, statins can raise liver enzymes, in particular one called ALT, or alanine aminotransferase. However, increases less than three times the upper limit of normal may not require your doctor to stop statin use. And enzyme levels go back to normal once you stop the medication. In rare cases, they can cause serious liver problems, especially if you already have issues with your liver. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Your healthcare provider may order blood tests to check your liver function while you take statins — not everyone requires one — and, if needed, make any necessary changes. Common blood tests to check liver function include: AST (aspartate aminotransferase): Normal range is 8 to 33 U/LALT (alanine aminotransferase): Normal range is 4 to 36 U/LALP (alkaline phosphatase): Normal range is 44 to 147 IU/LBilirubin: Normal range of total bilirubin is 0.1 to 1.2 mg/dL 3. Amoxicillin-clavulanate What it is: Amoxicillin-clavulanate, an antibiotic, treats a variety of bacterial infections. Common names: Augmentin How it affects the liver: Amoxicillin-clavulanate can sometimes harm the liver. Though the exact cause is unclear, research suggests it’s likely due to an allergic reaction caused by clavulanate. Liver problems can occur a few days to weeks after starting the medicine or even after finishing it. The risk increases with prolonged use and existing liver problems. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Watch out for yellow skin or eyes (jaundice), tiredness or dark-colored urine. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately. 4. Antiseizure medications What they are: These medications are used to prevent and treat seizures and certain types of nerve pain. Common names: Phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Tegretol) How they affect the liver: Antiseizure medications such as phenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) can prompt an abnormal immune response in the liver, called hypersensitivity syndrome, which can damage nearby tissues. Medications like valproic acid (Depakene) and lamotrigine (Lamictal), can also affect the liver. Tips to lower your risk of injury: If you are prescribed these medications, your healthcare provider may perform blood tests to check your liver health. Depending on test results, your provider may adjust your dose or switch you to a different medication. 5. Methotrexate What it is: Methotrexate is a prescription drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. Common names: Trexall, Rheumatrex How it affects the liver: Methotrexate can harm the liver, especially if taken for a long time or at high doses. (People taking the drug short-term may not be affected.) It may cause liver inflammation and, over time, lead to scarring (fibrosis) or serious liver disease (cirrhosis). The risk increases if you drink alcohol or already have liver problems. Tips to lower your risk of injury: If prescribed, your healthcare provider may test your liver with blood work and adjust your medication if needed. Discuss your treatment plan with your doctor, and avoid alcohol while taking this medication. 6. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) What they are: NSAIDs are over-the-counter medications used to treat pain, inflammation and fever. Common names: Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren) How they affect the liver: NSAIDs are usually safe for short-term use. However, taking them for a long time or at higher doses can put stress on the liver and, in some cases, cause liver damage. People with liver conditions or those taking multiple medications that affect liver function are at higher risk. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Before using NSAIDs, check with your healthcare provider. They may recommend starting with the lowest dose for the shortest time or may suggest an alternative. 7. Certain herbal and dietary supplements What they are: Herbal and dietary supplements are often marketed for various health benefits, but some can cause damage to the liver. Kava and black cohosh are two examples. Common names: Kava (Piper methysticum), black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) How they affect the liver: Kava is used for anxiety and insomnia and has been associated with serious liver damage, though the exact cause is unclear. Black cohosh, often used for menopause symptoms, has been linked to liver problems such as a rise in liver enzymes and liver failure. More than 30 cases of liver injury linked to these supplements have been reported in the U.S. Because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate or approve herbal or dietary supplements in the same way it does with other medications, ingredients in marketed products can vary, and some may contain harmful substances. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Be a savvy consumer and know that “natural” doesn’t always mean safe. Always talk to your doctor before using supplements, and avoid using these supplements if you have existing liver problems. 8. Antifungal medications What they are: Antifungals are a class of medications used to treat fungal infections in the skin, lungs and nails. Common names: Fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral) How they affect the liver: Antifungal medications like fluconazole and ketoconazole can harm the liver, but keep in mind these medications are often prescribed for short-term use. The effects can range from a mild rise in liver enzymes (which is generally not concerning and can be monitored), to inflammation and even liver failure in rare cases. Watch out for yellowing skin or eyes, tiredness or dark urine. Tips to lower your risk of injury: If you notice these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately. They may order blood tests and, if necessary, adjust your medication. 9. Amiodarone What it is: Amiodarone is a prescription for treating and preventing life-threatening irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). Common names: Cordarone, Pacerone How it affects the liver: Amiodarone can damage the liver, affecting up to 1 percent of people who take it every year. It can raise liver enzyme levels or, in rare cases, lead to liver scarring. The FDA has issued a boxed warning about the risk of liver injury with this medication. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Your healthcare provider will check liver enzyme levels before starting the medication and during treatment. 10. Isoniazid What it is: Isoniazid is an antibiotic used for treating tuberculosis (TB) and, in some cases, preventing it. Common names: INH, Nydrazid, Rifater How it affects the liver: Isoniazid is broken down by the liver and can cause liver damage. It causes mild inflammation to serious liver injury — especially in older adults, those with liver conditions, or those who drink alcohol. It also has an FDA-boxed warning about liver inflammation risk, particularly when combined with certain medications. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Your healthcare provider may check the health of your liver with lab tests. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience nausea, vomiting, yellow skin or eyes, or dark urine. Risk factors for liver damage Some factors can raise the risk of liver damage from medications, including: A history of liver issuesFrequent alcohol useTaking multiple medications Working closely with your healthcare provider and pharmacist can help protect your liver. They may check your liver health and adjust your treatment if needed, says Jessica Njoku, a pharmacist with Harris Health System in Houston. To help protect your liver, take your medications exactly as prescribed, Ikezuagu says, and never change your dose without talking to your healthcare provider first. What’s more, be sure to talk to your doctor before mixing prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and supplements.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eye-health-tips-pandemic/,"8 Tips for Vision Health During the Pandemic Here’s how to protect yourself at a time that fewer people are going to the eye doctor By Jessica Migala, AARP Comments En español Published January 11, 2021 Peter Schaefer / EyeEm / Getty Images The pandemic hasn’t been good for our eyesight. It’s not just the amount of time we spend staring at computer screens. As we pared back our doctor visits, eye care was one of the first priorities to be slashed: There were an estimated 44 percent fewer ophthalmology visits and procedures done in 2020 than in 2019 — one of the biggest dips for any medical subspecialty, according to analysis from Strata Decision Technology. That’s a potential problem. “The eyes are built to last a long time,” says Stephen Christiansen, M.D., chief of ophthalmology at Boston Medical Center. But they need care. So as the global COVID-19 crisis heads into its second year, here are some steps you can take today to protect your eyes and equip your home in a vision-friendly way. By the Front Door 1. Comfortable walking shoes. Keep it moving, people. Low to moderate exercise for as little as three hours per week is associated with as much as a 41 percent lower likelihood of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), according to a meta-analysis in the American Journal of Ophthalmology. In addition, a study of those diagnosed with glaucoma showed that taking an extra 5,000 steps a day slows the rate of vision loss by 10 percent. Exercise reduces your risks of high blood pressure and diabetes, diseases that damage blood vessels that nourish the eyes, which can eventually compromise your vision or lead to blindness. COVID-19 and Your Eyes SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, typically infects you via your mouth and nose, but your eyes might also be a portal. Research has found that viral particles can land on the conjunctiva (the clear tissue covering the white part of your eye) and begin to replicate. “In a small proportion of patients, conjunctivitis — pink eye — can be one of the earliest signs of COVID-19,” explains ophthalmologist Stephen Christiansen, M.D. Be on the lookout for associated symptoms, like a fever. And be careful around others; tears themselves can be infected with the coronavirus. After blotting your eyes, properly dispose of any tissues and, yes, wash your hands (again). If you’re at especially high risk, or if you’re entering a high-risk area such as a hospital, it might be worthwhile to invest in a pair of protective goggles; be sure to wash them after use. 2. A great pair of sunglasses. UV light from the sun can damage the proteins in the lens of the eye, contributing to cataract formation. You need protection — even in January. COVID-19 and Your Eyes SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, typically infects you via your mouth and nose, but your eyes might also be a portal. Research has found that viral particles can land on the conjunctiva (the clear tissue covering the white part of your eye) and begin to replicate. “In a small proportion of patients, conjunctivitis — pink eye — can be one of the earliest signs of COVID-19,” explains ophthalmologist Stephen Christiansen, M.D. Be on the lookout for associated symptoms, like a fever. And be careful around others; tears themselves can be infected with the coronavirus. After blotting your eyes, properly dispose of any tissues and, yes, wash your hands (again). If you’re at especially high risk, or if you’re entering a high-risk area such as a hospital, it might be worthwhile to invest in a pair of protective goggles; be sure to wash them after use. “Wear sunglasses in the summer and winter, whether it’s cloudy or sunny, even in the car,” advises Stephanie Marioneaux, M.D., clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). Choose the right ones by buying a pair with “100% UV” or “UV400” protection, according to the sticker on the lens. You’ll find them at all prices. “I’ve even seen these at discount dollar stores,” she says. The AAO also recommends oversize sunglasses for maximum coverage. If you wear glasses but don’t want to buy a separate pair of prescription sunglasses, a money-saving option is clip-on shades that attach to your existing frame. These can be purchased online for as little as $25. In the Garage and Yard 3. Sturdy safety goggles. Whether you’re drilling or sawing, or just mowing your lawn, you’ll want to wear eye protection, notes Rachel Bishop, M.D., a staff clinician at the National Eye Institute. “It doesn’t take much — a shard of metal or a wood splinter — to lodge in your eye and cause an injury that could have been entirely avoidable.” Make it a habit to pop on a pair of well-fitting safety goggles or protective glasses when doing this kind of work, inside or out. In the Bedroom 4. Amsler eye chart. While an at-home test isn’t a substitute for an in-person comprehensive eye exam, you can use it to monitor how your eyes are doing. This chart is a grid with a black dot in the center. “The Amsler grid is an extremely helpful tool for patients with age-related macular degeneration,” notes Paras Shah, M.D., an ophthalmologist with NorthShore University HealthSystem in Glenview, Illinois. AMD is one of the leading causes of vision loss, and it has no cure. But with proper treatment, its progress can be significantly slowed. Taking the at-home “test” can help you detect if there’s a change in one eye; you can alert your doctor accordingly. The chart is available at macular.org/amsler-chart. 5. Snellen eye chart. The Snellen chart is the good old eye chart that you know and love. The AAO website (aao.org) provides a chart for adults, plus how-to instructions. After printing it out, hang it on a wall with no windows. Sitting 10 feet away, with the grid at eye level, read the chart, covering one eye at a time. If the results are concerning, make an appointment with your eye doctor. In the Bathroom 6. Artificial tears. Tear production naturally diminishes as you get older, Christiansen says. The problem is, tears are what keep the conjunctiva, the thin membrane on the surface of the eye, moist. “Once this membrane becomes dry, it loses its protective function and the result is inflammation,” he adds. Your eyes may become watery as your body tries to overcompensate for the dryness. For most patients, over-the-counter artificial tears are all that’s needed, says Christiansen. Eye drops with preservatives tend to be much cheaper, but some people find they cause irritation. Preservative-free eye drops are often packaged in single-use vials. Try both to see which works best for you, he recommends. In the Home Office 7. Eye-comfort lights. If harsh lighting conditions trigger headaches, try using softer-light or LED bulbs, which dim without flickering, strobing, causing glare or making a humming noise. Set up your computer so you’re about 25 inches away from the screen, and position it so you’re looking slightly down at it instead of straight ahead, suggests the AAO. Remember to give yourself occasional breaks from endless Zoom meetings by following the 20/20/20 rule: Turn your head every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. 8. Good computer readers. Talk to your ophthalmologist about getting a pair of computer glasses that are specially designed to help reduce eyestrain. The doctor will calculate the distance you sit from your computer and give you a prescription for single-vision glasses designed for intermediate-distance viewing. “They’re easier to use for prolonged computer use, compared with bifocals or trifocal lenses,” Marioneaux says. There’s no need, however, to invest in special glasses designed to block blue light. According to Marioneaux, the evidence-based medicine does not currently support the use of blue blockers.

Last time you lost them, they showed up in your coat pocket. (Of course.) But sometimes they show up on a random table in your home. Once, they were still in the door. Oof. Losing your keys or having similar brain blips — such as forgetting what you walked into a room for, why you opened your fridge or where you placed your glasses — may happen more often as you age. One in nine adults 45 and older say they experienced more memory problems or confusion over the previous year, according to 2015-2017 data analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Memory short circuits can make you question whether what you’re experiencing is something more serious, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a term that describes worsening confusion and memory loss that in some cases can lead to dementia. Although we can’t tell you definitively if cognitive problems are the culprit — or if you’re in the clear — there are symptoms that experts say can clue you in on what’s normal and what may be cause for concern. Compare your experiences with these all-too-common scenarios for advice on what to do next. Telling a story to a friend, you blank on the name of a shared acquaintance. This is probably normal. There are expected brain changes that happen as you add candles to your cake. “Processing speed can slow down as we age. The speed and ability to retrieve info from your memory may become a bit slower,” says Sarah Kremen, M.D., director of the Neurobehavior Program at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. Most likely, that info will come back to you — long after you needed it. (Of course, her name is Beth!) Focusing on one thing at a time, rather than multitasking or looking at your phone when you shouldn’t be, can help clear background clutter to encode information into your brain, Kremen says. You’ve always been pretty even﻿-keeled, but your sister has noticed your mood swings lately. Consider visiting your doctor. “Any new change in mood over the age of 50 should be considered the brain’s way of sending out warning signals,” says Rhonna Shatz, D.O., adjunct associate professor and an endowed chair in research and education in Alzheimer’s disease at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. “The brain can let you know that it’s not working the way it should be with changes in mood or personality,” she says. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, irritability or lack of initiative and motivation for the first time﻿, or you are going through a relapse of depression or anxiety (that had stabilized), see your doctor. On the other side of the coin, depression and anxiety also cause cognitive symptoms, which is why it’s important to seek professional help to understand exactly what’s going on. You and your spouse are arguing about a conversation that you don’t remember. How often is this happening? And how recently did you two talk about this? It’s normal to forget smaller elements of a conversation you had weeks or months ago, and once someone reminds you of the details, it should come back to you, says James Mastrianni, M.D., professor of neurology and codirector at the Center for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders at UChicago Medicine. Outside factors, such as stress, can stymie your brain’s ability to pluck info from your memory bank, according to research in Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews. What’s concerning is if you don’t remember having the conversation at all, Mastrianni says. Another clue is if you’re having heated arguments with family members about whether certain conversations did or did not happen. Frustrated loved ones may say you told the same story within a 10-minute span. Repetition or forgetfulness of conversations should be evaluated by a doctor. You forgot where you placed your keys. (Though somedays it’s your phone.) Often, this isn’t concerning. “It’s one of the most common things we see as we age, and it mainly occurs because we don’t pay attention to where we place them,” Mastrianni says. Putting items down in the same place, such as a catchall, every day will help. Another tip, he says: When you drop your keys, stare at them for two seconds and notice what’s around them to make sure you record their whereabouts in your memory. There may be a cognitive problem at play if you spend your day tearing apart your house looking for a missing item or you regularly have to replace important items (including car keys) that cannot be found. Worried family members may report that they were accused of moving things or, worse, stealing them. You wanted a knife, but you called it a fork instead. Cognitive issues can appear as language use problems. “There may be a difficulty in getting thoughts together or stringing words into a coherent thought,” Mastrianni says. You may replace words with related — but not correct — words. You asked for the knife, but you meant a fork. Or you’ve lost the meaning of certain words, such as no longer knowing what a zebra is. “These are clearly signs of a dementia process,” he says. You worked as an accountant, but calculating the tip on a restaurant bill has become a challenge. During earlier stages of cognitive impairment, you may feel as if things consistently require more time and effort to complete, says Joel Salinas, M.D., clinical assistant professor of neurology and an expert on neurodegenerative diseases, dementia and Alzheimer’s at NYU Langone Health. “Context, as well as your specific background, matters,” he says. This is most telling if something that had been easy for you becomes difficult. For example, you were a trained accountant but struggle with calculating a tip. Or you feel as if you lost your ability to do a task that was part of your day-to-day living, such as paying bills. Whom to see if you’re worried about your memory If you notice concerning signs, don’t put off a call or a visit to the doctor. “The earlier you can address your concerns, the more likely you can participate in your care and preserve your independence,” Salinas says. Your primary care physician is a good place to start. Several medical conditions can cause memory loss, some of which are reversible, so your doctor will want to rule those out first. If they have concerns after an evaluation, you may be referred to a specialist, such as a neurologist, geropsychologist or a geriatrician for a more thorough workup. Just know: Wait times with these specialists can be long — some estimates say it takes about a month to score an appointment with a neurologist as a new patient.

Medication now available to treat age-related vision loss By Beth Levine, AARP Comments En español Published December 17, 2021 Shutterstock / megaflopp Toni Wright, 54, a beauty industry professional from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was forever squinting at her computer screen and cellphone. In restaurants, especially those with low lights, she was the one holding the menu as far away as her arm could reach. Diagnosed with presbyopia﻿ — age-related blurred near vision﻿ — when she was 50, Wright says, “I needed to have reading glasses with me at all times and almost panicked if I didn’t.” Presbyopia is estimated to affect 2 billion people globally, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). But there is good news for all the squinters among us: In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first (and so far, only) eye drops that treat presbyopia. ﻿The eye drops, called Vuity﻿, contain pilocarpine, which has been used for around 120 years to treat glaucoma. This is the first formulation to target presbyopia specifically. Allergan, a subsidiary of AbbVie, rolled out Vuity on Dec﻿. 9. Available by prescription only, Vuity works very simply﻿. Itslightly reduc﻿es pupil size by constricting certain muscles, explains AbbVie advisory board consultant Marguerite McDonald, M.D., ﻿a clinical professor of ophthalmology at both New York University and Tulane University. The constriction allows for improved up﻿-close vision. Approved for use once daily, it works for up to six hours. It costs about $86 for a 2.5 ﻿milliliter bottle﻿ (about a 30-day supply), depending on the pharmacy you visit. ﻿ Wright, who participated in the clinical trial for Vuity, would put the drops in her eyes in the morning, and she found that the effect kicked in by the time she got to work. McDonald says, on average, it should start working within 15 minutes. “I could see on my computer without struggling or needing glasses, and it lasted throughout the workday,” Wright reports. She says she felt no negative side effects. ​Vuity reports that users may experience temporary problems when changing focus between near and far objects.​ In its development of the drops, the company found that participants achieved a “three-line gain or more reading a near﻿-vision eye chart without losing more than one line in a distance vision eye chart at Day 30, three hours after dosing.” ​ “We know a great deal about the active compound pilocarpine. It was used in higher concentrations and it's very safe,” McDonald﻿ says. She adds that the drops can be used with contact lenses, but as with all eye medications, users should wait 15 minutes after application before inserting lenses. If using other eye drops, wait five minutes between different applications. Steven Plotycia, M.D., an ophthalmologist affiliated with Mount Sinai Medical Center﻿ in New York, warns that the drops may not work for everyone with presbyopia. “The ideal patient for these drops are people in their 40s to 50s who don’t want to wear reading glasses. The age group is old enough to have developed presbyopia but young enough that they would not have started developing cataracts,” he explains. Cataracts are lenses that have started to yellow, restricting the amount of light that gets in, making vision appear darker. Since Vuity acts by constricting the iris, limiting the amount of light that hits the lens, cataract patients will find that the drops make their vision appear even darker. They would have a lot of trouble driving at night or in other situations where light is low. “The significance of this FDA approval is massive. Glasses, contact lenses, and surgery are traditional treatments, but, for various reasons, do not work well for every patient. Having a novel treatment option in the form of a presbyopia eye drop is a welcome addition to our armamentarium against this universal age-related near vision condition that effects essentially everyone over the age of 40,” says Christopher Starr, M.D., clinical spokesperson for the AAO. Nine similar eye drops for presbyopia are in development and may be available in the future. Beth Levine is a health writer whose work has appeared in O: The Oprah Magazine, Woman's Day, Good Housekeeping, ﻿Reader's Digest and many more.","Here is a summary of the article in 3-4 sentences:

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/causes-of-sleeplessness/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series 5 Health Conditions Linked to Poor Sleep Struggling to slumber could be a sign of conditions like congestive heart failure or dementia By Anna Medaris, AARP Comments En español Published August 01, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Getty Images) If you feel like your sleep isn’t what it used to be, you’re probably right. Even healthy aging is associated with changes in sleep patterns like shorter sleep duration, less deep sleep and more frequent awakenings throughout the night. But it’s not all bad. In fact, despite these typical shifts, healthy older adults tend to report fewer sleep problems than younger generations. Put another way, the older you are, the less likely you are to be bothered by an imperfect night’s sleep, says Michael Grandner, a clinical psychologist and director of the Sleep and Heath Research Program at the University of Arizona. That could help explain why, despite a recent AARP survey showing that 70 percent of adults 40 and older reported having sleep difficulties, another study, published last month by Saatva, showed that only 20 percent of boomers said they always or often struggle to get up in the morning. That’s compared to 43 percent of millennials and 48 percent of Gen Zers — even though the older cohort didn’t report that their sleep was any more restful. ﻿ “Part of it might be resilience; part of it might be changing expectations; part of it might be perspective and ability to cope,” Grandner says. But if you’re not coping well with sleep issues in your 50s, 60s and beyond, it could be a sign of a health condition that deserves medical attention — and treatment. “The important thing to remember is if you’re getting older and you feel like your sleep is a problem, if it’s not really interfering with your ability to function, maybe that’s more the normal aging side,” Grandner says. “But if it is actually becoming a real problem, don’t let your doctor just say, ‘Eh, this is just part of aging.’ There might be a solution for this.” Here are five conditions other than insomnia that may be leading to poor sleep — and how better sleep can help fend off disease in the first place. 1. Sleep apnea If you keep waking up unrefreshed even though you seem to be doing everything “right,” there may be a relatively straightforward explanation: sleep apnea. The condition, which causes you to sporadically stop breathing throughout the night, is widely overlooked, with about 85 to 90 percent of people with sleep apnea unaware that they have it, the Cleveland Clinic says. Sleep apnea is especially common in older people, affecting 17 percent of men and 9 percent of women ages 50 to 70. So while it might be tempting to look for an explanation other than a sleep disorder to explain your unsatisfying z’s or daytime fatigue, often a sleep disorder is at least partially to blame. “A lot of times, this kind of thinking — that something else is causing the sleep issue— only delays treatment for the sleep problem, when treating the sleep issue first can often resolve other issues,” says Shelby Harris, a clinical psychologist who is board certified in behavioral sleep medicine and serves as a clinical associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The top-line treatment for sleep apnea is positive airway pressure (PAP), which describes a range of devices that help prevent the throat from closing by increasing air pressure in the airway. Video: 5 Things to Know About Getting Better Sleep Video: 5 Things to Know About Getting Better Sleep 2. Congestive heart failure While heart problems seem distinct from breathing (and therefore sleeping) problems, the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems are intricately linked. That’s why, in broad terms, upwards of two-thirds of people with heart failure (when damage to your heart prevents it from pumping enough blood effectively) also have sleep apnea, says James Rowley, M.D., a pulmonologist and the program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at RUSH University Medical Center. Often these patients have central sleep apnea, when the brain fails to tell the lungs to breathe, rather than obstructive sleep apnea, the more widely known type in which a mechanical issue in the throat blocks air from reaching the lungs. As a result, your sleep is erratic, which puts more stress on the heart, which exacerbates both conditions. “If you don’t treat the sleep apnea, [patients] are not gonna feel better — even if you’ve been treating the congestive heart failure,” says Rowley, the immediate past president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “And then there’s also evidence that treating the sleep apnea helps the congestive heart failure.” Managing heart failure can include lifestyle changes like salt reduction and medications like those that help open up the blood vessels. 3. Menopause Hot flashes and night sweats are stereotypical menopausal symptoms for a reason, with some research showing that as many as 87 percent of midlife women experience them. So it’s no wonder women going through menopause often struggle to get high-quality sleep. It’s not just the symptoms of menopause that can interrupt solid shut-eye during this transition — so, too, can stressors like caring for aging parents or menopause-adjacent mental health conditions like depression. And some research suggests about half of menopausal women have an underlying sleep disorder independent of their life stage. “It can be hard to tease apart, but it is always a discussion to have with your gynecologist, especially one who is very knowledgeable about menopause treatments,” Harris says. Those treatments may include hormone therapy (which can help reduce hot flashes and night sweats) or nonhormonal meds like benzodiazepines (which can help reduce anxiety). The gold standard, though, is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, Harris says. “This approach works on limiting naps during the day, creating a more appropriate sleep-wake schedule, working on any thoughts about sleep that might be interfering with the ability to sleep (‘I must sleep or else XYZ will happen tomorrow’) and improving sleep hygiene, movement and light exposure during the day,” she says. 4. Dementia The term “dementia” encompasses a range of conditions, from mild to severe, Grandner says. “But they all have to do with what’s called neurodegeneration, which means that areas of the brain start losing function and breaking down. And it’s not just the cells themselves dying; it’s also the connections between them that are altered,” he says. Sleep disturbances frequently accompany that process, with about 25 percent of people with mild to moderate dementia and 50 percent of people with severe dementia facing them, according to the Mayo Clinic. More specifically, people with Alzheimer’s — the most common type of dementia — may experience “sundowning,” which often starts around dusk but can last into the night. It can include agitation, anxiety, disorientation and pacing throughout the night, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Dementia’s effect on melatonin production can also disrupt a person’s internal body clock and make it difficult to sleep. “I don’t think there are any neurodegenerative disorders that don’t have a significant impact on sleep-wake regulation,” Grandner says. The reverse is true too: Poor sleep can raise the risk of developing dementia in the first place. One 2023 study looking at 10 years of data from U.S. adults over age 64 found that sleep-initiation insomnia (the type where it’s hard to fall asleep) was associated with a 51 percent increased risk of dementia, and using sleep meds was linked to a 30 percent increased dementia risk. No matter which comes first — poor sleep or dementia — supporting better sleep can include lifestyle adjustments like maintaining a routine and avoiding daytime napping, as well as treatments like melatonin supplementation and light therapy, the Mayo Clinic says. 5. Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease — a progressive brain disorder that is marked by movement challenges like stiff muscles and tremors in the hands and legs — makes it hard to feel comfortable. So people with it often “don’t sleep well because of the rigidity aspects of the disease,” Rowley says. But there’s more to it than that. Recent research showed that even among people with early-stage Parkinson’s who aren’t yet impaired by motor issues, 71 percent had at least one type of sleep disturbance, like insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness, and about half had multiple disturbances. That’s likely related to chemical changes in the brain, Parkinson’s medications and other factors that scientists are still studying, the researchers say. Here, too, it’s key to address both issues. Just treating the Parkinson’s “doesn’t necessarily mean that the insomnia will improve,” Rowley says. “[Patients] should still see the sleep doctor and have cognitive behavioral therapy or sometimes medication.” Prioritizing sleep to help prevent disease If you’re currently disease-free, maximizing your sleep quality can help you stay that way, a new study in the journal Nature Medicine shows. To see how sleep quality and duration affected people’s likelihood of developing all sorts of conditions, researchers looked at data from nearly 7,000 adults who wore activity and sleep trackers over the course of a median of four and a half years. They then squared that data with the participants’ electronic medical records. Unlike most sleep studies, which either analyze one night of an individual’s sleep or review a population’s sleep as it relates to a particular disease, this one looked “across the entire spectrum of human diseases that show up in people’s electronic medical records,” says the study’s corresponding author Evan Brittain, M.D., a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “We were able to take a really unbiased view at what associations with sleep were more important.” The researchers found that the less rapid eye movement (REM) and deep sleep the participants got, the more likely they were to develop atrial fibrillation, or an irregular heart beat. And the more inconsistent their sleep schedule, the greater their odds for obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, depression and generalized anxiety disorder. One of the takeaways, Brittain says, is that going to bed and getting up at the same time every day seems to be more important than getting the oft-recommended eight hours. In fact, seven hours of sleep was the median — not minimum — number of hours people with good health outcomes got. “I think that finding is a hopeful thing for patients because it’s hard for me to say, ‘You need to get more REM sleep, you need to get more deep sleep,’ and patients can’t do anything with that information,” Brittain says. “But saying, ‘It’s really helpful if you go to bed and wake up at the same times each night; that’s really important for your health’ — that’s something that’s easily digestible.” Anna Medaris is a Brooklyn-based freelance journalist with 15 years of experience covering health and lifestyle for publications including The Washington Post, Women’s Health, Business Insider and US News & World Report.","The article explores the relationship between poor sleep and underlying health conditions, particularly in older adults.

https://www.aarp.org/health/brain-health/dementia-rates-doubling/,"Dementia Risk Is Double Earlier Estimates, Even Higher for Black Americans Study shows alarming increase in expected cases, though lifestyle changes can reduce risk By Liz Szabo, AARP Comments Published January 13, 2025 AARP (Getty Images) Americans face a much higher risk of dementia than estimated in previous reports, according to a new study in Nature Medicine. The research projects the lifetime risk of dementia for a 55-year-old to be at least 36 percent for those living to age 95, a rate twice as high as reported in earlier studies. The researchers suggest that their estimates are higher because they took extra measures to avoid underestimating the number of dementia cases. They closely tracked the health of the study’s 15,000 participants over an average of more than two decades. Participants underwent cognitive exams during in-person visits and were also interviewed by phone. The team also examined medical records and spoke to many study participants’ family members or caregivers about any memory problems. The findings may still underestimate the rate of dementia, the study authors say. Although 42 percent of people age 55 and older in their study developed dementia by age 95, researchers could only confirm that diagnosis for 36 percent, says study co-author Marilyn Albert, director of the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and a member of AARP’s Global Council on Brain Health (GCBH). As the population ages, the number of Americans affected by dementia — both as patients and caregivers — will rise. The study projects that the number of U.S. adults who develop dementia each year, estimated at about 514,000 in 2020, will increase to about 1 million in 2060. The risk is most pronounced in Black adults. Dementia risk rose sharply with age in the study. It remained low from age 55 to 75, at 4 percent, rising to 10 percent at 80, says Michael Fang, the study’s first author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits “The findings are very sobering,” Albert says. “This tells us how really serious the problem of dementia is in the United States.” Dementia is an umbrella term for conditions that impair a person’s ability to think, reason and remember to levels that interfere with daily life. It can be caused by several different diseases, the most common is Alzheimer’s disease. Women and Blacks at higher risk Women are more likely to develop dementia because they tend to live longer than men, Albert says. Risk differences between the sexes emerged starting at age 85. People with the APOE-e4 genetic mutation, also have a much higher risk than average. Black people developed dementia more often and at younger ages than white people, the researchers found. In the study, Black participants developed dementia at a median age of 79, compared to 82 among white people. While the lifetime risk of dementia in white study participants was 3 percent by age 75, the risk for Black participants at the same age was 7 percent. By age 85, the lifetime risk of dementia in white participants was 18 percent, compared to 28 percent in Black participants at the same age. While dementia diagnoses will double among white people by 2060, they will triple among Black people in the same period, the study found. Although the new study didn’t explore why Black people developed dementia at earlier ages, Black adults tend to have more risk factors for dementia, including high blood pressure and diabetes, Fang says. In addition, discrimination can cause physical and mental stress, which may increase the risk of dementia, according to the GCBH. Racial and ethnic minorities also tend to have fewer of the educational and economic opportunities that appear to reduce the risk of dementia. Researchers, who launched the study in 1987, deliberately enrolled a large number of Black people, who have been underrepresented in many earlier studies. In the new study, Black people made up 27 percent of participants, who were recruited from Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington County, Maryland. Although the new study presents some of the most comprehensive data yet on dementia risk in Black people, “we can’t really say it’s nationally representative,” notes Hugo Aparicio, M.D., associate professor of neurology at Boston University, who was not involved in the research. Mainly because the study included few Asian, Hispanic or Native American participants. “But it gives us maybe one of the best estimates of risk [for] the African American population that we’ve had.” Cognitive decline is not inevitable “We need to do a much better job at getting out the message that much of this risk is preventable,” says Josef Coresh, M.D., the study’s senior investigator and epidemiologist and the founding director of the Optimal Aging Institute at NYU Langone. A 2024 Lancet Commission Report concluded that 40 percent of global dementia cases are potentially preventable with lifestyle changes. “It is never too early or too late to start protecting our brains,” says Gary Small, M.D., chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center. Adults can reduce their risk of dementia in numerous ways by addressing risk factors such as stress, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and hearing loss, Small says. Research also shows the importance of restful sleep and social engagement. “If we institute prevention efforts in early life and midlife, we may be able to actually reverse some of these trends that we're seeing,” Aparicio says. Video: Six Healthy Habits That Can Help Support Brain Health Researchers funded by the Alzheimer’s Association are expected to publish results in July from a two-year clinical trial that studies whether making several lifestyle changes simultaneously can protect older adults from cognitive decline. On a societal level, Coresh says, lawmakers and regulators should work to improve childhood education and nutrition, which have been linked to a lower risk of cognitive decline in later life. The new study is “a wake-up call to policymakers,” says GCBH member Jason Karlawish, M.D., who is co-director of the Penn Memory Center and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Karlawish, who was not involved in the new study, said he would like to see policy makers better address dementia risk factors, such as obesity; promote healthier diets and exercise; and make hearing aids more accessible. “There are very doable, actionable policy solutions to make people healthy,” he says.

Here’s how to stay safe By Rachel Nania, Updated June 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published July 26, 2022 / Updated June 17, 2024 Getty Images It’s not your imagination: It really is hotter than when you were a kid. In fact, 2023 was the hottest year on record since 1850, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And the nine years from 2014 to 2022 round out the top 10 warmest. Climate experts warn that bouts of extreme heat are going to become more common as global temperatures continue to rise. That’s bad news for the growing population of older adults, who are more likely to get sick from heat — even die from it. In 2023, soaring temps sent nearly 120,000 people in the U.S. to emergency rooms, a 2024 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. Heat-related deaths have been increasing in recent years, with approximately 2,302 occurring in 2023, up from 1,722 in 2022, according to federal data, though other research suggests the number is much higher. A study published in 2020 in the journal Environmental Epidemiology finds an average of 5,608 deaths are attributable to heat each year. A study from a team of Duke University researchers estimates that 12,000 Americans die annually from heat-related causes. Regardless of the total tally, most people who die from the heat are over the age of﻿ 50, the National Institute on Aging says. “It has everything to do with our body’s ability to deal with heat as we age,” Aaron Bernstein, M.D., told AARP in 2022, when he was the interim director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Bernstein is now the director of the National Center for Environmental Health and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry at the CDC. “People who are older, our bodies may not be able to dissipate heat as well as people who are younger. We also tend to have more chronic health problems and may take more medications that affect our body’s ability to deal with heat.” Here’s a closer look at why heat is such a health risk for older adults, and what you can do to stay safe as heat waves become more frequent. Cooling down the body becomes harder People get into trouble when they can’t cool themselves down. That’s when heat exhaustion can occur, often marked by dizziness, fatigue and a weak, rapid pulse. If that goes untreated, heatstroke can set in, bringing with it the potential for long-term organ damage or death. Sweating is the top way that humans cool themselves, Bernstein says. It’s not the sweat itself that is particularly cooling but rather the evaporation process. It takes energy to evaporate sweat off the skin, and the energy source in this equation is heat. So as sweat switches from liquid to vapor, heat leaves your body and you start to cool down. At-risk adults on the rise Temperatures are increasing and so is the aging population. By 2050, roughly 200 million more older adults worldwide are expected to face exposure to dangerous heat, compared with now, research published in Nature Communications suggests. “The effects are projected to be the most severe in Asia and Africa, which may also have the lowest adaptive capacities,” Deborah Carr, professor of sociology at Boston University and a coauthor of the study, said in a statement. Sweat glands become less effective with age. “They can’t pump out as much sweat as quickly,” Daniel Van Durme, M.D., former chief medical officer at the Florida State University College of Medicine, told AARP. ﻿ What’s more, several medications common among older adults can interfere with how efficiently the body sweats or handles heat, Van Durme said, including some antihistamines (to ease allergy symptoms) and drugs used to treat overactive bladder. Certain antidepressants and some blood pressure medicines can also hinder the body’s ability to cool itself — and experts say there are likely many more that inflict this effect. Another disadvantage for older adults is heat’s impact on the heart. Hand in hand with sweating, the body releases heat by increasing blood flow to the skin to push the heat away from the core. This requires the heart to work harder. “And if you have heart disease, that puts strain on an already potentially weak heart,” Bernstein says. “So you see people during heat events having heart attacks, arrhythmias, strokes — there’s a big risk for that.” At-risk adults on the rise Temperatures are increasing and so is the aging population. By 2050, roughly 200 million more older adults worldwide are expected to face exposure to dangerous heat, compared with now, research published in Nature Communications suggests. “The effects are projected to be the most severe in Asia and Africa, which may also have the lowest adaptive capacities,” Deborah Carr, professor of sociology at Boston University and a coauthor of the study, said in a statement. More than 20 million adults in the U.S. have the most common type of heart disease, federal statistics show, and its prevalence increases with age. Nearly half of U.S. adults are affected by diseases of the heart and blood vessels, the American Heart Association reports. A study published in 2023 in the journal Circulation found that the risk of a fatal heart attack among older adults in Jiangsu province, China, was higher during two- and four-day heat waves. The most dangerous days were those of extreme heat and high levels of air pollution, including pollution from wildfires. The researchers estimated that up to 2.8 percent of heart attack deaths may be attributed to the combination. Dehydration amps up the danger Hydration plays a major role when it comes to staying healthy in extreme heat. You need fluid to produce the sweat that cools you down; it’s also essential to keeping the cells functioning and the organs running. Older adults have a harder time staying hydrated, mostly because of a decreased sense of thirst that sets in as you age, says Eric De Jonge, M.D., director of geriatrics at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. Certain medications that draw fluid from the body — including diuretics, used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, and laxatives — can further complicate matters. When you’re dehydrated, the kidneys “can spiral into dysfunction,” kicking off a domino effect of destruction throughout the body, Bernstein says. Dehydration is especially risky for the nearly 40 percent of U.S. adults 65 and older who already have kidney disease. Bernstein urges caution among those who routinely take medications that are hard on the kidneys, including over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen. In addition to kidney disease, another chronic condition that can be worsened by dehydration is diabetes, which the CDC says affects an estimated 29 percent of U.S. adults 65 and older and roughly 19 percent of those ages 45 to 64. Blood sugar becomes more concentrated when there’s less water in the body, the CDC explains, and it becomes “incredibly difficult” to manage blood sugar levels, Bernstein says. Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration Even the brain feels heat’s effects: The part that’s responsible for long-term planning “goes on vacation,” Bernstein says, “and the part of your brain that is in crisis mode is calling the shots.” Judgment can become impaired, and injuries may ensue. To stay safe, make a plan for high-heat days The list of health complications that can arise when temperatures rise seems never-ending — add to it that hot air can aggravate the lungs and trigger breathing issues, even in people who aren’t prone to respiratory distress — but experts say a little planning can go a long way when it comes to staying safe during summer. Here’s what you can do: Check the heat forecast. New this year, the CDC has a dashboard that can show you the heat risk in your community. Just type in your ZIP code, and check the forecast. Pay attention to humidity. There isn’t a single temperature at which things get dangerous, experts say — so much depends on what an individual is used to and how their body acclimates to heat. But one thing that can ramp up the danger is humidity, since sweat, the body’s cooling mechanism, “doesn’t want to evaporate into air that’s got a lot of water in it already,” Bernstein says. Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration As a rule of thumb, “85 [degrees] and humid is when we start to really think a lot and talk to our patients and families a lot about preventive measures,” De Jonge says. Talk to your doctor about your medications. If you take a medication that can affect how your body deals with heat, don’t stop taking it just because high temperatures are on the horizon. “The dangers of stopping may be far worse,” Van Durme warned. Instead, take extra caution in the heat, he says. Your doctor may decide to switch up your medications during the warmer months. Drink past the point of thirst — and get creative with hydration. Don’t use thirst as your guide for hydration because “by the time you feel thirsty, you are already significantly dehydrated,” Van Durme said. The color of your urine is a good indicator of whether you’re well hydrated. Thumbs-up if it’s a pale yellow; bottoms up if it’s dark yellow or orange, De Jonge says. That’s a sign you need to keep drinking — just not alcohol or caffeine. You don’t have to limit yourself to water. Cold fruit — think watermelon and cantaloupe — can boost your hydration levels. Mixing in fruit juice can keep things more interesting for people who get tired of plain water. Have a fan handy. If you don’t have air-conditioning — or even if you do — fans can keep you cool by helping sweat to quickly evaporate from the body. But when the temperature is above a certain level, they’re not very helpful. “When the temperature is hotter outside than in our bodies, fans work like a convection oven; we’re actually blowing heat in,” Bernstein says. A cool shower or bath is another way to cool off at home when things get too warm. Pay attention to your thermostat. If you have a chronic health condition that could put you at higher risk for heat-related illness and the temperature in your home is over 80 degrees, “you need to do something,” Bernstein says. That might mean turning on a fan, relocating to a cooler level in your home or building, or going to an air-conditioned space, even if it’s a neighbor’s house. Know your cooling centers. Many communities set up centers during heat waves to provide a safe space for people to cool down. Identify the closest one, and plan how to get there if you need to use it. If you have pets, check to see whether they’re welcome, says Diane Garcia-Gonzales, a research scientist with the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was part of a team that created community heat maps so state residents can stay informed about heat events in their areas. Don’t forget about other air-conditioned spaces — a church, a library, even a trip to the grocery store or the mall can provide relief. Have a backup plan. It’s always good to have a plan in place in case your air-conditioning goes out or your electricity fizzles and your home starts to heat up, Garcia-Gonzales says. Of course, this depends on whether the issue is widespread. If it’s limited, identify a place where you know you and the members of your household can stay cool. If your air-conditioning goes out during a hot stretch, don’t try to wait out the wave before getting it fixed. Know the warning signs of heat illness — and what to do. Watch out for confusion and slurred speech. Neurological issues mean you need to get to an emergency room. “That’s the one that you don’t want to mess with,” Van Durme said. If someone just needs to sit down — maybe gets a little woozy but is able to carry on a conversation — get them to cool off by moving them into an air-conditioned place or positioning them near a fan. And get them to drink. Another thing: Pay attention to others around you. If you’re at an event or gathering and one person goes down from the heat, “then everybody’s at risk,” Van Durme said. Check in on others. Finally, if you have a neighbor, friend or family member who’s at higher risk for heat-related illness, check in on them when things get warm to make sure they’re keeping up their fluids and staying cool and comfortable. “There’s no substitute for the human, in-person daily visits,” De Jonge says.

That means the red-flag condition can’t send its important message that diabetes may be right around the corner (and that you may already be at risk for some serious health issues). What, exactly, is prediabetes? It's when your blood sugar levels are higher than they should be, but not yet high enough to be considered diabetes. Here are six things you need to know about the condition that affects roughly 96 million U.S. adults, including how to recognize it in time to turn things around. 1. Its cause is the same as diabetes The same factors that raise your risk for type 2 diabetes can set you up for a diagnosis of prediabetes. With the condition, cells in your body aren’t responding normally to insulin, a hormone made by your pancreas that acts like a key to let blood sugar into cells to use as energy. Your pancreas responds by making more insulin, but eventually, as cells continue to not respond, it can’t keep up. At that point, your blood sugar rises, setting the stage for prediabetes — and, by extension, diabetes. 2. Diabetes isn’t inevitable Not all people with prediabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes, but almost all people with the type 2, the most common form of diabetes, start out with prediabetes. For some people with the condition, early treatment, as well as moderate lifestyle changes, can actually return blood sugar levels to a normal range, effectively preventing or delaying diabetes. Prediabetes itself is often reversible (more on that below). How can I find out if I have prediabetes? To see if you’re at risk for prediabetes, take this test (available in English and Spanish) from the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The only way to know for sure is to ask your health care provider to run a blood test. 3. Prediabetes can be a hazard for your heart The “pre” may lead you to believe the condition isn’t serious, but prediabetes puts you at a higher risk for not only diabetes, but also heart disease and stroke. How can I find out if I have prediabetes? To see if you’re at risk for prediabetes, take this test (available in English and Spanish) from the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The only way to know for sure is to ask your health care provider to run a blood test. Experts have known about the link between diabetes and cardiovascular disease for a while now, including that cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among people with diabetes. But more recent research shows that people with prediabetes are also at substantial risk of developing cardiovascular disease. That risk is especially pronounced in the first five years of prediabetes. If you do nothing about prediabetes, your risk of developing cardiovascular disease — which includes high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and other disorders of the heart and blood vessels — is about 50 percent. 4. Symptoms are often absent Some people with prediabetes experience increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue and blurred vision — which are also signs of diabetes. But more often than not, there are no clear symptoms. That’s why it’s important to talk to your doctor about having your blood glucose tested if you have any of the following risk factors: You’re 45 or older.You're overweight. You have a parent, brother or sister with type 2 diabetes. You lead a sedentary life. You've had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) or given birth to a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds. 5. It’s diagnosed with a blood test The only way to know for sure if you have prediabetes is to ask your health care provider to run one of the following three types of blood tests. If you’re diagnosed with prediabetes, you should be checked for type 2 diabetes every one to two years. A1C Test This simple blood test measures your average blood sugar for the past two to three months. The advantages of being diagnosed this way are that you don’t have to fast or drink large amounts of anything. Note: Your doctor may report your A1C results as eAG, or “estimated average glucose,” which directly relates to your A1C. A1CeAGNormal: < 5.7 percent<117 mg/dlPrediabetes: 5.7-6.4 percent117-138 mg/dlDiabetes:≥ 6.5 percent≥139 mg/dl Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test This test checks your fasting blood sugar levels. Since it requires fasting— taking in nothing but water for at least eight hours before the test — it’s usually done first thing in the morning. Normal: <100 mg/dl Prediabetes: 100–125 mg/dl Diabetes: ≥126 mg/dl Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) This two- to three-hour test measures your body’s response to sugar. Your doctor will check your blood sugar levels before you drink a special sweet drink and again two hours later. Normal: <140 mg/dlPrediabetes: 140-199 mg/dlDiabetes: ≥200 mg/dl 6. Prediabetes is reversible In the early stages of prediabetes (and diabetes, for that matter), paying attention to diet and exercise can improve blood sugar numbers, essentially “reversing” the disease and reducing the odds of developing diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, as well as two to three strength training sessions, per week. Not only will that sort of commitment to exercise help keep your weight in check, it will also improve blood glucose levels. And while there is no “prediabetes diet” (or, for that matter, a “diabetes diet”), the ADA recommends a number of eating plans, including Mediterranean, low-carb, vegetarian, and others that emphasize nonstarchy vegetables; whole, minimally processed foods; and little added sugar. A few other things that may help you mitigate your risks: Maintain a healthy weight. If you’re overweight, even a little weight loss can help. A landmark study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that lifestyle changes leading to a weight loss of 7 percent in overweight participants with prediabetes reduced their risk of diabetes by 58 percent. Participants over age 60 reduced their chances of developing diabetes by 71 percent, compared with those who didn’t lose weight. Talk to your doctor about whether it makes sense for you to take the drug metformin. Considered the first-line treatment to help control blood sugar for people with type 2 diabetes, the drug is also recommended by the ADA for people with prediabetes and certain other risk factors. The NIH study found that overweight participants with prediabetes who took metformin lowered their chances of developing diabetes by 31 percent, compared with those who didn’t take the drug or undergo lifestyle changes. The Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved metformin — or any other medication —for prediabetes, so it is prescribed “off-label.” If you have underlying risk factors that put you at greater risk for diabetes — say, for instance, you’re over age 45 or diabetes runs in your family — you’ll need to continue to pay attention to blood sugar levels and lifestyle choices. Otherwise, your prediabetes will return. Find support for prediabetes A support group can help you make the necessary lifestyle changes to avoid progressing to diabetes. Not sure how to find one? The ADA organizes workshops geared to a variety of different groups. To find one near you, contact the ADA (800-DIABETES). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Diabetes Prevention Program can also help you learn about healthy lifestyle changes — related to eating habits, exercise and more — shown to reverse prediabetes.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/what-happens-when-we-dream/,"Healthy Sleep Advice View Series What Goes On in the Brain When We Dream? And is it bad if I don’t remember mine? By Marlene Cimons, AARP Comments En español Published August 14, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Adobe Stock; Getty Images) The 18th-century German novelist and poet Novalis once wrote: “Without dreams, we should certainly grow old sooner.” Sadly, Novalis never lived long enough to find out if he was right; he died at 28 from tuberculosis. But he and his fictional character — who was extolling the value of a dream he’d had that night — may have been onto something. “Dreams are important for staying youthful in spirit, no matter how old we are in years,” says Kelly Bulkeley, a dreams researcher and founder of the Sleep and Dream Database. “Dreaming, even in later parts of life, is still a youthful experience. The energies and capacities are still there, even if dream recall declines,” he adds. “People still dream into their 70s, 80s and 90s. Our mind never says: ‘You’re done with that.’ ” Scientists have many theories about dreams — what they mean and their purpose. But they are still untangling their many mysteries. “Dreams have fascinated humans from the earliest of times,” says Joseph De Koninck, professor emeritus at the University of Ottawa School of Psychology. “Yet modern research is still struggling to understand the nature and functions of dreaming.” De Koninck doesn’t think dreams serve an “essential” function. More likely, they are “a mirror of what you feel,” he says. “If you have a bad dream about someone, for example, it may mean that something bad happened with that person.” Most people forget their dreams upon awakening. Yet the dreams remembered the next morning, those can have staying power, says psychologist Art Funkhouser, at the C.G. Jung Institute in Küsnacht, Switzerland. “In 35 years of leading a dream work seminar and working on normal dreams, I’ve never encountered a dream that the dreamer considered meaningless.” Imagination at play Many dreams are a form of emotional “digestion” — reactions to events and encounters of the previous day, or days, Funkhouser says. “There are other dreams, though, that help us prepare for what we may have to deal with the day after the dream, an examination at the university, for example,” he says. “Dreams also provide a counterbalance, especially for our attitudes, thereby keeping us on track in our development as people and becoming who we really are.” Bulkeley theorizes that dreaming “is the imagination at play, preparing for challenges, rehearsing, practicing things, exercising those capacities that help us thrive as a species,” he says. “It’s mental yoga. It keeps our minds flexible and adaptive.” When do dreams happen? Scientists believe that most dreams occur during REM, or the rapid eye movement stage of sleep. This is when your eyes move rapidly beneath closed lids, heart rate increases and your brain becomes highly active. During REM, muscle tone shuts down — you essentially become paralyzed — which researchers think prevents you from physically acting out what you are dreaming. (Sleepwalking typically occurs during non-REM sleep.) The first REM dream episode, running just 5 minutes or so, usually occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep, De Koninck says. REM sessions happen every 90 minutes and become progressively longer as the night goes on. The second one runs about 15 to 20 minutes; you may have four or five depending on length of your sleep, he says. “In the morning, they last as long as 45 minutes, which is where we get the real long, elaborate dreams.” Several parts of the brain ramp up or relax when we dream, Bulkeley says: The prefrontal cortex quiets down. That’s the part of the brain where we process input from our surroundings and react to it. The secondary visual processing center becomes more active. It’s located in the occipital lobe at the back of the brain and is where we form mental images.The limbic system, in the brain’s center, becomes more active. It is the site for emotions, instincts and memories. “The latest theory of how this all goes together is related to the default mode network” — a system of connected brain areas that become active when people are passive and not focused on the activities around them — “a fancy term for daydreaming,” Bulkeley says. “The default mode network ties it all together,” he explains. “Dreaming is the activity of the default mode network while we sleep.” It’s like daydreaming, “although you have less control over the content, which becomes more emotionally and visually intense.” Put another way: “When we dream, reasoning goes down, emotion goes up, secondary visual processing goes up, and they are all linked together by the default network,” he says.﻿ Scientists learn all this using an electroencephalogram, or EEG, during sleep to measure brain activity. To get a readout on dreams, they wake their subjects up during REM for immediate dream recall before the person forgets, De Koninck says. “When you wake up subjects during REM sleep … their memory is more vivid” he says. Dreaming changes as we age Dreams about people or pets who have died “become more prominent when we get older,” Bulkeley says. “We dream about the dead coming back.” As we age, dreams about being lost or losing things — like one’s keys — tend to increase, he adds, which “seems consistent with age-related changes in cognition and memory, but could be the emotional concern about cognitive changes, not necessarily cognitive changes themselves.” Is there anyone who doesn’t dream? Again, scientists don’t know for sure. “If there are, it’s rare, maybe 1 percent or less,” Bulkeley says, pointing out that dream recall declines with age, which might cause people to think they no longer dream. “The vast majority of humans are dreaming regularly and remembering their dreams periodically.” But there’s no harm in forgetting dreams. “Those who have rare or no dream recall lead normal lives,” Funkhouser says. “Those who remember their dreams, though, would miss them should they cease to remember them. They add color and depth to our lives.” Haven’t you always wondered? Do we dream in color — or in black and white? Research suggests people who were around in the days of black-and-white television tend to dream in gray scale more than those who had no such exposure. Today, most dreams are in color, “although many dreams have no particular color that’s noticeable,” Bulkeley says. “I think of this question as a cultural response to The Wizard of Oz and its cinematic distinction between color and black and white as symbols of consciousness.” Do animals dream? Scientists think they do, although we can’t wake up a sleeping dog or cat and ask. The next best thing: researchers’ studies of the brain activity in sleeping animals. “They have sleep cycles similar to ours, with cognitive activities in waking … that reappear in neural patterns in sleep,” Bulkeley says. Mice, for example, show similar brain waves when they are awake and learning to navigate a maze and when they are asleep, suggesting that “sleep and dreaming perform an information-processing function,” he says, at least in animals with the same basic sleep behaviors as ours. Are my dreams like other people’s? Who among us has not had the I-cut-classes-all-semester-and-now-I’m-facing-the final exam-unprepared (or showing up naked) dream? Other common ones include: Falling or getting lostSex, often of a taboo natureFleeing something that’s chasing youFlying — not in an airplane, but using your bodyDead people visiting, as if alive What’s this about knowing you’re dreaming while dreaming? Some people do. It’s called “lucid dreaming.” The dreamer is aware the events are not real and may be able to control them — like directing their own personal movie — or wake themselves up. Some therapists use lucid dreaming to help people who’ve experienced trauma cope with recurrent nightmares, Bulkeley says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/covid-pandemic-5-year-anniversary/,"94 Percent of COVID Deaths Have Been Among Adults 50-Plus It’s been five years since the start of the pandemic, and older adults continue to bear its burden By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments Published March 14, 2025 Long COVID survivor, Cathy Lydon Mesa. Frankie Alduino Catherine Lydon Mesa remembers feeling like she had been hit by a train on a Saturday evening in September 2022. “I was shaking so much from a fever that I had my hand under my chin to keep my teeth from clattering so loud,” recalls Mesa, now 61. In the days that followed, she struggled to catch her breath, was tortured with headaches, and was so weak that she had to crawl from her bed to the bathroom. “I couldn’t even stand up,” says Mesa, who lives in Queens, New York. Sitting in her bed to eat a bowl of soup would exhaust her. The diagnosis: COVID-19, an illness that she had managed to avoid for more than two years since it first started spreading in the U.S. in early 2020. Given an underlying health condition — Mesa was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, in her 20s — she did what she could to lower her risks of getting infected with the coronavirus. She was vaccinated, boosted and wore a mask in public. Still, the virus eventually found her, and it made her really sick — just like it’s done to millions of older adults. It’s been five years since COVID-19 arrived in the U.S., and in that time, adults age 50 and older have accounted for roughly 94 percent of the 1.2-plus million American deaths. And while hospitalizations are fewer now than they were earlier in the pandemic, the illness is still sending thousands to inpatient wards and wings, and the vast majority are older individuals, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. Why COVID hits older adults so hard Biological changes that develop with age are a big reason why older adults have borne — and continue to bear — the burden of this disease. When you’re older, the immune system cannot fight off foreign invaders as well as it could in your younger years, explains Emily Landon, M.D., executive medical director for infection prevention and control and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine. “And as we get older, your body isn’t as quick or as good at recognizing when something’s wrong.” What’s more, older individuals are more likely to have underlying health conditions, like heart disease or lung disease. And when you pile on an infection, “those medical problems leave you at a disadvantage,” Landon says. An estimated 85 percent of Americans 65 and older have at least one chronic health condition, research suggests, and more than half have two. A 2021 study led by federal researchers found that diabetes and obesity were among the leading risk factors for death from COVID-19. An estimated 1 in 3 U.S. adults 65 and older have diabetes, and more than 40 percent of adults 60 and older have obesity. ‘We had tons of patients’ Anthony W. Okolo, M.D., was a second-year medical resident practicing in the Bronx in early 2020. “I remember when we started hearing a lot about COVID, it came in waves of intensity — that’s the best way I would describe it,” says Okolo, now a hospitalist and geriatrician at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. At first, he recalls chatter about the outbreak abroad; then the virus was in the U.S. “And then the hospital became a full-blown COVID treatment hospital,” he says. Patients were filling the beds, and many of them were older individuals. In Chicago, it was a similar scene. “We had tons of patients,” Landon says. “At one point, almost 50 percent of our hospital was just COVID patients. I mean, it was unbelievable.” By mid-April 2020, about a month after lockdowns started, the hospitalization rate for adults 65 and older was 30.7 per 100,000 people, according to CDC data. For adults under the age of 50, the rate was much lower at 5.1 per 100,000. “We didn’t have any native immunity whatsoever,” Landon says about the coronavirus in 2020. That has changed with the development of vaccines and with ongoing infections. Still, the virus continues to prey on older adults. In early January 2025, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate for adults under 50 was 1.0 per 100,000 people; for individuals 65-plus, it was 18.3. COVID’s lingering effects It’s not just the initial infection that disproportionately impacts the older population. Some research suggests that COVID-19 is more likely to linger in older people, leaving them with new or persistent symptoms — a phenomenon known as long COVID. A CDC study found that 1 in 4 adults age 65-plus have developed at least one long-term health issue as a result of COVID-19. Another large study published in the journal BMJ found almost 1 in 3 adults over the age of 65 sought medical care for new or ongoing COVID symptoms weeks after their initial illness. Mesa, the Queens resident who caught COVID in 2022, is one of them. About a month after she first got sick with COVID-19, she went to see her physician for an unyielding cough and prolonged exhaustion. Her doctor suspected it was long COVID but wanted to give her a little more time to see if the symptoms cleared. Sometimes it takes longer for people with underlying health conditions to return to normal, Mesa was told. Mesa gets a moment of respite in her bedroom. Frankie Alduino She hoped by the four-month mark, she would feel better. “That’s not what happened,” says Mesa, who was diagnosed with long COVID and is now a patient advocate for Solve M.E.'s Long COVID Patient Leadership Advancement Network. More than two years after her run-in with COVID-19, she still struggles with its effects. Everyday tasks like showering and driving can be strenuous. Going out to dinner with friends will wipe her out for the following two days. A simple trip upstairs, “and the coughing fits come on again,” Mesa says. She’s seen some improvement in her long COVID symptoms with medications, therapies and changes to her routine, but she’s still not back to her pre-pandemic self. Nonetheless, she says she feels “beyond fortunate” and tries to focus on what she can do rather than what she can’t. “I also have a tremendous amount of gratitude because I was so sick, I feel that I was spared for a reason,” Mesa says. Mesa gets a moment of respite in her bedroom. Frankie Alduino The Next 5 Years of COVID Living with long COVID Millions of people suffer from long COVID, and many of them are older adults. Some of the most common symptoms older adults experience include: Extreme tiredness or lack of energy (fatigue) Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Coughing Joint pain and weakness High blood pressure Changes in smell or taste Difficulty thinking, concentrating and remembering (brain fog) Source: National Institute on Aging These days, we’re better able to disrupt COVID’s destruction, in large part because of scientific advances made in the past five years. Vaccines developed at record speed help keep mild infections from turning severe. One report from the Commonwealth Fund found that the shots averted 18.5 million additional hospitalizations and 3.2 million additional deaths between December 2020 and November 2022 alone. At-home tests that can alert you to an infection and prescription antiviral treatments to treat it have also helped turn the pandemic tides. “The medicines we have available for COVID right now are really good, but if you don’t know if you have COVID, then you can’t get the medicine,” Landon says, highlighting the importance of the nasal-swab test kits. However, with COVID here to stay, there’s more work to do in our ongoing fight against the virus. Many doctors and researchers say vaccine acceptance is key to our continued success. Roughly 23 percent of the U.S. adult population received the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. The share is higher among older adults, but not by much — an estimated 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had received the most recent COVID-19 vaccine as of November 2024, according to federal data. “I think because we remember so acutely what the pandemic was like, and to not be in a state where we’re hearing sirens going off all hours of the day can have us lower our guard a little bit,” says Amanda K. Johnson, M.D., senior assistant vice president of care models in the Office of Ambulatory Care and Population Health for NYC Health + Hospitals. “But getting vaccinated is important for you, and it’s important for your loved ones.” It’s possible we could see a combination flu-COVID vaccine in the next few years, which public health experts say could help boost vaccination rates. “For some folks, it is one or the other,” Johnson says. Making headway with long COVID treatments is another goal for researchers in the forthcoming years. “There’s not the research base to tell us exactly how to treat and manage that condition just yet, and so I’m hoping that now that we’re out of the emergency response mode, we don’t lose sight of the millions of Americans who are still suffering and living with long COVID,” Johnson says. ﻿ An estimated 6 percent of U.S. adults have long COVID, according to a CDC study, and a significant share of them (about 20 percent) say the illness limits their ability to carry out daily activities. “I just think that anything that anybody can do, no matter how big, how small, is a step in the right direction to helping the overall [long COVID] community﻿,” Mesa says. It may feel like the pandemic is behind us, but the public health community isn’t letting it fade too far in the rearview mirror. Now and in the years to come, they’re taking lessons from our experiences with COVID and preparing for future outbreaks — be it with the coronavirus or an entirely new pathogen. “It’s so hard to imagine that we are five years out from the beginnings of the pandemic, but I’m hoping that people bear in mind that this is the kind of event that has happened before, and it’s possible that it could happen again in our lifetimes,” Johnson says. Okolo adds, “We don’t know what’s coming next. We don’t know if we’ll ever have another pandemic to that scale, but I think what we can learn from COVID in real-time is the importance of having protocols and playbooks in place for if and when such an incident should happen again.” Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID Living with long COVID Millions of people suffer from long COVID, and many of them are older adults.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/foods-that-get-an-unfair-bad-rap/,"Don’t Shun These 8 Foods: Their Bad Reputations Are out of Date Science and guidelines have changed, so your choices can too By Kim Painter, Updated April 02, 2025 AARP Comments Published March 07, 2023 / Updated April 02, 2025 Getty Images Do you fear the fat in avocados? The carbs in popcorn? The cholesterol in egg yolks? If so, you may be missing out on some nutritional winners that, for one reason or another, have iffy, outdated images. Despite encouraging research and, in some cases, updated guidelines from health agencies and medical groups, certain healthy foods and beverages still have bad reputations with too many consumers, nutrition experts say. Here’s what you need to know about some perfectly nice foods that might be on your naughty list: 1. Eggs Eggs are high in cholesterol, with about 200 mg in every yolk. Health groups, including the American Heart Association, long recommended eating no more than three or so a week for that reason. But it turns out that the cholesterol in our diets is only weakly related to the harmful, artery-clogging cholesterol in our bloodstreams. So, recommendations have changed. Since 2015, the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans have set no specific cholesterol limit. The guidelines say eggs can be part of a healthy diet. More recently, in new rules, the Food and Drug Administration said eggs can be labeled a heathy food. The heart association now says that an egg a day is fine for most people and that older adults with normal blood cholesterol and a heart-healthy diet can safely eat up to two. People with high cholesterol should be more cautious about consuming cholesterol, the group says. “The egg is a packed nutritional powerhouse,” says Angel Planells, a registered dietitian in Seattle and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The nutrients in eggs include plenty of protein and vitamin D, he says. Egg yolks also are an especially rich source of the “brain nutrient” choline, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, a Chicago registered dietitian and author of TheSuperfood Swap.﻿ 2. Avocados While it might seem that avocados are now a well-known superfood, Blatner says she still hears from people concerned about their fat content. And avocados do have a lot of fat: 22 grams in a medium one, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But “this is healthy fat … the types of fats that help to lower your heart risk,” says Lena Beal, a registered dietitian in Atlanta and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Beal says she urges clients to “go for the guacamole.” A classic healthy recipe could include just avocados, cilantro, lime, salt and a little (sugar-free) salsa, if you like it a little spicy. Some people include onion and jalapeños. Make it your own but skip the sour cream, spice packets and processed versions full of additives. In addition to healthy unsaturated fats, avocados are surprisingly rich in fiber, Blatner says: “Avocados are so smooth and creamy,” she says, but they can have 14 grams of fiber. Even half an avocado has more fiber than an apple, she says. U.S. dietary guidelines say someone eating 2,000 calories a day should aim for 28 daily grams of fiber. 3. Popcorn People often assume that popcorn belongs in the same category as pretzels and crackers, which are rarely made from whole grains, Blatner says. But popcorn “actually is this fun food that people already enjoy that happens to naturally be a whole grain,” she says. Beal says popcorn “has wonderful fiber in it.” The healthiest popcorn is a batch you pop at home with an air popper or a little vegetable oil, Beal and Blatner say. A tub of heavily buttered stuff from a movie theater is a completely different matter. That movie theater tub can contain up to 1,090 calories and 2,650 milligrams of sodium, according to the heart association. Beal adds that it’s important to read labels when buying bags of grocery store popcorn: Some types are too high in sugar or﻿ salt for people with health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, she says. 4. Coffee A few decades ago, coffee was listed as a “possible carcinogen” by the World Health Organization. That changed when newer studies showed coffee actually reduced certain cancer risks and was probably wrongly maligned because so many coffee drinkers also smoked, according to Harvard’s public health website. Today, there’s a “flow of pro-coffee research,” suggesting the brew lowers risks of diabetes and heart disease, as well as cancer, Blatner says. Coffee might also lower risks of depression and suicide, Harvard says. One big reason coffee might boost health is that it contains high levels of antioxidants, substances that prevent or delay cell damage. Of course, caffeinated coffee also is a stimulant, known for increasing alertness, attention and mood — as long as you don’t overdo it or drink it too late in the day when it can interfere with sleep, Blatner says.﻿﻿ At least one large 2025 study, published in the European Heart Journal,﻿ has found that people who tend to drink coffee all day, instead of mostly in the morning, don’t get the same health benefits, possibly because of effects on sleep. Too much coffee also can raise blood pressure and lead to anxiety and heart palpitations, the heart association says. Coffee is healthiest with “zero or minimal” add-ons such as cream and sugar, Blatner adds.﻿﻿ 5. Frozen veggies Decades of reminders that “fresh is best” have steered too many consumers away from minimally processed frozen fruits and vegetables “picked at the peak of freshness” and full of nutrients, Planells says. “You can have multiple servings of veggies with a microwave in a matter of minutes,” he says. Blatner says that frozen fruits and veggies are ideal backups for days when you run out of fresh produce: “The frozen spinach can be in your omelet. The frozen cauliflower rice can be in your lunch bowl. The broccoli can be your side dish, the frozen berries can go in your smoothies.” 6. Nuts Like avocados, nuts are fatty foods. But most nuts, including walnuts, almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts and pecans, are highest in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are good for your heart, Beal says. They also provide lots of vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber, she says. Macadamias and cashews are higher in saturated fat, she says, so should be more occasional treats. Just watch your portions: An ounce of nuts has 160 to 200 calories, Beal says. The FDA says plain nuts and seeds could be labeled healthy, regardless of saturated fat level, under its new rules. Some products containing nuts – like certain trail mixes or granola bars – might not make the grade because of high levels of sugar, salt, or saturated fat from other ingredients. 7. Full-fat salad dressing If you are still squeezing lemon juice on a bowl of greens and other veggies, you may not have heard the news: The nutrients in raw vegetables are better absorbed when your meal includes some fat. Avocados, nuts and seeds on a salad can help, Blatner says, but so can a dressing made with a healthy olive or avocado oil. “You don’t need to use fat-free salad dressing anymore,” she says. In fact, Beal says, bottled dressings with reduced fat often have extra sugar or salt to add flavor, making them less healthy choices. ﻿﻿ 8. Whole milk Milk and other dairy foods are rich sources of calcium, vitamin D, protein, and other nutrients. Fermented versions, like yogurt, may have even more health benefits. For the lactose intolerant, lactose-free versions offer pretty much the same nutrients. While current dietary guidelines suggest getting your dairy in nonfat or low-fat forms, a growing body of research suggests it’s just fine to mix in some whole milk, along with some full-fat yogurt and cheese. For example, researchers who looked at more than 1,400 people enrolled in 19 studies found no link between eating dairy foods, with any fat level, and problems with weight, cholesterol, or blood pressure. They found a possible link between high-fat dairy foods and better levels of so-called good cholesterol (HDL). Enjoying a creamy full-fat yogurt or cheese cube might even help control your weight by filling you up and curbing your appetite, say the authors of The Whole Body Reset, AARP’s diet plan for people at mid-life and beyond. Still, nutrition experts worry about the saturated fat in whole-fat dairy. So, the Mayo Clinic recommends keeping your total saturated fat intake in mind when you indulge in it. The dietary guidelines say no more than 10 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. The heart association recommends less than 6 percent. ""Full-fat dairy foods like whole milk, yogurt, cheeses, etc., can certainly be part of your mix, as long as you are keeping overall saturated fat in mind,"" Blatner says. So go ahead and have that whole milk latte – but maybe not on the same day you have a steak. What’s off the healthy list? The last time the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled on which foods could be labeled “healthy” was 1994 — and, the agency says, a lot of nutrition advice has changed since then. To match current dietary guidelines, the agency has new rules. ﻿ ﻿ On the healthy list: whole foods such as fresh produce and nuts, along with other nutrient-dense foods low in added sugars, saturated fat and sodium. Off the list: foods low in the recommended food groups like fresh produce or high in added sugar, saturated fat or sodium. Among foods that would no longer make the cut, even if they contain vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein or other qualities that meet older standards: Highly sweetened yogurt. The agency says a “healthy” 6-ounce carton could have no more than 2.5 grams of added sugar. White bread. “Healthy” breads would have to contain certain levels of whole grain. Sugary cereals. Many cereals have levels of added sugar that exceed proposed limits. Many frozen meals. High levels of sodium, added sugar or saturated fat could rule them out. What’s off the healthy list?

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/covid-flu-or-cold-symptoms/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by Is It a Cold? The Flu? COVID? Or RSV? Many symptoms overlap, but a few warning signs set the common illnesses apart By Rachel Nania, Updated January 15, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published September 27, 2022 / Updated January 15, 2025 Getty Images If it feels like everyone around you is battling a sore throat, the sniffles, and that achy, crummy feeling, you’re not wrong. According to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), common respiratory viruses are out in full force this winter. Throughout the country, COVID-19 activity is increasing, flu levels are elevated and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) is “very high,” health officials say. Still, the levels of illness we’re seeing now aren’t unusual for a typical winter season, says Stefan Gravenstein, M.D., a professor of geriatric medicine and director in the Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Care at Brown University. And colder temperatures and recent holiday gatherings are likely fueling the spread. If you catch one of these bugs, or even the common cold, it can be hard to tell what you’ve come down with, since they all share a similar list of symptoms. But knowing what you have can be an important first step to accessing medications that can help keep a mild infection from turning severe. Here are a few tips from experts on how to distinguish among the different diseases and how to recover from each of them. Plus, they have some advice on what you can do to help avoid getting sick in the first place. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. COVID-19 has a few distinct symptoms The truth of the matter is that several symptoms for a cold, the flu, RSV and COVID-19 overlap. Chief among them are sore throat, runny nose, cough and headache. There are some more specific symptoms, though, that could signal your sickness is caused by COVID-19. Loss of taste or smell, for example, is a common warning sign of a coronavirus infection. “Especially if you don’t really have a runny or stuffy nose and you have this symptom, that probably is something that’s more specific for COVID,” says Albert Shaw, M.D., an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. “And it’s one we would see less so in someone with a common cold or someone with influenza.” Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Another symptom that’s more typical with COVID-19 than with the others is diarrhea, Shaw says. It may not be as prevalent as some of the other COVID symptoms, but people still get it with a coronavirus infection. Diarrhea is not a common sign of the flu in adults (it is in kids, though), nor does it usually accompany a cold or RSV. “That said, there are other viral and bacterial illnesses that can give you diarrhea, so that alone doesn’t mean it can only be COVID. But if you’re trying to differentiate, I would say that those elements, if they’re present, might be of help,” Shaw says. Disorientation could point to COVID-19, especially in older adults, says Kenneth Koncilja, M.D., a geriatrician at the Cleveland Clinic. “I’ve seen more of my older patients present with symptoms of confusion [and test positive for COVID-19], where you might think it’s a urinary tract infection,” he says. And wheezing is more often a symptom associated with RSV, Gravenstein says, though people with flu and COVID can wheeze too, he notes. Sneezing a lot? That’s typically a symptom that’s more common with a cold or RSV than with the flu or COVID. And chances are, if you have a cold, you won’t experience the body aches and fever that accompany an influenza or coronavirus infection. (RSV can cause a low-grade fever, though.) Video: How to Prepare Your Immune System for the Winter Keep a COVID test — or two — on hand It’s still important to keep an at-home COVID test (or two) on hand — especially during fall and winter. That way, if you start to feel sick, you can check to see if your symptoms are due to COVID-19 in a matter of minutes. Don’t have any tests? The federal government reopened its program, and each U.S. household can order four free tests. There are also at-home tests available at pharmacies and some major retailers that can check for flu and COVID at the same time, with one swab of the nose. If you’re positive for COVID-19, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral pill, like Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) or Lagevrio (molnupiravir), which can significantly lessen your chances of severe illness. For flu, there are also antiviral medications that can treat an infection. In both instances, it’s important to start these treatments early in the disease course, so talk to your doctor right away if you find out you have COVID-19 or flu, or suspect you do and want to get tested by your provider. Video: How to Prepare Your Immune System for the Winter Prescription medications usually aren’t prescribed for RSV, although some bad cases may require hospitalization. That could change soon, however, since “there are a variety of treatments for RSV that are in clinical trials,” Gravenstein says. For now, RSV care often calls for fluids, rest and symptom management with over-the-counter medications, according to the CDC. The same goes for a cold. It’s not too late to get your vaccines One way to lower your likelihood of getting the flu, COVID-19 and RSV in the first place is to get vaccinated against each disease. And the good news is: If you skipped these shots in the fall, it’s not too late to get them. “In general, we say that any time during the respiratory season is a good time to get a vaccine if you haven't gotten it,” Gravenstein says. Not everyone who gets vaccinated will be able to completely avoid an infection, but the separate shots can blunt the severity of symptoms and help to keep you out of the hospital.“The vaccines are a lot like seat belts,” Gravenstein explains. “Wearing a seat belt doesn't keep you from getting in a car accident; you just don't get hurt as badly.” When it comes to COVID-19, health experts recommend that everyone 6 months and older get the recently updated coronavirus vaccine; adults 65 and older should plan on getting a second shot in the spring. Even with new coronavirus variants in the mix, health experts say the vaccines still help protect you from severe illness if you catch COVID. For the flu, adults 65 and older should ask for a high-dose vaccine, CDC recommendations say. There are three options to choose from, but experts say the differences among them are minimal. For most people, the best one to get is the one your doctor or pharmacist has available. There’s no need to space out your flu and COVID-19 shots, so if it’s more convenient to get them at the same visit, the CDC says that can be done. There’s also an RSV vaccine available, and it’s recommended for all adults 75 and older and for those ages 60 to 74 with certain risk factors, such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. While there is no vaccine to help prevent a cold, there are several steps you can do to avoid one: Wash your hands often, stay away from people who are sick, and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. These measures can also help you avoid many other illnesses swirling about this cold-weather season.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/vitamin-b-benefits/,"The ABCs of Vitamin B What you need to know about the eight different types of this essential nutrient carlosgaw / getty images By Constance Sommer, AARP En español Published July 21, 2022 Thought much about B vitamins lately? If not, maybe you should. There are eight varieties of B vitamins. And between them, they support brain health, heart health, DNA development and energy regulation. Plus, they’ve been found to prevent migraines, ward off recurrence of some skin cancers, and even possibly slow the progression of a devastating neurodegenerative disease. Some people believe “the B stands for ‘boring,’ ” says Mark Moyad, M.D., director of preventive and alternative medicine education at the University of Michigan Medical Center in the department of urology. The reality, he says, is when you look a little closer, the B vitamins “are one of the most fascinating categories in medicine.” But like other vitamins, they should not be taken on a whim. There’s evidence, for example, that too much folic acid (vitamin B9) in supplement form can encourage the growth of cancer cells in older people, and an excess of biotin (vitamin B7) can mess with blood lab results. “There’s some risks to taking supplements,” says Debbie Fetter, an assistant professor of nutrition at UC Davis. “They’re not entirely benign,” given that they can have side effects and even interfere with other drugs. Experts recommend checking with your physician before you start any supplement, both to make sure it isn’t interacting with something you’re already taking, and to ensure that you’re not consuming excessive amounts of a nutrient you’re getting plenty of in your diet. This particularly applies to B vitamins. Here’s what you need to know about them: B1 (thiamine) What it does: Thiamine helps to turn the food you eat into the energy your body needs, the National Institute of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements explains. It’s especially essential for cell formation and function, and for brain and heart health, adds Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a Massachusetts-based nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Foods you can find it in: You’ll find thiamine in yeast, pork, brown rice, beans and lentils, and fortified breakfast cereals. That said, heating these foods can reduce the thiamine content, according to the Mayo Clinic. How much you should be getting: The National Institute on Aging says men 51 and older need 1.2 milligrams (mg) per day; women 51 and older need 1.1 mg daily. Who might need a supplement: Most people in the U.S. consume the recommended amounts of thiamine, according to the NIH. However, it’s worth noting that up to 20 to 30 percent of older adults may have some degree of thiamine deficiency, so talk to your doctor if you’re concerned. Health care providers may recommend individuals who consume too much alcohol, people with HIV, diabetics and people who had bariatric surgery supplement with thiamine, Anderson-Haynes says. B2 (riboflavin) What it does: It helps break down carbohydrates, proteins and fats, says the Mayo Clinic. And like vitamin B1, it plays a major role in cell growth and function. Surprising benefits: A high dose can reduce migraine frequency by up to 50 percent, studies show, though researchers aren’t sure why. Foods you can find it in: You’ll find riboflavin in eggs, organ meats, lean meats, low-fat milk, mushrooms, spinach, fortified cereals, breads and grain products, according to the NIH. How much you should be getting daily: Men 51 and older should aim for 1.3 mg, and women 51 and older should get 1.1 mg, the NIA says. If you’re a migraine sufferer, your doctor may recommend a much higher dose (about 400 mg daily) as a preventive measure. Who might need a supplement: Vegans, athletes who are vegetarians, and people who don’t consume dairy may have trouble meeting the recommended daily amount, the NIH says, and may benefit from a supplement. The same goes for people with a genetic disorder called riboflavin transporter deficiency. B3 (niacin) What it does: This one is also important in cell development, again helping to turn the food you eat into the energy you need, Anderson-Haynes says. Surprising benefits: When taken in the form of nicotinamide (one of two main forms of niacin in dietary supplements; the other is nicotinic acid), it can reduce the risk of recurrent nonmelanoma cancers, a study in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests. Foods you can find it in: Red meat, poultry, fish, nuts, legumes, seeds, brown rice, fortified cereals and grains, and bananas. How much you should be getting daily: Men 51 and older should get 16 mg a day and women 51 and older need 14 mg, the NIA says. Who might need a supplement: Those who have limited diets due to poverty or illness, those who consume too much alcohol, and individuals who may have carcinoid syndrome might benefit, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most people get what they need in their diet. B5 (pantothenic acid) What it does: This B vitamin helps to break down fats and give the body energy. Potential benefits: Researchers are looking into whether a B5 derivative, pantethine, may help lower cholesterol, slow the progression of Alzheimer’s, or even prevent or treat COVID and long COVID. Foods you can find it in: Animal meat, seafood, eggs and milk, mushrooms (especially shiitakes), avocados, potatoes, broccoli, whole grains (brown rice, wheat, oats), peanuts, sunflower seeds and chickpeas How much you should be getting daily: 5 mg for adults, the NIH says. Who might need a supplement: Deficiency is rare; most Americans get enough B5 in their diet, the NIH says. B6 (pyridoxine) What it does: Vitamin B6 is a key player in more than 100 enzyme reactions involved in metabolism. It’s also important to immune function, the NIH says. Surprising benefit: Increasing vitamin B6 intake may lower depression and anxiety in women, a large study published in the International Journal for Vitamin and Nutrition Research found. Foods you can find it in: Tuna, salmon, beef liver, and potatoes and other starchy vegetables. You can also find B6 in fortified cereals, chicken, turkey, chickpeas, cottage cheese, squash, rice, bananas and spinach. How much you should be getting daily: 1.7 mg for men and 1.5 mg for women, the NIH says. Who might need a supplement: Those whose kidneys don’t work properly, who have autoimmune diseases, and those who consume too much alcohol, according to the NIH. B7 (biotin) What it does: It helps turn the carbohydrates, proteins and fats that we eat into energy the body needs. Popular theory: Plenty of people say that taking biotin makes your hair, skin and nails stronger, but there isn’t a lot of evidence for that, experts say. Plus, the Food and Drug Administration says, taking biotin in supplement form can “significantly interfere with certain lab tests and cause incorrect results that may go undetected” — especially tests that diagnose heart attacks. “Biotin interference is a major deal,” the University of Michigan’s Moyad says. He recommends patients stop taking biotin a couple of days before doing any blood test. Foods you can find it in: Meat, fish, eggs, organ meats, seeds, nuts, sweet potatoes, broccoli and spinach, according to the NIH. How much you should be getting: 30 micrograms (mcg) per day, the NIH says. Who may need a supplement: Individuals who are dependent on alcohol and people with a rare genetic disorder called biotinidase deficiency. B9 (folate /folic acid) What it does: Folate helps in the production of genetic material (DNA and RNA). And research suggests it supports brain health and aids in mental and emotional health. Surprising benefits: Some studies have found a link between low folate levels and depression. Watch out: Older adults who take folic acid supplements may be at increased risk of cancer, particularly prostate cancer, researchers are discovering. Popping folic acid supplements “is not as benign as people thought,” says Natalia Krupenko, a nutritional scientist at the University of North Carolina, who studies the interaction between folate and cancer. “Try to get it from your food,” she adds. Most supplements tend to contain more than the recommended daily dose of folic acid, according to the NIH. Foods you can find it in: Beef liver, asparagus, ﻿brussel﻿s sprouts, dark, leafy greens like spinach or mustard greens, oranges and orange juice, nuts, beans and peas. In addition, folic acid is added to all kinds of grain foods, from breakfast cereals to corn tortillas, enriched rice and pasta, and bread. How much you should be getting daily: 400 mcg Who might need a supplement: Non-Hispanic Black women, people with disorders that lower nutrient absorption (like celiac or inflammatory bowel disease), people with a specific mutation in the MTHFR gene, and those who consume too much alcohol, the NIH says. ﻿ ﻿B12 (cobalamin) What it does: B12 “is basically your energy vitamin,” Anderson-Haynes says. It helps to prevent a blood condition that makes people tired and weak, according to the NIH, and helps to keep the body’s blood and nerve cells healthy. Surprising benefits: Ultra-high doses of the vitamin may slow the progression of ALS, a degenerative neurological disease, researchers recently discovered. Watch out: Some drugs can lead to B12 deficiency, particularly ones taken for acid reflux (H2 receptor blockers like cimetidine, famotidine and ranitidine, and proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole, esomeprazole and lansoprazole). The common diabetes medication metformin may also affect vitamin B12 absorption. Foods you can find it in: Meat (especially beef liver), poultry, clams, fish, eggs, dairy products and some fortified products like nutritional yeast, breakfast cereals and other grains How much you should be getting daily: 2.4 mcg Who might need a supplement: Somewhere between 3 and 43 percent of older adults have a vitamin B12 deficiency, according to the NIH. Your doctor can do a blood test to find out if your B12 levels are running low. Other risk factors for B12 deficiency include those with gastric disorders or who’ve had stomach surgery, who might not absorb enough B12; individuals with a condition called pernicious anemia; and vegetarians﻿, vegans and infants of vegan women. “There’s a lot of different factors that can mess with your B12,” Moyad says. Symptoms of a B12 deficiency can include feelings of weakness and fatigue, says the NIH. Should I take a B complex? Probably not, unless you’ve been instructed by your physician, who can test you for any vitamin B deficiencies, including those more common in older adults. ﻿ “If you eat a good diet, you don’t need a B complex,” says Lisa Young, a nutritionist and professor at New York University. “Most of these nutrients are found in lots of foods, so a deficiency is going to be somewhat unlikely.” And when it comes to vitamins in supplement form, more isn’t always better.","The article explores the importance of Vitamin B, a group of eight essential nutrients that support various bodily functions, including energy production, brain health, and heart health. The key findings highlight the benefits and risks associated with each type of Vitamin B, as well as the recommended daily intake and potential deficiencies. A surprising insight is that taking certain Vitamin B supplements, such as folic acid and biotin, can have adverse effects, including increased cancer risk and interference with lab test results, emphasizing the need for consultation with a physician before taking any supplements.",292
https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/5-ways-to-snack-smarter/,"How to Snack Smarter Healthier choices to grab between meals LightFieldStudios/iStock/Getty Images Plus/Getty Images By: Rachel Meltzer Warren En español Published December 04, 2019 A healthy breakfast, lunch and dinner are important. But what you munch between meals makes just as much of an impact on the quality of your overall diet as any of those three squares. That's because nearly a quarter of the calories American adults take in each day come from snacks, according to federal nutrition data. “Snacks need to not just satisfy hunger but also add nutritional value,” says Lauri Wright, chair of the Department of Nutrition & Dietetics at the University of North Florida. As we get older this idea becomes more crucial. The reason? “Mother Nature is just not nice,” says Joan Salge Blake, nutrition professor at Boston University and host of the health and wellness podcast Spot On! Metabolism decreases around 2 percent — which amounts to about 150 fewer calories needed daily — each decade after age 20, Wright points out. As calorie needs go down, nutrient needs mostly stay the same or even increase. Thus, your meals and snacks have to pack a nutritional punch. Here's the good news about snacks: If you choose the right foods, they can bridge nutrient gaps in your diet, help you stay satisfied so you don't overeat at meals, and give you energy when you need it — all while tasting great. Read on for a few strategies to make every bite count. Control the calories There's no precise number of calories you should get in a snack; the specifics depend on your individual needs. But in general, you'll want to look for foods that provide more nutrients and fill you up for fewer calories. “A well-planned snack can make all the difference in not gaining weight over time,” Wright says. Instead of chips or high-calorie snack bars, try air-popped popcorn with two rounded tablespoons of grated parmesan, or half a cup of cottage cheese with cantaloupe. Both options give you around 10 percent of your daily calcium needs. Also, keep an eye on portion sizes, even for edibles that you think of as being good for you. If you're not sure where to start, try a snack that's around 100 to 150 calories; if that's not enough, eat more next time. Pack it with protein This satisfying nutrient is key when it comes to snacks that will tide you over until your next meal. According to a study from the University of Missouri, when adult subjects ate a high-protein yogurt for a midafternoon snack, they felt less hungry, waited longer before starting their next meal and, ultimately, ate around 100 fewer calories at dinner than those who'd snacked on crackers or chocolate. As we age we may need even more protein, to prevent the loss of muscle mass. Snacks that include beans, dairy or nuts — in items like hummus, yogurt and peanut butter — are all good sources of protein. Fill up on fiber Protein is one-half of the satiation equation. The other half is fiber. In addition to helping us feel satisfied, fiber plays several other essential roles. “Fiber aids digestive health and can assist us with blood sugar control and lowering cholesterol,” Wright explains. Unfortunately, only around 5 percent of the population gets the amount recommended by health experts (for women over 50, that's 21 grams a day; for men, 30 grams). To help reach your daily goal, snack on fiber-rich veggies, such as carrots; fruits like pears or berries; legumes, including chickpeas; whole grains, such as popcorn; and nuts, like almonds. Limit sugars Take refined-grain snacks, like pretzels and crackers, as well as sweetened snacks, including cookies and candies, off your regular munchies menu; save them for once-in-a-while treats. For starters, they're not great at filling you up or providing valuable nutrients. What's more, foods high in simple sugars can cause inflammation in the body. “Inflammation is linked to many chronic illnesses, including arthritis, heart disease and even Alzheimer's,” Wright says. Shake off the sodium The American Heart Association recommends that adults age 50 and older limit sodium intake to no more than 1,500 milligrams daily — that's less than a 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Nearly three-quarters of the sodium we eat comes from processed, prepackaged and restaurant foods. Making snacks yourself, however, means you can use lower-sodium ingredients to right at least one-half of the equation. Fresh produce, unsalted nuts and nut butters are naturally low in sodium. When you shop for packaged foods like whole-grain crackers or yogurt, compare labels to find the lowest-sodium varieties.

The article explores the importance of healthy snacking, highlighting that nearly a quarter of daily calories come from snacks and that nutrient-dense choices can bridge dietary gaps. Key recommendations include choosing snacks that are high in protein and fiber, low in added sugars, and mindful of calorie and sodium content. Notably, the article emphasizes that as we age, our snacking needs change, requiring more nutrient-dense options to compensate for decreasing metabolism and increasing nutrient needs. By making informed snacking choices, individuals can support overall health and well-being.",293

You can keep it in tip-top shape this flu season — which is turning out to be one of the worst in years — if you focus on a plant-based diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods, ﻿Heller says. ﻿ Here are eight foods that nutritionists recommend for flu season. 1. Green tea Whether these particular tea leaves can really fend off the flu has been a source of debate among health researchers for years. But a meta-analysis published in July of 2021 in the journal Molecules looked at more than eight studies involving more than 5,000 participants to conclude there really is ample evidence to believe the beverage — and specifically, the catechins that provide its antioxidant power — can help your immune system fend off influenza. 2. Sweet potatoes﻿ They’re a great source of beta-carotene, a phytonutrient that helps your body make vitamin A. “It supports respiratory health by increasing the number of immune cells in the body,” explains Anna Taylor, lead outpatient clinical dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. This is especially important for older adults, she adds, as our bodies make fewer immune cells as we age. ﻿ Instead of cooking sweet potatoes with butter or brown sugar, Taylor recommends roasting them with olive oil, oregano and black pepper. “You’ll get additional benefits from the spices, but you’re not loading up on sugar and saturated fat﻿, both of which suppress your immune system,” she says. 3. Berries They’re a rich source of vitamin C, which stimulates production of infection﻿-fighting white blood cells, Taylor says. A 2018 review of studies found that berries increased levels of disease﻿-fighting cells in older adults, such as natural killer cells and T-cells. They also contain flavonoids, substances that have antioxidant properties and protect all your cells﻿ —﻿ including your immune system cells﻿ —﻿ from damage, Taylor adds. ﻿ It’s easy to incorporate berries into your diet: ﻿“﻿Add them to your morning yogurt or oatmeal, or even cook them and throw them on your French toast instead of maple syrup,” Taylor recommends. 4. Beans Why ﻿Fluids ﻿Matter if You ﻿Get the ﻿Flu Whether water, electrolyte-rich beverages, broths or green tea (see above), you really do need liquids if you’re sick with the flu. Not only is it important to fend off dehydration, staying hydrated helps you maintain enough circulating blood volume to treat infection. (Just go easy on the caffeinated sodas and coffee.) And yes, doctors say chicken soup can’t hurt, since fever can cause you to lose water as well as salt. Chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans﻿ — ﻿they’re all rich in vitamin B12, a nutrient many older adults are low in, Heller says. “People over the age of 50 don’t absorb vitamin B12 as well in their body, but your immune system needs it to fight disease and repair damaged cells to keep you healthy,” Heller explains. ﻿ Beans are also high in zinc, which helps boost your body’s production of white blood cells, Taylor says. “Zinc deficiency has been linked to immune system dysfunction,” she says. Taylor recommends at least a half a cup of cooked beans three times a week﻿. ﻿You can throw them into soups, salads or even rice dishes﻿. ﻿For a healthy crunchy snack, roast chickpeas in some olive oil. 5. Nuts and seeds These foods are rich in vitamin E, which plays a key role in your immune system by supporting the growth of germ-fighting T-cells, says Lauri Wright, ﻿director of nutrition programs at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. They’re also a good source of omega-6 fatty acids. Walnuts are an especially good choice, as research shows they have a very positive effect on your gut microbiome, says clinical nutritionist Kate Cohen. They also have more alpha-linolenic acid﻿ — an essential fatty acid important for immune function﻿ — than any other type of nut. 6. Salmon Why ﻿Fluids ﻿Matter if You ﻿Get the ﻿Flu Whether water, electrolyte-rich beverages, broths or green tea (see above), you really do need liquids if you’re sick with the flu. Not only is it important to fend off dehydration, staying hydrated helps you maintain enough circulating blood volume to treat infection. (Just go easy on the caffeinated sodas and coffee.) And yes, doctors say chicken soup can’t hurt, since fever can cause you to lose water as well as salt. It’s ﻿not plant﻿-based, but it is one of the few foods that provides vitamin D, which plays a huge role in regulating your immune system, says Jennifer McDaniel, owner of McDaniel Nutrition Therapy in Clayton, Missouri. A 2020 study published in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people who had untreated vitamin D deficiency were almost twice as likely to test positive for COVID-19 ﻿as patients who had sufficient levels of the vitamin. A 6-ounce salmon filet has about 600 international units (IU﻿) of vitamin D, which is close to the 800 IU that﻿ is recommended daily for people 70 and older. Another bonus: ﻿It’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have also been shown to strengthen your immune system. If you’re not a fan of fish, McDaniel suggests marinating it in brown sugar and Dijon mustard for 45 minutes, then throwing it on the grill. “It mellows out that fishy taste, and it gives it a smoky flavor,” she explains. Canned salmon counts, too: ﻿Throw it over a salad for a quick meal, she says. ﻿ 7. Garlic It’s rich in a compound called alliin, which may be the source of its immune﻿-boosting properties, notes Libby Mills, a Philadelphia-based nutritionist. A 2020 review published in the journal Medical Hypotheses found that garlic itself seems to stimulate cells related to immune system function. Another study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that people given about 2½ grams of aged garlic extract for 90 days not only had higher levels of immune system cells, but they also had fewer symptoms of cold and flu, and missed fewer workdays due to these respiratory illnesses, than a control group. At the very least, if you eat enough of it, you’ll probably keep people away from you, Mills jokes. Although there’s probably not enough research to support taking a garlic supplement, Mills recommends that you cook with it in the colder winter months. You can make your own pasta sauce with tomatoes and garlic, since vitamin C (found in tomatoes) is itself an antioxidant that helps the immune system she says. 8. Kefir Research, including a 2021 study published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, suggests that certain compounds found in fermented dairy such as kefir (which is like a thin yogurt) have anti-inflammatory properties that can help the immune system fight viral infections. The probiotics found in kefir and other fermented foods also help to calm chronic inflammation, according to Harvard Health. “Fermented dairy is rich in probiotics, which seem to have a positive effect on the immune system,” Mills explains.

New research shows that incorporating these three red, round fruits into your daily diet can reduce your risk of heart disease by as much as 40 percent. Indeed, diet can have a tremendous impact on heart health — and should be the first line of defense when treating high cholesterol or high blood pressure, two of the biggest risk factors for heart disease. ""A heart healthy diet is always the first step,"" says Michael Blaha, M.D., director of clinical research for the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease. ""In some patients we can see a dramatic improvement in cholesterol from diet alone."" Fortunately, these antioxidant-rich fruits are as tasty as they are healthy. Tomatoes Lycopene is the power antioxidant in tomatoes. Levi Brown A new study by Tufts University scientists in Boston showed that eating lycopene-rich foods such as tomatoes more than five times a week over an 11-year period reduced coronary disease risk by 26 percent. Lycopene is an antioxidant compound that gives tomatoes and certain other fruits and vegetables their color. It's best to eat tomatoes cooked, though. ""The heating process allows lycopene to be better absorbed,"" says Gerard E. Mullin, M.D., of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Join a discussion in the healthy eating community A red apple a day may keep the heart doctor away. Levi Brown Apples An apple a day can reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol by as much as 40 percent, according to a new, small Ohio State University study. Also, the Iowa Women's Health Study, which tracked more than 34,000 postmenopausal women for 18 years, found a link between apple eating and a lowered risk of dying from heart disease. Be sure to munch on the fruit rather than drink juice; the peels house the most antioxidants. Replace soda with antioxidant-rich cranberry juice for heart health. Levi Brown Cranberries Drinking 3 cups of cranberry juice daily can raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels by 10 percent and reduce heart disease by 40 percent, a study at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania showed.
