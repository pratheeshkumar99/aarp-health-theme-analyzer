Plus, the importance of testing and treating during this historically bad flu season By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published February 24, 2025 AARP (Getty Images 3) If it seems like everyone around you is getting sick this winter, you’re not wrong. The U.S. is having one of the worst flu seasons in years, with most states reporting high or very high levels of flu activity. Tens of thousands of patients are filing into hospitals each week, the latest federal data shows, and so far, 16,000 people in the U.S. have died from the flu this season. At the same time, other bugs, such as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), COVID-19 and norovirus, are also swirling about and sickening the masses. Steven Furr, M.D., a family physician in Jackson, Alabama, and board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, says a few factors are feeding the worrying influenza trends this year. “One, this is just a tough flu strain that’s going around right now,” Furr says. “Typically, there are two flu strains we deal with, influenza A and influenza B. Influenza B tends to be a milder strain, whereas influenza A tends to be much more severe. And essentially, every case we’re seeing this year is influenza A.” Another contributor: Flu vaccination rates are low this year compared to previous years. As of Feb. 8, less than half of the U.S. adult population (45 percent) has received a flu shot this season, and roughly the same share of children (45.9 percent) have been vaccinated for influenza, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. “So that really hurts when the number of people who are immunized is much less,” Furr says. Making matters worse, Furr says, is that doctors are seeing more cases of pneumonia following the flu. (Influenza can cause damage to the lining of the lungs, Furr explains, leaving you more susceptible to other infections that can morph into pneumonia.) In some instances, the subsequent pneumonias are resistant to antibiotics, making them especially difficult to treat. Preventing the flu: It’s not too late If you skipped your flu shot this fall, doctors say it’s not too late to get one now. “Usually, you’ll get some protection within a week to 10 days, and we’re not through the flu season yet,” Furr says. While flu activity tends to peak in February, cases can continue through March and April. “In fact, we’ve seen some years where it actually goes to the summer months,” Furr says. Another reason to get the vaccine if you haven’t already: While influenza A is pummeling the country now, sometimes influenza B “starts showing up later in the season,” Furr says. And it’s possible — albeit unlucky — to get infected with both strains during the same flu season. “So really, if you haven’t been vaccinated, you ought to do so,” Furr adds. Adults 50 and older are also eligible for a pneumococcal vaccine, which can help prevent a common type of pneumonia. This vaccine can be administered at any time during the calendar year. Feeling sick? It’s important to test and treat If you start experiencing symptoms of the flu — fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue and more — it’s important to get tested to confirm that what ails you is, indeed, influenza. Symptoms of other respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19 and RSV, can sometimes mimic the flu. Furr says a sure sign of flu is the rapid onset of symptoms. “Most people who get the flu will tell you, ‘I was fine at 11:51 a.m., but I felt really bad at 11:52 a.m.’ I mean, you can just almost point to the time that you suddenly get those severe body aches, then you start getting the fever,” he says. You can get a flu test at your doctor’s office or use a combination COVID-19/flu test, sold over the counter at most drugstores. If you’re positive for flu A or B, your doctor can prescribe antiviral medication that can help keep your symptoms from becoming severe — and the medicine works best when started immediately. (There are also antiviral treatments for COVID-19 if it turns out your infection is caused by the coronavirus.) “Antivirals interfere with the virus and decrease the level of the virus in a person’s body, and thereby decrease complications, decrease symptoms, get you better faster, and in some cases, [they] even prevent death,” Amesh Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, explained in a recent media briefing with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID). Antiviral treatment is especially important for older adults, who are more likely to get seriously ill from an influenza infection, says William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Between 50 and 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur in adults 65 and older, CDC data shows, and 70 to 85 percent of flu-related deaths happen in this age group. “As we get older and physically age, our immune systems also aren’t quite as robust as they were when we were younger, and so our immune systems are less able to fight off these infections,” Schaffner said during the NFID briefing. “As a consequence, older people are more likely to be hospitalized, admitted to the intensive care unit, and, frankly, die of these infections. We would like to do as much as we can to prevent that progression of illness.” Taking an antiviral early on in the course of an influenza infection may also reduce your risk of developing a secondary infection, like pneumonia. That’s because antivirals help keep your immune system in fighting shape so it’s better able to mount a defense against other infections that are trying to take hold, Adalja explains. “When you have influenza, it’s kind of a battle between the virus and your immune system. And a lot of the defense systems go into overdrive fighting influenza, and that puts you at risk for developing bacterial pneumonia because you are paralyzed fighting influenza,” Adalja says. “Year in and year out, the data would indicate that taking an antiviral as early as possible does reduce the severity of illness and keep you out of the hospital and the intensive care unit,” Schaffner says. “And often when it comes to influenza, the secondary bacterial infections that cause the more severe cases of pneumonia, that’s what puts you into the intensive care unit.” A few other tips to help stay healthy this flu season: Avoid people who are sick, cover your coughs and sneezes, and wash your hands and frequently touched surfaces often, the CDC says.

Why do we cry, types of tears and more fascinating facts about the salty water in your eyes By Hallie Levine, AARP Comments En español Published August 23, 2022 Getty Images/AARP Whether it’s a sad movie, news of a recent death or chopping onions, certain events can move you to tears. There are many different purposes to your tears, which is why your eyes produce anywhere from 15 to 30 gallons a year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Although other animals shed tears, scientists have long said humans are the only animals capable of shedding emotional tears. But a small new study from Japan found dogs’ eyes welled up with tears of joy when being reunited with their owners. (See box at the end of the article for details.) Why do we cry? Just as there are many different reasons why your eyes well and sometimes spill over with tears, there are different types of tears, each made of different substances. We cry to protect our eyes, to wash out irritants and because, well, we are moved to tears. “There are three types of tears: basal tears, emotional tears and reflex tears,” explains David Silverstone, M.D., a professor of ophthalmology at the Yale School of Medicine. The three forms of tears have some things in common. They all share certain key ingredients and are all made up of three layers, known as the tear film: An inner mucus layer to keep the tear stuck to the eyeA watery middle layer to keep the eye wet, fight off bacteria and the cornea, or the clear outer layer of your eyeAn oily outer layer to prevent the tears from drying out How are tears made? The water in your tears is produced by the lacrimal glands above your eyes, Silverstone says. This fluid is made up of salt and water, which helps keep the surface of your eyes lubricated and healthy. The mucus and oil come from your meibomian glands, oil glands along the edge of your eyelids, where your eyelashes are. “In order for your tears to work properly, you need both components,” he adds. As you blink, these substances come together and spread across the surface of your cornea. They then drain into your tear ducts, the small holes in the inner corners of your eyelids, and down through your nose, where they either evaporate or are reabsorbed. How are the three types of tears different? There are also some key differences among the three types of tears. Here’s a closer look. 1. Basal tears These are the tears that your eyes are bathed in all day. When you blink, you spread them evenly over your eye’s surface, to improve your vision and focus. They wash away dirt and germs, to keep your eyes healthy and free of infection. 2. Reflex tears Famous Quotes on Tears “If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.” —Mark Antony, Julius Caesar “But mermaids have no tears and therefore she suffers so much more.” —Hans Christian Andersen, The Little Mermaid “Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears.” —Charles Dickens, Great Expectations “I often cry when I am happy, and smile when I am sad.” —Anne Brontë, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall “For every laugh, there should be a tear.” —Walt Disney in The New York Times These are the tears that your eyes produce when you chop an onion. They wash away harmful irritants like smoke or particles. They come mainly from your lacrimal gland, so they are mostly water. Your eyes make more of them than basal tears, and they contain substances, such as antibodies, to help fight germs. 3. Emotional tears These are the tears that pour out of you when you go through a crying jag. They contain additional proteins and hormones you won’t find in other tears, such as prolactin, potassium, manganese and stress hormones. One theory as to why we cry tears of emotion is that you release stress through these tears, to help calm your body down. Unlike basal tears, your body doesn’t make them automatically. For emotional tears to kick in, your limbic system — the part of your brain that regulates emotions — sends a signal to your brain’s message system to activate your lacrimal glands to produce tears. The result? A full-on cry-fest. When you make a lot of them, they overwhelm your tear ducts. As a result, they spill out of your eyes down your cheeks and even sometimes drip down into your nose. Why do we cry emotional tears? It’s thought that emotional tears themselves have an evolutionary purpose: They’re a way to get empathy. Research has found that people who get social support when they shed tears report that they feel better than those who hold back their waterworks, or who don't have any support. What is dry eye? As you get older, your lacrimal gland’s production of water starts to slow down, says Silverstone. This can make you more susceptible to develop a condition known as dry eye, which may make eyes feel painful and impact vision. You’re also more susceptible to blepharitis, a condition that causes eyelid irritation and swelling. “Your meibomian glands can become inflamed over time, so that its secretions get stuck,” explains Silverstone. “I tell my patients that they need to take care of these glands by applying a warm compress to their eyes for 15-20 seconds a day. It’s like their eyes’ version of flossing.” Adding in artificial tears and possibly an omega 3 fatty acid supplement may also help to treat dry eye, he adds. Your eye doctor can help you find solutions.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/extreme-heat-stroke-heart-attack-risk/,"Extreme Heat View Series Heat Waves Can Be Hard on the Heart Soaring temperatures increase risks for heart attack and stroke By Rachel Nania, Updated June 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published July 24, 2023 / Updated June 17, 2024 Getty Images It’s not just heat stroke you have to worry about on extremely warm days. Experts say high heat can increase your risk for an actual stroke, as well as a heart attack and other cardiovascular issues. In fact, research suggests the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease (conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels) may double or triple when heat reaches extreme temperatures. A big reason: The heart has to work harder when it’s hot out, says Arash Harzand, M.D., a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Emory University. It has to pump more blood as the body works to cool itself down. (When you’re hot, the blood in your body gets routed away from the internal organs to just under the skin, where it releases heat — much like a radiator.) The body also demands more oxygen when it gets overheated, and it’s the heart’s job to deliver it. Dehydration from heat can put additional stress on the heart, since water helps the heart pump blood through the blood vessels. When you’re dehydrated, “the tank is just emptier. And so with a less full tank, your heart has to work even harder to meet all that metabolic demand,” Harzand says. Deaths from extreme heat have been increasing in the U.S. There were more than 2,300 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2023, according to federal data, up from 1,722 in 2022. Patricia Best, M.D., an interventional cardiologist and associate professor of internal medicine and cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic, estimates that at least a quarter of these deaths can be attributed to cardiovascular disease. Hot temperatures + pollution = a dangerous combination A study published in July 2023 in the journal Circulation found that the risk of a fatal heart attack among older adults in Jiangsu province, China, was 18 percent higher during two-day heat waves with heat indexes at or above the 90th percentile (ranging from 82.6°F to 97.9°F). Risks were 74 percent higher during four-day heat waves with heat indexes at or above the 97.5th percentile (ranging from 94.8°F to 109.4°F). The most dangerous days, however, were those of extreme heat and high levels of air pollution — a heart-health risk in and of itself. The researchers estimated that up to 2.8 percent of heart attack deaths may be attributed to the combination of extreme temperatures and high levels of fine particulate pollution, which comes from sources like factories, cars, trucks and wildfires. “And unfortunately, it’s becoming much more common these days when you have the confluence of wildfires and high temperatures,” says Sanjay Rajagopalan, M.D., a professor at Case Western University School of Medicine and chief of cardiovascular medicine at University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute. When it comes to stroke, studies suggest that extreme temperatures — both hot and cold — can increase risk. What’s more, research presented at the American Stroke Association’s 2020 International Stroke Conference found that spikes in temperatures may influence the severity of strokes. The researchers found that for every 9°F increase in average temperature range over three days, the severity of strokes increased by 67 percent. Risks for these heat-related cardiovascular events are not the same for everybody. Precautions are especially important for people with an underlying heart condition, high blood pressure or obesity. Individuals without access to air conditioning and shelter during high-heat days are also at greater risk, Rajagopalan says. ﻿ Heat-related cardiovascular deaths are expected to rise Cardiovascular deaths from extreme heat are projected to increase by 162 percent in the U.S. by the middle of the century, new research suggests, even if currently proposed policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are implemented. If emission-reducing efforts are ignored or are minimal, heat-related cardiovascular deaths could shoot up by 233 percent over the next several decades, a 2023 study published in Circulation found. Black adults and people 65 and older are most likely to be affected by the impact of heat on the heart, the researchers note. “The projections of this study focus on cardiovascular disease deaths, and, therefore, they represent conservative estimations of the adverse effects on cardiovascular health due to extreme heat,” American Heart Association volunteer Robert Brook, M.D., a professor of medicine and executive director of cardiovascular prevention at Wayne State University School of Medicine, said in a news release. “Nonfatal heart attacks, strokes and heart failure hospitalizations outnumber fatal events and are also highly likely to be linked with extreme heat days. The full extent of the public health threat, even just due to cardiovascular death, is likely much greater than presented in this study.” Staying safe in the heat The takeaway, Rajagopalan says, is to be aware of the risk so you can work to minimize it. “﻿Many people don’t recognize that this could be life threatening,” he says.﻿ Find a cool place to stick out the hot days — whether it’s at home or at a nearby cooling shelter. (Find them listed by state at the National Center for Health Housing.) “Being in an environment where temperatures are regulated is of the utmost importance,” Rajagopalan says. What’s more, running your air conditioning during unhealthy air quality days can help to filter out pollutants and reduce the number of harmful particles in the air you breathe. A few other tips: Time it. If you have to go out in the heat, try to go out in the early or late parts of the day when the sun isn’t as strong. And don’t be afraid to take regular breaks. Find some shade and rest for a bit. In some areas of the country, the temperatures are high even in the evening. On those days, minimize all of your time outside, Best says. Heat-related cardiovascular deaths are expected to rise Cardiovascular deaths from extreme heat are projected to increase by 162 percent in the U.S. by the middle of the century, new research suggests, even if currently proposed policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are implemented. If emission-reducing efforts are ignored or are minimal, heat-related cardiovascular deaths could shoot up by 233 percent over the next several decades, a 2023 study published in Circulation found.

The full extent of the public health threat, even just due to cardiovascular death, is likely much greater than presented in this study.” Stay hydrated. Some people with cardiovascular conditions are used to being told to watch their fluid intake and not overdo it, Harzand says. “But hydration is important,” he adds. People with high blood pressure and heart failure who are fluid-sensitive should talk to their doctors about the best ways to stay hydrated on hot days. Dress for the heat. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing, Harzand says. And don’t forget sunglasses, a hat and sunscreen. Don’t stop taking your medications. “Don’t try and make changes to your medications because you think it’s better or safer to not take a certain medicine when you go outside,” Harzand says. If you have any concerns about your medication regimen and the heat, talk to your doctor. Be on the lookout for warning signs of heat illness. Older adults are among those at higher risk for heat-related illness. Signs of heat exhaustion include heavy sweating, cold and clammy skin and weakness, among others. Heat stroke symptoms include red, hot and dry skin (no sweating); a fast and strong pulse; confusion, dizziness and nausea; and a throbbing headache. ﻿ Editor's note: This story, originally published July 24, 2023, has been updated.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/measles-outbreaks-01-2024/,"Do I Need a Measles Shot at My Age? What older adults should know about immunity to the virus as cases climb By Rachel Nania, Updated April 01, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published January 24, 2024 / Updated April 01, 2025 Getty Images The U.S. has seen more measles cases this year than it did in all of 2024, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. As of April 3, 607 cases of the highly contagious disease have been reported in 2025 across 22 U.S. jurisdictions. The vast majority of these cases were in unvaccinated individuals or in people of unknown vaccine status. In 2024, the United States had 285 total cases. Two children have died in Texas from measles complications. One death in an adult in New Mexico is still under investigation, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. That unvaccinated adult tested positive for measles, but the cause of death has not been confirmed. If these numbers don't seem particularly alarming, know that “even one case of measles is something that we should all sit up and pay attention to,” says Patricia A. Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and immediate past-president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “And the reason for that is, it is the most contagious and easily transmittable virus that we have.” Here’s what you need to know about measles as new cases surface, including the best way to protect yourself. 1. Measles is highly contagious Like many other viruses, measles spreads through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. ﻿ But unlike other common viruses, measles is so contagious that up to 90 percent of people who are close to an infected person will become infected if they are not immune to the virus, according to the CDC. “It doesn’t have to be cough right in your face,” Stinchfield says. Tiny virus particles can survive in the air for two hours, where they “circulate around and bounce over to this person and that person, and before you know it, you’ve exposed a lot of people,” she says. What’s more, a person infected with measles can spread the virus four days before the most obvious symptom — a telltale rash — appears, and for four days after. 2. Many older adults have immunity With the current outbreak, you might be wondering: Do I need the measles vaccine? If you’ve had measles — and you probably have if you were born before 1957, the CDC says — it’s unlikely you’ll get it again. You’re also considered immune if you’ve had the two-dose MMR vaccine, given for measles, mumps and rubella. According to the CDC, two doses of MMR is about 97 percent effective at preventing measles — and that protection lasts a lifetime. However, people vaccinated before 1968 and those vaccinated between 1968 and 1989 may need an additional dose of MMR, says Robert H. Hopkins, Jr., M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. That’s because some adults may have been given a less effective vaccine that was administered in the '60s before MMR was available, or some may have received only one dose of MMR initially. (One dose of MMR vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles, the CDC says.) If you can’t remember whether you’ve had the illness or two shots of MMR vaccine, talk to your doctor. The CDC says there is no harm in getting another dose of the vaccine, even if you have prior immunity. (Hopkins notes that immunocompromised or pregnant people should not receive the measles vaccine.) Keep in mind that no vaccine is 100 percent effective, and about 3 out of 100 people who are fully vaccinated for measles will get it if exposed to the virus, the CDC says. Fully vaccinated people who get measles typically experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people. ""The best defense against measles is vaccination,"" Hopkins says. 3. Without population immunity, measles can spread Because the virus spreads so easily, you need a high level of immunity in the community — or about 95 percent of the population immunized — to prevent ongoing transmission, says John Schieffelin, M.D., an infectious disease physician and associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. Research shows that the U.S. is under that threshold. During the 2023–2024 school year, MMR vaccination coverage among kindergartners was 92.7 percent, down from 95 percent in pre-pandemic years, according to CDC data. This translates to roughly 280,000 kindergartners who are at risk for measles. In some states, measles vaccine coverage among children is under 85 percent. Vaccine misinformation is partially to blame for this dip, Stinchfield says. So is the pandemic, since many non-urgent doctor’s appointments were skipped or delayed, and so routine vaccinations were missed. (The first dose of the MMR vaccine is typically given around the first birthday; the second dose is around kindergarten entry.) If vaccination rates continue to decline, measles could reestablish itself in the U.S., health experts warn. “Any kind of drop in our vaccine rates, we need to pay attention to and get them back up where they belong,” says Stinchfield, who adds that grandparents can help play a role by talking to their children and grandchildren about vaccines. 4. Measles can be dangerous, even deadly Schieffelin says a common misconception is that measles isn’t a big deal, since virtually everyone used to get infected. But that is not the case. Common symptoms — which include fever, cough, runny nose — can cause a person to feel “miserable,” says Stinchfield, who helped take care of hospitalized children during a large measles outbreak in Minnesota in the 1990s. Three to five days into the illness, a rash breaks out and spreads from the top of the head down the body. At this point, a fever can spike to more than 104°F, the CDC says. The thing with measles, though, is that it’s not uncommon for the illness to turn severe. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the U.S. who get measles end up in the hospital, according to the CDC. Complications range from dehydration to pneumonia to encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. Measles can also mess with your immunity to other illnesses, Stinchfield says — a phenomenon called immune amnesia. Young children are at increased risk for these complications; so are older adults, Schieffelin says. “As we get older, we don’t tolerate [viruses] quite as well,” he says. It’s estimated 136,200 people worldwide, mostly children, died from measles in 2022, according to a report from the CDC and the World Health Organization. 5. Unvaccinated travelers can spread measles Most people in the U.S. are protected against measles with the vaccine, but the virus hasn’t been eliminated worldwide. In fact, the global vaccination rate for both MMR doses hovers around 74 percent, according to the CDC. In some countries, it’s as low as 66 percent. An unvaccinated traveler who picks up a case in another country can bring it to the U.S. and spread it to other unvaccinated people, Stinchfield says. In a community with low vaccination rates, the disease will spread like wildfire, she adds. Measles “is still out there,” Schieffelin says. “And by not being vaccinated, you really do run the risk of getting sick as well as your family members getting sick.” ﻿ Editor’s note: This story, first published Jan. 24, 2024, has been updated to include new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/foods-to-avoid-after-50/,"6 Foods to Skip After 50 They may look tempting, but they are packed with unhealthy levels of sugars, fats and salt. Try these alternatives instead Danielle Del Plato By Alison Gwinn, Updated January 12, 2024 AARP En español Published August 06, 2021 / Updated January 12, 2024 We’re not going to lie. Eating healthily after 50 requires effort on two fronts: boosting your intake of good-for-you foods, such as berries, leafy greens, whole grains and lean proteins, while cutting out the foods that clog your arteries and oh-so-easily expand your waistline.​ ​When it comes to the latter, focus less on making certain foods verboten (who doesn’t suddenly want chocolate when told never to eat it?) and more on how your health is more important than the sugar spike or instant gratification they offer. When possible, just say no — or at least “Whoa!” — to the following.​ ​1. Fried foods that triple the calories ​If it helps, pause to imagine the vat of oil that basket of fries or onion rings has been submerged in, and consider how its saturated fat “may have a negative impact on blood cholesterol,” says Amy Gorin, CEO of Plant Based With Amy in Stamford, Connecticut. ​ ﻿​The American Heart Association recommends a diet in which only 5 to 6 percent of calories come from saturated fat, meaning that if your daily calorie intake is 2,000 calories, no more than 120 of those calories should come from saturated fat. Bottom line: Get the side salad instead of restaurant fries. When you look at labels, consider that “a 200-calorie serving of food should have no more than 2 grams of saturated fat,” says Nancy Farrell Allen, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.﻿ Do this instead: “Break out the air fryer!” advises Christine Rosenbloom, a registered dietitian and nutritionist, coauthor of Food & Fitness After 50 and author of the blog A to Z ... Simple, Practical, Science-Based Tips for a Long Healthy Life. She swears by her fryer: “Air-fried fish (cod, tilapia, even salmon) is great in the air fryer, as are ‘fried’ veggies, like new potatoes, green beans, broccoli and brussels sprouts. Spritz with olive oil and add some herbs.” Kate Zeratsky, registered dietitian and nutritionist at the Mayo Clinic, recommends playing around with other cooking methods. Look at roasting vegetables in the oven with a tablespoon of oil, ﻿“playing with the temperature to get the texture — soft or crispy — that’s appealing to you.”﻿​ ​2. Sugary drinks, including most bottled teas ​Soft drinks aren’t your only enemy. Bottled teas, fancy coffee drinks and “fresh” lemonades can all be loaded with the sweet stuff. “For example, the 16-ounce chai latte at Starbucks, one of its most popular drinks, has 42 grams of sugar,” Rosenbloom says.﻿​ ​Beware of misleading labels on bottled drinks. “Just because a drink says ‘pure’ or ‘green tea’ or ‘honey’ doesn’t mean it has less sugar,” Rosenbloom says. What about products touting their organic cane sugar, coconut sugar or raw sugar? “Sugar is sugar,” she says.﻿﻿ A 2022 study led by the University of South Carolina of more than 90,000 women found that those who drank at least one sugary beverage a day had a 78 percent higher risk of developing liver cancer than those who consumed less than three servings per month.﻿﻿ ﻿​Bottom line: “Aim to keep added sugar intake to 10 percent or less of total daily calories,” Gorin says. “For a 2,000-calorie daily diet, that would be no more than 200 calories, or 50 grams, of added sugar per day.”﻿ Do this instead: Sip a cup of prune juice — yes, prune juice. “I love to recommend Amaz!n Prune Juice 7.5-ounce cans, which are perfectly portioned,” Gorin says. Each serving offers 4 grams of fiber — a good amount — which aids your digestive health and helps you feel good. And it contains no added sugar.” Or infuse water with fresh fruit in flavors such as orange, blueberry lemon, and kiwi watermelon, suggests Jordan Hill, lead dietitian with Top Nutrition Coaching (topnutritioncoaching.com). “It will add both flavor and some micronutrients from the fruit.” Allen’s recommendation: Try herbal teas or reduced-sodium bouillon or bone broths if you crave a savory beverage. Zeratsky suggests either flavored carbonated water or one of the new prebiotic or probiotic, low-sugar sodas. 3. Packaged foods with sneaky sugars​ “Hidden sugars can be found in pasta sauces, yogurt, granola bars, instant oatmeal packets and breakfast cereals,” Allen says. Why’s that so harmful for older adults? “Excess sugar can put stress on organs such as the pancreas and liver,” Allen says, “which can increase blood sugar and blood triglyceride levels and raise the risk of fatty liver disease.”​​“Sugars increase one’s risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, the incidence and prevalence of which increase as we age﻿,” says Thomas Loepfe, a geriatrician at the Mayo Clinic. At a time in life when every calorie should be nutrient-dense, “added sugar really contributes to calories we don’t need﻿﻿.” ​ Added sugars are inflammatory to the body and can lead to unfavorable health problems, Hill says. ﻿“The American Heart Association recommends women limit added sugar to 25 grams a day and men to 36 grams a day.” Studies back up the harmful effects of sugar. A 2023 study out of the University of Missouri found a link between Western diets high in fat and sugar and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can lead to chronic liver disease. Another 2023 study, this one out of the University of Pittsburgh, found that excess sugar can exacerbate the symptoms of inflammatory disease.﻿ Bottom line: Check labels for added sugars — but don’t fret over natural sugars in fruits or milk. Do this instead: “If you’re looking for something sweet, I recommend upping your fruit intake. Fruit is naturally sweet, offers a great source of fiber and will keep you more satiated than the sugary packaged items,” Hill says. Allen suggests making your own quick bread mini-muffins — blueberry, zucchini, banana, pumpkin or cranberry orange — using whole-wheat flour. Gorin advises using frozen fruit to make a healthy smoothie. “One of my favorite things in the freezer section: frozen wild blueberries. Not only do they offer two times the health-helping antioxidants of conventional berries, they’re proven to benefit your memory and brain health. Blend them with unsweetened almond milk, peanut butter, Greek yogurt and banana for a delicious, fueling smoothie.” 4. ﻿Foods loaded with stealth salt﻿ ""Seventy-five percent of people over age 60 have high blood pressure. And even if you're on medication, you want to lower your sodium intake,” Rosenbloom says. If you think you're eating a low-salt diet because you don't salt your grilled corn or soup, think about that frozen pizza or canned soup you just heated up. Those items are loaded with stealth salt, too. And the largest randomized clinical trial ever to look at the effects of reducing salt intake, published this year in The Lancet, found that lowering sodium led to improved symptoms like swelling, fatigue and coughing—and an overall better quality of life. ""Seventy-five percent of the salt in our diet comes from processed foods, not the salt shaker,” Rosenbloom says. So what can you do? An easy way to spot low-sodium foods, she notes, is to look for those in which sodium is 5 percent or less of the daily value; anything in the 20 percent range is high-sodium. Bottom line: Aim for 1,500 to 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day. Do this instead: Get back into the kitchen and cook, Allen advises, keeping the recipes simple, using whole ingredients and using seasonings that have no added sodium. “For example, have the fixin’s for a make-your-own-pizza using whole-wheat naan bread, pizza sauce, reduced-fat cheese, an assortment of veggies and lean meats,” she says. Rosenbloom recommends checking out the frozen “healthy” product lines that keep sodium down. “I’ve tried some of the newer product lines from Lean Cuisine,” she says, “and they are flavorful without as much sodium.”﻿​​﻿ 5. Ultra-processed snacks​ Unless you’re picking an apple from a tree or getting your milk straight out of a cow, most of the food you eat is processed. It’s the ultra-processed foods that make the list to strike from your diet. “Minimally processed foods like bagged greens, diced vegetables and nuts offer convenience,” Allen says. “And canned tomatoes and frozen fruit and vegetables are an excellent way to enjoy produce processed at peak quality and freshness.”​​But many ready-to-eat, processed foods, including cake mixes, snack chips, ketchup, sweetened yogurt and “meat lovers” frozen pizzas, add food coloring, sodium, preservatives and other hard-to-pronounce additives to make consumers happy. And that’s not good for you.​​Many processed foods are void of fiber and nutrients such as potassium or magnesium, and they tend to be calorically dense, with a lot of fat and salt, says Joseph Gonzales, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic.​​“And some of the preservatives, like nitrates, may be harmful in high amounts, perhaps leading to premature aging of cells in the body,” Loepfe says.﻿﻿​ Bottom line: Make label-reading a habit.﻿ ﻿ Do this instead: “You can’t go wrong with whole nuts, like pistachios in the shell or shelled almonds or peanuts,” Rosenbloom says. “And healthy cereal is a good snack for older adults because 93 percent of those over age 60 eat cereal with milk and fruit, so it’s a good way to boost nutrients.” Just watch for added sugars in cereals, even the “healthy” ones. Or reach for a hard-boiled egg. “When it comes to wholesome snacks, they are a naturally nutrient-rich choice,” Gorin says. “And the American Heart Association says healthy older adults can have up to two eggs per day as part of a heart-healthy diet.” Zeratsky suggests “the most wonderfully packaged to-go food: an apple, banana or orange.” Finally, Allen recommends making a charcuterie board with sliced lean turkey or chicken, whole wheat crackers, reduced-fat cheese, pumpkin seeds, almonds, dried apricots and cherries. 6. Alcohol﻿ The days of triple-margarita Mexican dinners should be behind you. Why? “Alcohol metabolism changes when we age, and we become more susceptible to its negative aspects,” Loepfe says. “Alcohol can impact fall risk, interact with the medications we take as we age and lead to an increased risk of dehydration. Alcohol contributes to many health problems, including liver disease, heart disease, kidney disease, our immune system function and neurological diseases like dementia.” A recent University of Pennsylvania study of 36,000 adults found that even moderate levels of alcohol consumption — a few beers or a glass of wine per week — are linked to harm to the brain, no matter what your age. And if you think alcohol helps you get more or better sleep, think again. “While it may make it easier for us to fall asleep, it doesn’t usually help us stay asleep,” Allen says. “Frequently, it wakes us up in the middle of the night to visit the bathroom.”﻿ Bottom line: Government guidelines recommend no more than two drinks a day for males and no more than one drink a day for females.﻿﻿ Do this instead: “There are so many low- or no-calorie alcohol options, and bartenders are creative with mocktails!” Rosenbloom says. “If you do consume alcohol, think about diluting it with sparkling water, club soda or low-calorie cranberry juice.” Hill’s suggestion: Try low- to no-sugar kombucha. “Kombucha has live bacteria to help support gut health, and it’s a healthier carbonated beverage than your typical soda.” For Zeratsky, one of the best alternatives is a flavored carbonated water or spritzer with a splash of fruit juice or muddled fruits such as raspberries, limes or oranges.﻿ Editor’s note: This story was updated Jan. 12, 202﻿4, with additional information.​﻿ Alison Gwinn is a contributing writer and health reporter and a longtime editor at such publications as The New York Times, O: The Oprah Magazine, Women’s Health, InStyle and Entertainment Weekly."
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/difference-between-dementia-alzheimers/,"Prepare to Care View Series Dementia vs. Alzheimer’s: Which Is It? How to understand the difference — and why it matters By Kathleen Fifield, Updated May 09, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published June 15, 2020 / Updated May 09, 2023 Getty Images The terms “dementia” and “Alzheimer’s” have been around for more than a century, which means people have likely been mixing them up for that long, too. But knowing the difference is important. In the simplest terms, one is broader than the other. If the two were nesting dolls, Alzheimer’s would fit inside dementia, but not the other way around. While Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia (accounting for an estimated 60 to 80 percent of cases), there are several other types. The second most common form is vascular dementia, which is caused by decreased blood flow to the brain. Other types of dementia include Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia. In addition, certain medical conditions can cause serious memory problems that resemble dementia. A correct diagnosis means the right medicines, remedies and support. It could also impact clinical trial eligibility and participation. What it is Dementia In the simplest terms, dementia is a decline in mental function — thinking, remembering and reasoning — that is usually irreversible. It’s a syndrome, not a disease, notes neurologist Ron Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging in Rochester, Minnesota. The catchall phrase encompasses several disorders that cause chronic memory loss, personality changes or impaired reasoning, Alzheimer’s disease being just one of them, says Dan G. Blazer, M.D., a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at Duke University School of Medicine. To be called dementia, the disorder must be severe enough to interfere with your daily life, says psychiatrist Constantine George Lyketsos, M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer’s Treatment Center in Baltimore. What it’s not? Typical mild forgetfulness that sometimes accompanies aging — say, having trouble remembering the name of an acquaintance who comes up to you on the street. In fact, the earliest stage of dementia, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is considered “forgetfulness beyond what is expected from aging,” Petersen says. With MCI, a person is still functioning normally — paying her bills, driving well enough, doing his taxes — though performing some of those tasks may take longer than they used to. When someone starts to need regular assistance to do such daily activities, “that gets into the dementia range,” Petersen says. Alzheimer’s Alzheimer’s is a specific brain disease that progressively and irreversibly destroys memory and thinking skills. Age is the biggest risk factor for the disease. Eventually, Alzheimer’s disease takes away the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. To help determine whether patients have this particular brain disease, doctors talk to the patients and their close family members about any recent challenges or changes in behavior or memory. They also administer a mental status exam in an office setting, and possibly do a short neuro-psych evaluation. While a cure for Alzheimer’s remains elusive, researchers have made some progress when it comes to finding treatments that may be able to slow the progression of the disease. So far, two drugs have received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration. How it’s diagnosed Dementia A doctor must find that you have two cognitive or behavioral areas in decline to diagnose dementia. These areas are disorientation, disorganization, language impairment, mood change, personality change and memory loss. To make an evaluation, a doctor (often a specialist such as a psychiatrist, neurologist or geriatric medicine physician) typically takes a patient history and administers several mental-skill challenges. Thanks to growing medical consensus that irritability, depression and anxiety often flag dementia before memory issues do (and official changes to the diagnostic criteria to reflect this), doctors also ask more about changes in mood or personality, Lyketsos notes. To check for cognitive decline, a doctor will ask whether a patient is experiencing just forgetfulness or, potentially more indicative of dementia, also having trouble figuring out calculations such as a restaurant tip, Petersen says. A physical exam can be important for flagging something like specific types of dementia caused by vascular disease (strokes) or Parkinson’s disease. Next, a standard and fairly brief round of memory and thinking tests is given in the same office visit. In the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, for example, you try to memorize and then recall a list of 12 words — and a few similar words may be thrown in to challenge you. Another test — also used to evaluate driving skills — has you draw lines to connect a series of numbers and letters in a complicated sequence. Video: How I Discovered I Had Early-Onset Alzheimer's Alzheimer’s Doctors use several different methods to determine if an individual has Alzheimer’s disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. Physical and mental evaluations are often part of this process. Memory and problem-solving tests are also used. With Alzheimer’s in particular, the progression and timing of symptoms is important. To identify this degenerative brain disease, doctors are looking for “a gradual, insidious onset that is slowly getting worse,” Petersen says. Until fairly recently (before the early 2000s), a conclusive diagnosis was not possible until an autopsy was performed and the brain examined for the physical hallmarks of the disease — beta-amyloid and tau, proteins that look like plaques and tangles in the brain. Now, a patient can get a PET scan or cerebrospinal fluid sampling that can show, with high accuracy, whether such plaques or tangles are present. But a high percentage of patients never get such a test, doctors say. For one, these tests are invasive. They’re also expensive and typically are not covered by insurance, though this could change in the future as more Alzheimer’s treatments become available. Researchers are hopeful that faster, less-expensive tests will be available soon, like a blood test to diagnose the disease in the doctor’s office, or even to identify someone at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s.

https://www.aarp.org/health/brain-health/alzheimers-diagnosis-before-symptoms/,"Is It Too Soon to Diagnose Alzheimer’s in People With No Symptoms? Some say new criteria could spark worry before life-saving therapies are available By Esther Landhuis, AARP Reviewed by Jason Karlawish, M.D. Comments En español Published March 05, 2025 Getty Images Would you want to know you have Alzheimer’s disease years before symptoms of memory loss and confusion set in? An expert committee says that’s now possible. According to their new criteria, published last June, a doctor can diagnose the disease purely from the results of a brain scan, a spinal tap or a simple blood test. Like cancer, diabetes and other illnesses that are routinely detected by biological markers in people with no symptoms, Alzheimer’s can be traced to an abnormal buildup of two proteins — amyloid and tau — well in advance of any changes in memory, personality or behavior that might emerge years later. But just because it’s possible to detect those markers of Alzheimer’s, does it make sense to do so? And what does this label mean for a person who may or may not ever experience symptoms at a time when few treatment options exist? Earlier diagnosis doesn’t guarantee better outcomes First, some context: The new diagnostic criteria are not surprising. They come on the heels of two milestones — the availability of new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration as disease-slowing treatments, and research showing that new blood tests are reliable, which expands the options for diagnosing the disease. Blood tests are much cheaper and easier to administer than brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and can detect disease biology about as well. In fact, blood tests can identify people with early-stage Alzheimer’s more accurately than standard evaluations by primary care physicians and even dementia specialists. A leading blood test measures both Alzheimer’s biomarkers — a modified form of the protein tau, called p-tau217, and several versions of amyloid (amyloid-β 42 and amyloid-β 40). Amyloid accumulates very early in the disease; p-tau217 shows up later, at a stage of disease when neurons are dying. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits So the question of whether doctors can diagnose Alzheimer’s just from biological markers is “an undisputed yes,” says Andrew Budson, M.D., professor of neurology at Boston University and director of the Center for Translational Cognitive Neuroscience at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System. “You can, in the same way that you can diagnose cancer with a mammogram or colonoscopy.” But can does not mean should. To be clear, even the authors of the new diagnostic criteria, the Alzheimer’s Association Workgroup, say they don’t recommend blood tests for people who show no signs of cognitive impairment, although that nuance is somewhat buried in the report. That’s in large part because the medications that reduce levels of amyloid in the brain — Leqembi (lecanemab) and Kisunla (donanemab) — have only shown benefits in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild-stage dementia, and their potential side effects can be serious. To date, “we have zero evidence … that treating people with just amyloid in their brain leads to any positive outcome,” says Eric Widera, M.D., professor of medicine and clinician-educator in geriatric medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Those studies, called AHEAD and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, described below, are happening now. Widera is a member of the International Working Group, or IWG, researchers from 17 countries who published a 2024 paper in JAMA Neurology cautioning against diagnosing people with Alzheimer’s disease based solely on biology without signs of dementia. The IWG and others warn that the availability of blood tests can cause undue worry for people who test positive without getting appropriate counseling on how to interpret the results. “They’ll be confused because they’ll know they don’t have Alzheimer’s dementia … but they’ll start to notice every problem with their memory,” says Deborah Blacker, M.D., geriatric psychiatrist and epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. In reality, not every memory blip is cause for concern; some are due to inattentiveness (you lost your keys because you were distracted when you walked in the door), or lack of sleep or even certain medications. Importantly, most people with amyloid in their brain make it through life free of dementia. Having tau in the brain increases risk, but not to 100 percent. In a 2018 computer modeling study that estimated probabilities of disease progression based on amyloid status and other factors such as age and national death rates, fewer than 1 in 4 cognitively normal 75-year-old women who test positive for amyloid go on to develop Alzheimer’s dementia during their lifetime. For men at the same age, that figure is 1 in 5. It’s been known for decades that many who die with normal cognition have “a head full of amyloid,” Blacker says. For a 75-year-old woman with both amyloid and tau in her brain, the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s dementia is closer to 1 in 3. “There’s a lot that needs to go wrong for something as important as cognition to fail,” adds Fanny Elahi, M.D., a neurologist-scientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “We actually are very resilient.” Test results may cause unnecessary alarm When people hear “Alzheimer’s disease,” most imagine the dreadful condition that robs a person’s memory and thinking skills — not an abnormal test result. A blood test measures biology, Elahi says. “It doesn’t equate to dementia. It doesn’t mean [those testing positive] are ‘doomed.’ ” Still, the psychological impact of biomarker tests on people with no apparent impairment is murky. Some worry that disclosing test results may invite possible discrimination in employment, housing and insurance. But since “we know there is biology that contributes to Alzheimer’s-related dementia,” she adds, a test tells someone they are at higher risk for dementia. What the test cannot measure is when someone might develop a life-altering disease — or whether they will at all. While a positive test doesn’t signify Alzheimer’s-related dementia, “a negative test doesn’t mean you won’t develop a different neurodegenerative disorder,” Daniel Press, a cognitive neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote in an email. “I guess my main advice would be to talk it through with an expert before getting [a test].” Some scientists liken the Alzheimer’s blood test to a PSA test, which detects a protein whose high levels could signal prostate cancer, yet often isn’t cause for alarm. Since many prostate tumors grow slowly, “more people die with prostate cancer than from it,” Blacker says. Similarly, Elahi perceives the buildup of amyloid — as well as tau — as a lifelong continuum. “Everyone who lives is on that continuum,” she says. The big unknown is how long it will take these proteins to reach a tipping point and trigger dementia. For one person it could happen when they’re 50 years old, for another at age 90, and for another never, Elahi says. A major benefit of identifying people at early stages of disease is that this is when they’re most likely to respond to treatments being tested in clinical research studies — and while there’s still time to make lifestyle changes. There is accumulating research suggesting that everyday actions — such as ongoing exercise, healthy eating and managing stress — can reduce a person’s risk of dementia. If a test result will move a person to change their lifestyle, there’s benefit, Elahi says. But if it causes someone to become depressed and lose hope, that’s not helpful. The psychological impacts are important. As is how the test results are used. “This, I think, is true for every diagnostic test that has ever become available. Interpretation … and communication of what that result means is everything,” she says. The AHEAD study aims to address the question of whether the disease-slowing drug Leqembi might work for people with no symptoms. The National Institutes of Health and Eisai, one of the drug’s developers, are funding the research. Enrollment closed in September 2024, with more than 1,600 people ages 55 to 80, who are amyloid-positive but show no signs of cognitive decline, randomly assigned to receive infusions of either Leqembi or a placebo once every two to four weeks for four years. Results are expected by late 2028 or early 2029. A similar study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, is testing Kisunla in people with “preclinical Alzheimer’s,” described as no cognitive decline but signs of amyloid and tau in their brain. ​Esther Landhuis is a science and health journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area who formerly covered Alzheimer’s and other degenerative diseases for Alzforum.

For instance, your muscle tone plays a role as you age. Carrying excess weight puts you at a higher risk for high blood pressure, gallstones, breathing problems and certain cancers. To get a better read on the health risks associated with your weight, your doctor may combine BMI with a waist circumference measurement called the waist-to-hip ratio — your waist measurement divided by hip measurement. If most of your fat is around your waist, rather than at your hips, you’re at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk increases with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. Research shows waist-to-hip ratio may be an even stronger predictor of an early death from any cause than the BMI, with higher waist-to-hip ratios increasing the risk. Weight loss is strongly recommended for people with obesity. Even a weight loss of just 5 to 10 percent of your current weight will help lower your risk of developing diseases. A reasonable and safe rate of weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds per week. Tips for People Over 50 With Obesity Open All 1. Try a prescriptive diet A balanced diet is generally fine for good health. But if your BMI puts you in the obesity category, it can help to follow a proven meal plan, such as a low-fat, low-carb or Mediterranean diet — whatever best matches your lifestyle. Some people have success with intermittent fasting, which involves not eating for certain hours of the day or days of the week. Besides helping you drop excess pounds, it also may improve health conditions like heart disease and diabetes. 2. Start moving gradually If you have been sedentary, ease into activity. Walking, swimming or using a recumbent bicycle or an elliptical machine are easy on the joints and unlikely to lead to injury. As you gain confidence and endurance, you can work out harder. If you have chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes, check with your doctor first. 3. Avoid or limit processed and ultra-processed foods People who eat lots of processed foods (prepared and packaged goods) are heavier than those who eat more whole and unprocessed meals. Instead of breakfast cereal out of a box, eat oatmeal and fresh fruit, for instance. Research shows that when people eat processed foods, the hormones that increase hunger rise and those that suppress appetite decrease. 3. Ask your doctor about weight-loss medications or surgery There are new drugs and combinations of older drugs that have been shown to be effective. You may be a candidate for those if you have a BMI of 30 or more. 5. Consider weight-loss surgery If you have a BMI of 40 or more, ask your doctor about surgical options.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/swearing-during-workout/,"Can Swearing During Exercise Improve Your Workout? Dropping a choice word or two during your next strength-training session may give you a boost By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published May 05, 2025 A profanity-laced workout may be just what you need for an extra edge. Jade Shulz It’s not often that your potty mouth is granted a pass, but that’s exactly what a growing body of research offers anyone looking to improve their workouts, including the millions of older adults who hit the gym regularly. Experts have known for a while that taboo words (and we aren’t talking dang or darn) have the power to help us release a range of emotions, both positive and negative. Turns out, that very quality comes in handy during certain types of exercise. In a landmark study published in 2018 in the journal Psychology of Sport and Exercise, a team of researchers — working off a hunch that dropping the F-bomb during exercise can improve power and strength — asked participants to choose a swear word they might use in response to accidentally banging their head﻿. They were then asked to repeat that swear word every three seconds during a 30-second, high-intensity cycling test that measures muscle strength and power﻿. Participants were also asked to repeat a swear word for 10 seconds before undergoing a test measuring grip strength and to continue repeating their swear word throughout the test. In both instances, researchers found that swearing improved performance: It increased peak and average power on the cycling test by 4.5 percent, on average, and grip strength by 8 percent, on average, compared to repeating a non-swear word. In a separate study, published in 2022, participants were asked to do chair push-ups, which involve using your hands to raise your body off a chair and holding the position for as long as possible. Those who repeated a swear word while doing so could hold the position for 10 percent longer than those who repeated a neutral word. WTF is going on? The power of profanity Experts aren’t entirely sure why four-letter words have such superpowers during a sweat session. What they do know is that “swearing might trigger a fight-or-flight response, increasing adrenaline and helping people push through physical discomfort,” says Greg Chertok, a certified mental performance consultant at Telos Sport Psychology Coaching. At the same time, the body typically has what’s known as an analgesic response, which increases your pain tolerance. “Swearing helps reduce pain perception, making exercise feel less painful, even when you’re pushing yourself to your limits,” Chertok explains. “There’s also research suggesting that swearing has psychological benefits, such as improving confidence, which could certainly be beneficial in a workout context.” Using expletives to improve physical performance has been shown to work only with moves that are relatively short and intense, Chertok says, meaning strength training exercises like lifting weights and power-building exercises such as kettlebell swings and squat jumps. The same isn’t true of cardio, he adds. ﻿ But that’s not to say there aren’t benefits to a little strategic swearing during your daily power walk, weekly spin class or run around the neighborhood. A study published in 2024 in the Journal of Exercise Physiology suggests that while swearing during intense cardio aerobic activity doesn’t impact endurance, it may make a bad mood a little better.﻿ What’s more, the study found that scores gauging mood and fatigue were worse with neutral words than with curse words. How to practice strategic swearing Swearing in the name of upping your workout isn’t the same as run-of-the-mill, anger-fueled spontaneous swearing directed at, say, the driver who abruptly switches lanes and causes you to swerve, missing another driver by this much. No, strategic swearing involves more control and, ahem, discipline. Where to begin? First off, pick a swear word. The most effective ones are personally meaningful and/or pack an emotional punch, says Nick Washmuth, a researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, who studies the beneficial effects and real-world usefulness of swearing. For most people, suggests a review of research published in 2024 in Frontiers in Psychology, that tends to be the F word or the S word. Whatever it is, you should use it as you would any piece of strength-training equipment: Unabashedly and at a steady clip. In other words, suggests Washmuth, swear out loud using normal speech volume — not whispering, not shouting﻿ — and repeat your chosen swear word just before the physically challenging move and then about once every one to five seconds during the move. As for the swearing averse, unfortunately, a robust dadgummit! fudge! or shoot! won’t get the job done. “Evidence suggests only actual swear words produce the desired psychophysiological effects,” Washmuth says. ﻿ Something else to keep in mind: You should use your self-designated swear word judiciously. Curse words are stripped of their superpower when used to excess, diminishing their emotional charge. ﻿ For those who avoid swearing, that’s good news. “If you rarely swear, you might actually experience a greater psychophysiological response when you do swear, leading to bigger performance benefits,” Washmuth says. “For strategic use, it may be wise to save swearing for special occasions — like tough workouts — to maximize its impact.” Adds Chertok: “The words we choose to use have a very real chemical effect.” For example, even though research suggests only actual swear words have the power to improve physical performance, Chertok believes “singular words like banana and vomit would induce microscopically different psychophysiological responses within us.” ﻿ Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

There’s no magic number for how often a person should have a bowel movement, but if you aren’t going at least three times per week or have trouble passing stool, you might have a form of constipation, according to the National Institute on Aging. This common condition affects 26 percent of women and 16 percent of men age 65 and up. This increases to 34 percent of women and 26 percent of men age 84 and older, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Read on the learn the causes and treatments to help you go more regularly. Causes of constipation Having a difficult time going to the bathroom gets worse as we age. Culprits include a lack of fiber in the diet, not drinking enough water, inactivity, medications, supplements, hormonal fluctuations, bowel disorders and conditions that affect movement, like Parkinson’s disease. I If you are struggling and straining on the toilet, you are more likely to have hemorrhoids, inflamed veins around your lower rectum, which about half of people age 50 have them according to the National Institutes of Health. In addition, with joint issues, or osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, can affect how well and often people move around. So, limitation in physical activity is a very big thing, says Margaret Schwiesow, gastroenterologist with Kaiser Permanente in Falls Church, VA. Stress and trauma also play a role in digestive issues. Bessel van der Kolk, M.D. talks about how the body stores trauma in his best seller “The Body Keeps The Score,” and addresses the delicate equilibrium in our mind–body connection. From the book, “Traumatized people chronically feel unsafe inside their bodies: The past is alive in the form of gnawing interior discomfort. Their bodies are constantly bombarded by visceral warning signs, and, in an attempt to control these processes, they often become expert at ignoring their gut feelings and in numbing awareness of what is played out inside.” Medications such as antidepressants to treat mental health conditions caused by stress and trauma can also affect digestion and cause constipation. The good news is that there’s a lot of options for you to get relief. What helps with constipation? The good news is there are lots of options to help you feel better. Here are eight things you can do to help you get relief. 1. Water “My simple rule of thumb for people is minimum half your body weight in ounces of water a day,” says gastroenterologist Robynne Chutkan, M.D. who sees patients at Georgetown University Hospital. She is the author of four books on gut health and host of the podcast Gutbliss where she discusses constipation and other GI ills. “I recommend first thing in the morning, because when you drink a big glass of water, that triggers something called the gastrocolic reflex, which is the message your stomach sends to your colon to say food is coming in or drink is coming in,” she says, which stimulates the colon to contract. Water can also help fiber move through the digestive system, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Not getting enough water can result in dried stool that is difficult to pass. 2. Fiber How to Add More Fiber to Your Diet Increase healthy fiber with these foods, including grams of fiber per serving size. Split peas (boiled): 1 cup, 16 grams Lentils (boiled): 1 cup, 15.5 grams Prunes: 1 cup, 12 grams Chia seeds: 1 ounce, 10 grams Raspberries: 1 cup, 8 grams Kiwis: 1 cup, 5 grams Oat bran muffin: 1 medium, 5 grams Broccoli: 1 cup, 5 grams Oatmeal, instant, cooked: 1 cup, 4 grams Almonds: 1 ounce, 3.5 grams Strawberries: 1 cup, 3 grams Source: High-fiber foods - Mayo Clinic There are two types of fiber you can eat to optimize digestion. Insoluble fiber: These types of fiber — raw veggie and fruit skin, seeds, nuts, and leafy greens — evacuates the body in the same condition in went in.Soluble fiber: These types of fiber — apples (no skin), cooked veggies, oatmeal — dissolves in the digestive system. The elephant in the room, according to Schwiesow, is the lack of fiber. To optimize gut health you need 25 to 30 grams per day, but she said some people are not meeting the minimum requirements and suffering the consequence. She reminds her patients fiber is in more than fruits and vegetables but also in nuts and legumes. She champions kiwis as a superfood to add to their diet. The skin is edible too and can increase the fiber content by 50 percent, although it might seem strange to eat given its fuzzy texture. Schwiesow tells her patients to think of fiber as a brush that goes through your colon, and it sweeps down all the and the toxins from your entire digestive system. 3. Does coffee make you poop? Yes, your morning cup of joe can help you go, according to a 2022 article in the journal Nutrients. Coffee stimulates the colon and releases a hormone that triggers the gallbladder to release bile and digestive enzymes to assist with the emptying of the bowels. The more coffee you consume, the odds of you having constipation decrease, according to a study of more than 13,000 coffee drinkers. Decaf also works but it triggers the colon less than caffeinated brew. Schwiesow recommends her patients who like coffee should have one cup to get things moving. She also cites health benefits of coffee, which has plenty of polyphenols — nutrients in plants that manage inflammation — or antioxidants, which are vitamins and nutrients that can protect your health. Not a coffee connoisseur? Sip hot water with lemon or hot tea to get some relief. The heat of the drink stimulates the bowels. 4. Exercise Strength training and cardiovascular exercise, according to Schwiesow, can help with digestion and ease constipation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says you need about 150 minutes of exercise per week, which is a 21-minute walk per day. Chutkan says the best time to walk is after a meal because it stimulates digestion and helps move the food through your digestive system. The worst thing you can do after eating is sitting on the couch. How to Add More Fiber to Your Diet Increase healthy fiber with these foods, including grams of fiber per serving size. Split peas (boiled): 1 cup, 16 grams Lentils (boiled): 1 cup, 15.5 grams Prunes: 1 cup, 12 grams Chia seeds: 1 ounce, 10 grams Raspberries: 1 cup, 8 grams Kiwis: 1 cup, 5 grams Oat bran muffin: 1 medium, 5 grams Broccoli: 1 cup, 5 grams Oatmeal, instant, cooked: 1 cup, 4 grams Almonds: 1 ounce, 3.5 grams Strawberries: 1 cup, 3 grams Source: High-fiber foods - Mayo Clinic 5. Pelvic floor therapy A pelvic floor physical therapy can check for weak muscles and spasms by performing a pelvic exam and, for women, a rectal exam. “Physical Therapy is, I think, a great tool that's underused, in particular pelvic floor physical therapy for a woman,” says Chutkan who describes the pelvic floor is like a hammock. In this hammock women have GI organs and reproductive organs. As we get older, that pelvic floor tends to weaken and fall. And so “I see a lot of pelvic floor issues, more in women than men, but sometimes in men.” Denise Moon, physical therapist and a specialist in pelvic floor disorders at Pivot Therapy in North Beach, Maryland. She advises patients to exercise. “I always tell patients that the best kind of exercise is the exercise that they enjoy the most. Through making lifestyle changes and adding movement to their lives, I can see changes as soon as one to two sessions with my patients with constipation.” 6. Yoga Moon suggests yoga and Pilates because both work on belly breathing, working the abdominal core and posture, all which are key concepts in treating constipation. The practice of yoga can improve digestive health and improve quality of sleep in older people, according to a randomized trial which showed improvements in both after three months. Participants in the study reported a better quality of life. Although this was a small study, the improvements were significant and show promise for more people going forward. Other research studied meditation and yoga for IBS. When seventy-nine people participated in a virtual yoga practice, IBS symptoms decreased for 54.7 percent of the group during the 8-week period, according to a 2023 article published in the journal American Journal of Gastroenterology . 7. Acupuncture People can try alternative therapies, like the ancient practice of acupuncture, to reduce constipation symptoms and reduce some types of pain. Studies show acupuncture can increase the number of stools and relieve constipation by changing the gut, stimulating the muscles in the digestive system, and reducing stress. In a randomized controlled trial, researchers found that acupuncture increased bowel movements from less than once per week to 2.6 times per week during an 8-week treatment of 536 people. 8. Magnesium citrate A few types of magnesium are available over the counter, but the one you want for constipation relief is magnesium citrate. This supplement draws water into the intestine and helps you go, according to the Cleveland Clinic. As with any new medication or supplement, be sure to ask your doctor if this is safe for you because it could interact with certain medications, like those to increase bone strength. Types of Constipation Constipation shows up in a few different ways Normal-transit constipation: Occurs when people have difficulty fully evacuating the colon. They may experience abdominal pain, distension (when the abdomen juts out). People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or emotional stress, typically have this type of constipation. Slow-transit constipation: Passing the stool through the colon is delayed. This happens more to women than men, due in part to hormonal fluctuations. Outlet constipation: Also called pelvic floor dysfunction, people with this type of issue have severe difficulty expelling stools. The combination of hydration, movement, nutrition, and stress management can help alleviate constipation. If you are having frequent bouts of it, you should see your doctor or a GI specialist.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/peripheral-vision-loss/,"Peripheral Vision Loss: Why It Happens and What You Can Do About It This type of vision loss is frightening and can be sudden or gradual – but it isn’t always permanent By Alexa Pellegrini, AARP Medically reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments Published December 18, 2024 As peripheral vision loss advances, it's common to feel as you are looking through a small hole. Getty Images In this story • What is peripheral vision? • What peripheral vision loss looks like • Peripheral vision loss and ageing • Diagnosing peripheral vision loss • Causes and treatments • Driving with peripheral vision loss • Improve your peripheral vision You trip or bump into doors, walls and furniture more often. Playing catch with your grandkids is a challenge. Navigating crowds without colliding into others is difficult. You struggle to see clearly driving at night. These are all common signs of peripheral vision loss, also known as tunnel vision, a symptom of many eye diseases and total-body health conditions that affect some older adults. It’s best to catch peripheral vision loss early, yet it’s not uncommon for many people to not even notice it until it’s progressed to a point where it is impacting your daily life. Here’s why it’s so tricky to spot compared with central vision loss and tips to keep your eyes healthy. What is peripheral vision? First, it’s important to understand what peripheral vision means. Peripheral vision is seeing off to the right side and off to the left side of your body, or upwards or downwards while looking straight ahead and not turning your head. However, peripheral vision loss can actually affect either the periphery of both eyes together or only one eye. As a result, some older adults think that they have normal peripheral vision because if only one eye is affected, the brain uses information from the other eye to help you see, so they won’t notice it. Consider that in a 2020 survey﻿ conducted by Johnson & Johnson Vision, most adults agreed that healthy vision is linked to quality of life, but only 46 percent of respondents scheduled an annual eye exam﻿. A key reason they skipped their visit? Not noticing any changes to their vision. Peripheral vision is how you see to the right side and the left side of your body, or upwards or downwards, while looking straight ahead. Shutterstock What does peripheral vision loss look like? Numerous diseases and conditions can lead to peripheral vision loss. The condition can be invisible or barely noticeable when a disease is in an early stage, as in the case of glaucoma. If unnoticed, peripheral vision loss can progress to more severe narrowing of the visual field, or it manifests as darkness and blurriness only at the outermost edges of one or both eyes. As it advances, it can create a type of tunnel vision, as if you are looking through a peephole that keeps getting smaller and smaller. This is part of the reason it makes it harder for people with peripheral vision to drive at night. Eye exams 101 The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults get a complete eye examination at age 40 (earlier if you have an eye disease or risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or a family history of eye disease). After that exam, your eye care provider can tell you how often you should have your eyes checked in the future. If you are 65 or older, you should get your eyes checked every year or two, the group says. Is it normal to lose peripheral vision with age? Ageing causes the peripheral visual field to narrow between one to three degrees per decade, so it’s impossible for it to remain completely intact later in life. But pronounced peripheral vision loss is not just a normal part of getting older, especially if it’s sudden. Plus, some factors within your control can hurt the eyes, such as inflammation caused by acute or chronic stress and anxiety. “Believing that you have control over your life and your vision will help you be more proactive about your health and lower your stress,” says Professor Bernhard Sabel, Ph.D. and founder of the world-renowned Savir-Center for vision restoration in Magdeburg, Germany. “Stress can make our vision worse by constricting the muscles around the blood vessels that give neurons in the retina and the brain sufficient energy."" Peripheral vision is how you see to the right side and the left side of your body, or upwards or downwards, while looking straight ahead.

After that exam, your eye care provider can tell you how often you should have your eyes checked in the future. If you are 65 or older, you should get your eyes checked every year or two, the group says. How is peripheral vision loss diagnosed? Ophthalmologists and optometrists usually test your peripheral vision as part of a routine eye exam. Abnormalities will trigger further testing. An ophthamologist may perform a peripheral vision test during an exam. Getty Images For instance, you might take an automated static perimetry test. To ensure the results are as accurate as possible, you’ll wear a patch over the unaffected eye and a prescription lens over the affected eye. Then, you’ll stare at a target inside the center of a bowl-shaped instrument called a perimeter. Each time you see a light flash around the target, you’ll press a button; the machine tracks which lights you don’t see, giving your provider a sense of how well your peripheral vision works. What are some of the most common causes of peripheral vision loss in older adults? Glaucoma What it is: Glaucoma can be caused by elevated pressure and fluid in the eye that damages the optic nerve over time, or in cases when the eye pressure is normal it may be caused by lack of proper blood supply resulting in vision problems, unusual headaches and eye pain. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, the disease affects around 3 million Americans — and half of them don’t even know they have it. Having a family history of the disease and being a member of certain ethnic groups increase your risk. “Glaucoma is the number one cause of blindness in the African American community,” says Dr. Ruben Sanchez, an ophthalmologist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California. “So, there is a higher risk of both developing glaucoma and losing vision from glaucoma if you’re of that ethnicity. And if glaucoma runs in your family, it’s really important that you’re routinely screened for it at regular intervals.” As it progresses, glaucoma makes older adults vulnerable to serious falls and fractures, and the fear of progressively going blind can lead to anxiety and depression. How to prevent it: It’s essential to manage diabetes and high blood pressure, two major risk factors.﻿ Sabel’s recommendation: “The other thing you can do that we recommend to our patients is to drink more water. Hydrating can also enhance blood flow to the eyes. I recommend a half a gallon per day.” How to treat it: “If glaucoma is caught in the early stages, then the first-line treatment is using eye drops, many of which do not have systemic side effects. Some of them do, but overall, eye drops have a very low-risk profile,” Sanchez says. If glaucoma isn’t well controlled with eye drops, surgery is the next option. Read more on treatments for glaucoma. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) What it is: The most advanced stage of diabetic eye disease where the retina grows new blood vessels (neovascularization). These fragile blood vessels break and release blood that causes floaters, blurriness, fluctuating vision, peripheral vision loss and central vision loss. It can even trigger tractional retinal detachment, Sanchez explains, which can lead to profound vision loss. An ophthamologist may perform a peripheral vision test during an exam. Getty Images How to prevent it: In five years or less, roughly two percent of type 2 diabetes patients will develop PDR. And the risk increases with time. Even if you take ﻿metformin, insulin or weight loss drugs commonly prescribed to diabetics such as Ozempic, making healthy changes to stabilize your blood sugar and lose weight is essential for preventing PDR from occurring or progressing. Be mindful of how much sugar you eat, get enough sleep, keep your stress levels under control, get moving every day and avoid drugs and alcohol. How to treat it: Your doctor may prescribe medications like Avastin and Eylea, which may slow or even improve PDR-induced vision loss. If you have advanced PDR, your doctor may use laser surgery to seal the tiny, leaking blood vessels. Another surgical option is to replace the clear, viscous gel behind the lens and in front of the retina with another solution, but it comes with risks such as retinal detachment, developing cataracts, lens damage, problems with eye movement and infection. Is it safe to drive with peripheral vision loss? Many states let low-vision drivers take the roads. To see if you meet the minimum vision requirements to drive, visit your state’s DMV website. However, it’s not uncommon for even mild peripheral vision loss to make older drivers too nervous to take the wheel. Peripheral vision loss can also affect your ability to drive at night, because the peripheral area of the retina contains photoreceptor cells called rods that are responsible for night vision. Brushing up on your driving skills is one solution. “If you’re doubting your ability to drive, you should take a few lessons at driving school,” Sabel says. “But don’t tell the driving instructor that you have peripheral vision loss. Instead, ask them to evaluate if you can still safely drive. You might say, ‘I’m getting older, and I’m unsure if I should still drive. Can I take a few lessons and get your insights?’ ” Stroke What it is: Reduced blood flow to the brain (ischemic) or uncontrolled bleeding in the brain (hemorrhage) that leads to a life-threatening emergency. More than 795,000 U.S. Americans suffer from stroke each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). And peripheral vision loss is a common complication: A study published in PloS One that examined more than 1,000 stroke patients found that 73 percent of survivors experienced impaired vision. How to prevent it: Kick your vices – and prioritize your mental health. For one, research shows that any form of smoking can increase the chances of ischemic stroke, and so does ongoing mental stress. How to treat it: In the event of a stroke, it’s important to act quickly and call 911. If an ischemic stroke patient is seen within three hours of onset, doctors can use tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to break down the blood clot to enhance blood flow or other medical procedures to open a blockage and restore blood flow. Hemorrhagic stroke may require aneurysm clipping or coil embolization to stop the bleeding, plus high blood pressure medications to help lower your blood pressure that may be contributing to or causing the bleeding. Video: Signs of Retinal Detachment Retinal detachment What it is: The thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that helps us convert light into images (the retina) detaches or pulls away from its normal position and disconnects from blood vessels that nourish the eyes. This can be a gradual process (with ageing) or more sudden, due to trauma. Many patients report a sudden increase in floaters, flashes of light﻿ and abrupt or gradual peripheral vision loss. If left untreated, retinal detachment will result in partial or total blindness. How to prevent it: Age-related changes to the vitreous gel increase the likelihood of retinal detachment, as does severe nearsightedness and head and eye injury. You can lower your risk by managing all forms of diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases, such as retinal thinning. It’s also important to take preventative measures and address comorbidities, such as diabetes. How to treat it: If this is caught early, your surgeon will use a laser or freezing (cryopexy) technique to reattach your retina to the back of the eye again. In the case of a larger retinal detachment, you may need surgery. Can you improve your peripheral vision? Getting regular eye care and engaging in a healthy lifestyle of exercise and healthy eating can help improve general eye health and peripheral vision, particularly by keeping your blood pressure in a healthy range and staying on top of diabetes if you have the condition. There’s research showing that in combination with a healthy lifestyle, supplements may help improve your peripheral vision. Sabel suggests speaking with your doctor about supplementing your diet with AREDS2, a multivitamin that received its name from Age-Related Eye Disease Studies supported by the National Eye Institute. AREDS2 contains vitamin C, vitamin E, copper, zinc and other powerful nutrients that may help your vision. You should also get a comprehensive blood test to see if you have a B12 deficiency, or other vitamin deficiencies that trigger inflammation in the eye and the rest of the body. But the best way older adults can boost their vision is by catching problems before they start. “Every person after the age of 60 should get regular vision screenings,” Sanchez says. “So, whether that’s with an optometrist or an ophthalmologist, we need to check the health and the function of the optic nerve.” It’s the most effective way to spot the warning signs of glaucoma before they progress and cause noticeable vision loss, he explains. The same goes for other diseases of the eye. Is it safe to drive with peripheral vision loss? Many states let low-vision drivers take the roads. To see if you meet the minimum vision requirements to drive, visit your state’s DMV website. However, it’s not uncommon for even mild peripheral vision loss to make older drivers too nervous to take the wheel.

Can I take a few lessons and get your insights?’ ” Video: Signs of Retinal Detachment Alexa Pellegrini is a journalist and senior digital producer at AARP.org.

It may not make up for the bloating and bellyache, but if it’s any consolation, know that you’re not alone. About 16 percent of U.S. adults experience constipation, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). And when it comes to adults 60 and older, that percentage more than doubles. ﻿ What gives? “The GI (gastrointestinal) tract ages, just like the rest of a person’s body,” says William Chey, M.D., chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. Older adults also tend to take more medications than their younger peers, and many drugs and supplements can cause constipation, Chey adds. The good news is constipation can often be managed at home. Plenty of water and regular exercise can get — and keep — things moving. So can a few standout foods. Foods for constipation 1. Prunes Prunes are often hailed as the number one food to help you go number two — and for good reason. Prunes, which are just dehydrated plums, are packed with fiber, which helps keep food moving through the digestive system. They also contain the sugar alcohol sorbitol, which has a laxative effect, Chey explains. One study even found prunes to be more effective than psyllium (the active ingredient in Metamucil) for the treatment of mild to moderate constipation. Similarly, studies have found that prune juice is a safe and effective way to relieve constipation. There is a downside to prunes, however. They can cause gas and bloating — and the more you eat, the more likely you are to notice these effects, Chey says. 2. Kiwi Can’t deal with the unpleasant side effects from prunes? Grab a kiwi instead. Actually, make it two. A new study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that two kiwifruit a day helped to relieve constipation. Plus, research has shown that kiwi is better tolerated than prunes or psyllium, Chey says. 3. Oatmeal Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which helps to absorb water. Think of when you mix hot water into oatmeal and it starts to gel — that’s because of the soluble fiber, explains Ashley Baumohl, a registered dietitian in the division of gastroenterology at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. “Not only does [the fiber in oatmeal] help regulate your bowel movements, but it’s also actually softening them, making them easier to pass,” Baumohl says. Chia seeds — which also form a gel-like consistency when combined with water — is another example of a food high in soluble fiber. 4. Papaya Known for the beautiful orange hue of its ripened flesh, papaya can help jump-start a stalled digestive system. “Papaya has a lot of digestive enzymes, a lot of fiber and also some fructose, which for some people can cause a laxative effect,” Chey says. Mango is another fruit with similar traits. 5. Aloe vera juice Cruise the beverage aisle at your local grocery store and you may spot a thick liquid made from the aloe vera plant. A bottle of the stuff, known as aloe vera juice, comes packed with purported health benefits — from clearer skin to heartburn relief. The low-sugar juice can also help with constipation, Chey says, along with another plant, fresh rhubarb. “They actually offer a stimulant effect﻿; they stimulate your colon to contract and can help with constipation in that way,” Chey says. A few other tips: In addition to the foods above, a wide range of fiber-filled fruits, veggies and other snacks can help keep you regular. Berries, though small in size, are mighty when it comes to gut health due to their fiber content. They’re also versatile, Baumohl says. You can put them in yogurt, pile them on top of oatmeal or enjoy them in a smoothie.If you’re reaching for an apple or pear, keep the skin on to up your fiber intake. And add vegetables like artichokes to pasta, Baumohl recommends.Reach for nuts and seeds, which are a good source of fiber and healthy fats.Keep your meals varied and avoid an all-white diet (white bread, potatoes), which can disrupt regularity, Baumohl says. ﻿Fiber is key when it comes to staying regular, but if you aren’t used to a fiber-rich diet, make sure you add it in slowly. It can be a shock to your GI system if you suddenly load up, Baumohl says. Beyond food, pay attention to your posture on the toilet since this can affect your bowel movements. Raising your feet, leaning back or squatting may make going to the bathroom a bit easier, according to the Cleveland Clinic. ﻿ If your constipation doesn’t let up, call your doctor. Medication may be able to help. You should also see a health care provider if constipation is a new problem for you, you see blood in your stool, you are losing weight unintentionally or you have severe pain with your bowel movements, the Cleveland Clinic says. Foods to avoid If you’re constipated, or are prone to it, best to steer clear of matzo, which is dehydrated unleavened bread. In fact, doctors often recommend it for people who have diarrhea, Chey says. The NIDDK also suggests avoiding fast food, highly processed food (hot dogs, frozen pizza, microwave dinners) and meat. Wondering about bananas? Go ahead and grab one, Chey says. They’re known to help with diarrhea, but they can also help with constipation. “Bananas contain a substance called pectin, which has water-holding capacity. So if you have excess water in your stool, it’ll bind up the water and make your stool more fully formed. But the nice thing about pectin is that if your stools are too hard, it’ll also hang on to water and make your stool softer,” Chey explains. A Recipe for Relief Feeling backed up? Grab the blender and make a smoothie. Just add: 4 ounces of aloe vera juice 4 ounces of chopped papaya 1 whole, peeled kiwifruit Some ice “It tastes really good, and it offers a mild laxative effect,” says William Chey, M.D., of the University of Michigan.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/reasons-to-visit-eye-doctor/,"How Often Should You Get an Eye Exam? 9 benefits of visiting your eye doctor after 50 By Jessica Migala, Updated September 12, 2024 AARP Reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published April 22, 2020 / Updated September 12, 2024 Illustration by Alicia Tatone More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health Most of us assume it’s natural for our eyesight to go as we age — and that notion can be dangerous. “No one’s eyes just get ‘bad with age,’ and you don’t just lose vision without a reason for it,” says Douglas Wisner, M.D., an ophthalmologist at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. Meaning: Don’t accept blurriness, spots, flashes or floaters — get yourself checked out. How often should you get your eyes checked after 50? Recommendations for the frequency of eye exams for older adults vary slightly and are dependent on your age, overall health and risk factors for eye disease: The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults get a complete eye examination at age 40 (earlier if you have an eye disease or risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or family history of eye disease). After that exam, your eye care provider can tell you how often you should have your eyes checked in the future. If you are 65 or older, you should get your eyes checked every year or two, the group says.The American Optometric Association recommends people at low risk for eye problems get exams at least every two years for ages 40-64 and annually at 65 and older.The National Institute on Aging has slightly different recommendations, advising that everyone over age 50 have an eye exam annually, or as recommended by their eye care provider, and every year or two after age 60. The right interval for you depends on whether you have other health conditions, such as diabetes, so talk to your eye doctor about the schedule you should follow. More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health Here are nine reasons to make eye checkups a priority: 1. There’s more to your eye than meets the eye With dilation, drops added to the eye widen the pupil, allowing your doctor to view the inside of the eye — including the retina, lens and optic nerve — and look for age-related macular degeneration, melanomas and glaucoma. “Examining an undilated eye is like looking through a keyhole into a room. Dilation opens the door completely, so you can see all the corners of the room,” says optometrist Laura Di Meglio, an assistant professor at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. Dilation is usually included in the price of your eye exam. For an extra fee, though, some private practices offer testing on newer retinal-imaging devices. “These machines capture a wide view of the retina, even with undilated eyes,” Di Meglio says. The wider view of the retina allows the doctor to see the sides of the eyeballs and detect abnormalities that may otherwise be missed with standard testing. 2. Eyes are a window into your health “The eye is the only place in the body where you can directly visualize nerves and blood vessels,” Wisner explains. Eye doctors scan your eye for conditions that affect blood vessels, including hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes — and can sometimes be the first to detect a problem. “Heart disease still remains one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality in our country, and if we pick up on it early enough, we can get on top of it and prevent damage,” he says. 3. A vision exam is brain-healthy, too What’s healthy for the eyes is healthy for the brain. Vision problems are associated with a higher risk of memory and thinking problems. In fact, older adults with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness had 72 percent higher odds of dementia compared to those without, according to a study in JAMA Ophthalmology. (Most types of untreated vision problems were associated with dementia.) Vision problems can be found — and addressed — at your eye doctor’s office. For example, you can get a prescription for glasses or be evaluated for cataract surgery. 4. You can stop switching glasses to read the paper Even if you don’t have a prescription for glasses, you still need an annual vision exam. Around age 40, people naturally begin to develop presbyopia, a condition in which the lens of the eye loses its ability to change shape and accommodate for different distances. “You can’t read things up close anymore, so you hold materials at an arm’s distance. But by age 55, most can’t struggle through it — their arm just isn’t long enough anymore,” Di Meglio says. Drugstore readers might suffice, but talk to your doctor about prescription readers or progressive lenses, which can improve depth perception. (Progressives take some getting used to, so inform your doctor if you’re at risk for falls.) 5. The latest contacts could change the way you see Use your yearly eye exam as an opportunity to discuss if there are contact lens options that can make your life easier. New materials can improve comfort and let contact lenses solve more than one vision issue at a time. For example, toric lenses can treat astigmatism, orthokeratology lenses help reshape the cornea to correct myopia (near-sightedness), and multifocal contacts combine multiple prescriptions in one lens. 6. You may be able to ditch wearing glasses forever Eye tests over 60 include screening for cataracts. A clouding of the lens of the eye, a cataract can develop so slowly that you may not notice the difference initially. For some, cataracts begin to grow in their 50s, or even at age 40. By age 80, more than half of Americans have had one. But cataract surgery can liberate some people from glasses altogether, Wisner says. The procedure is quick (one hour), downtime is short (no more than a few days), and new techniques mean that some people won’t need post-op eye drops. AARP/Shutterstock 7. You don’t need to drive with glare If night driving is becoming increasingly challenging, ask about antireflective lenses for your glasses, optometrist Barbara Horn suggests. “If your eyes are healthy with no or minimal cataracts, antireflective lenses are the most common solution,” she says. That said, for folks who are over age 75, nighttime driving almost doubles the risk of being injured in a traffic accident, research suggests. At an annual vision exam, your eye care provider can talk to you about ways to make driving at night — or during the day — safer and make sure you’re being treated for any eye-related diseases. 8. Those eye floaters could signal something bigger Regardless of how recently you’ve been to the eye doctor, you should also schedule a visit for an eye exam when something feels wrong with your vision. For example, with aging, the gel-like substance in the eyes, called the vitreous, begins to shrink; it may even separate from the retina, says Elena Roth, M.D., an ophthalmologist with the University of Miami Health System. One symptom of this might be seeing floaters and flashes in your vision. Most of the time you won’t need to be treated for floaters, but you will need to be closely followed by your doctor to watch for a retinal tear, a complication that can lead to vision loss. The good news is that those floaters usually stop bothering you eventually. “After three to six months, the brain learns to adjust and accommodate them,” Roth says. 9. If you have diabetes, see your eye doctor — it’s critical If you have diabetes, you have a 25-fold higher risk of developing blindness compared to the general population. Here’s where the importance of eye exams comes in: Most of that vision loss can be prevented when you see your ophthalmologist regularly to catch problems as they start. How often should you go to the eye doctor if you have diabetes? Every year. “Diabetes is a disease of blood vessels. In the eye, it causes bleeding and leakage of fluid in the retina, which can cause loss of vision,” Wisner says. That’s why an annual dilated exam is crucial. What’s going on in your eyes is a direct reflection of what’s happening in your kidneys, he adds; if a vision exam shows diabetes is not well controlled, you have an opportunity to take steps to preserve your eyesight — and the rest of your body.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/weight-loss-foods/,"14 Foods That Could Help You Lose Weight These tasty treats can curb cravings and optimize your weight-﻿loss journey By Nissa Simon, Updated December 23, 2024 AARP Medical review by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published March 20, 2024 / Updated December 23, 2024 Sarah Rogers (Source: Getty Images (4)) ​Though no one food is the magic fix for weight management﻿, there are options that, when combined in an overall healthy eating plan, can give you a leg up in your weight﻿-loss goals. Weight loss most importantly needs a calorie deficit, or energy deficit. So that means you could eat only “junk food” and still lose weight as long as you ate less calories than your body was using,” says Sarah Wagner, a registered dietician at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. “No one food can make you lose weight.” Still, Wagner emphasizes that choosing nutritious foods is key for overall health. These foods help keep you full, hydrate your body, and provide the nourishment needed to thrive. Fruits and vegetables are important in a healthy diet, but no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients you need. For overall health and weight goals, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and whole grains, among its other benefits, has a positive effect on blood sugar, helping to keep appetite in check and promote weight loss, according to Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate from the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Avoiding sugary beverages, which are high in calories and low in nutritional value﻿, is part of the weight-control picture﻿, as is adding foods with high protein and fiber to your grocery list. And, of course, although it’s not a dietary recommendation, remaining active plays a role in controlling weight. ​ Here are 14 foods that can help you reach your weight goals. Although these foods burn calories, consider them only part of the weight-loss effort, which also involves regular physical activity, adequate sleep and controlling stress. Foods to eat to lose weight 1. Apples These crunchy beauties are low in calories, high in fiber and filling, all attributes that benefit weight loss. A medium apple contains approximately 5 grams of fiber, enough to slow digestion so you don’t feel hungry after a snack or a meal. Apples also boast a high water content; about 85 percent of their weight is water, which helps to temper your appetite. According to the Cleveland Clinic, apples make a satisfying snack, and choosing a healthy snack over a doughnut can help you maintain a healthy weight. So grab an apple on your way out the door. You’ll look better and feel better. 2. Asparagus ﻿ Getty Images The delicate stalks of asparagus, which are harvested in spring, are low in fat and calories﻿ —﻿ really low. Half a cup, five cooked spears, contains only 20 calories, but those lovely stalks are high in soluble and insoluble fiber. Both types help keep you feeling full between meals because your body digests fiber slowly, so you’re less likely to get hungry. The downside: ﻿Asparagus contains a unique compound that gives urine a punky odor. Take heart: ﻿The odor generally dissipates within 24 to 48 hours. 3. Avocados What all avocados have in common, whether small or large, is that they’re pear-shaped, have creamy green flesh and a pit and are packed with calories. But those calories don’t necessarily mean that avocados will pack on pounds. People who eat avocados routinely tend to feel fuller for longer and eat less throughout the day. A study published in the journal Nutrients concluded that men and women who weren’t overweight to begin with and ate avocados regularly had lower odds of becoming overweight or obese. Getty Images 4. Broccoli Green heads of broccoli are available year﻿-round, mild in taste and,﻿ best of all, beneficial in weight loss. Water accounts for more than 90 percent of broccoli’s content. Carbs, protein and a little fat make up the rest. Broccoli, like other nonstarchy vegetables, is low in calories (about 35 per cup) and rich in fiber, making it a filling food that can help control weight. The leaves and stems of broccoli are nutritious, but the florets have an even higher concentration of nutrients and phytochemicals, naturally occurring chemical compounds produced by plants. However, you may want to introduce broccoli into your diet slowly; it has been known to increase intestinal gas and flatul﻿ence. 5. Fish For older adults looking to cut calories from fattier meats, fish—especially canned varieties packed in water—can be a great option. It’s loaded with omega-3 fats, rich in nutrients like vitamin D and selenium, high in protein, and low in saturated fat. Including one to two 3-ounce servings of fatty fish per week, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines, may lower the risk of dying from heart disease by 36%, according to a JAMA review of 20 studies. 6. Carrots Forget the Bugs Bunny jokes, it’s time to take carrots seriously. Research suggests that including fiber-rich carrots in your diet helps curb your appetite. If you want to lose weight, eat food that contains more water and fewer calories. Here’s where carrots come in. A medium raw carrot is about 88 percent water and contains only 25 calories. If you’ve had enough of orange carrots, the most popular color, you can also find red, purple, yellow and white carrots. 7. Cottage cheese People generally don’t think of cottage cheese as sophisticated or suave or worldly. But its lumpy looks hide a world of benefits, according to dietitian Julia Zumpano, of the Cleveland Clinic. Forget Swiss ﻿cheese or cheddar and head straight for cottage cheese, she advises. It’s high in protein, which helps curb your appetite and manage hormones associated with appetite and digestion. And﻿, believe it or not, cottage cheese has become trendy. For those with lactose intolerance, cottage cheese has lower levels than many dairy foods, and lactose-free cottage cheese is available. Getty Images 8. Eggs Whether you scramble them, hard-boil them or coddle them, eggs are a great way to start the day if you’re trying to take off extra pounds. They’re low in calories and packed with protein, which takes longer to digest, leaving you feeling satisfied and less likely to overeat at your next meal. An Australia﻿n study that provided either a breakfast of eggs and toast or cereal with milk and orange juice to overweight or obese men and women found that those who ate the egg breakfast felt less hungry and ate significantly less at lunch. Those concerned about their cholesterol may want to avoid or limit eating egg yolk﻿s and enjoy egg whites instead. For example, try an omelet with three egg whites and just one egg yolk. 9. Lentils and other pulses Lentils, chickpeas, beans and peas all belong to a plant family called legumes with edible seeds known as pulses. Eating about one serving a day of these nutritionally dense seeds promotes a feeling of satiety, a term researchers use when they mean a person has eaten enough to feel full. This satiety may lead to weight loss and better weight management. According to a study from the University of Toronto, participants lost an average of ¾ of a pound over six weeks﻿ ﻿b﻿y simply adding less than a cup of these seeds to their regular diet. Even more important, this modest amount seemed to prevent them from gaining it back. 10. Mushrooms Add sauteed mushrooms to your scrambled eggs in the morning for a great way to start the day. “Mushrooms can be an important part of a diet that helps with weight loss,” says Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Highly nutritious mushrooms contribute a savory flavor called umami to food without much in the way of fat or calories, so they may help people feel full for few calories, Glenn notes. 11. Oats Oatmeal, a soothing, old-fashioned breakfast standby, doesn’t look like much, but it packs a mighty punch. People who eat cooked oatmeal regularly have a lower risk of becoming overweight. A cup of cooked oatmeal contains about 160 calories﻿ —﻿ not much﻿ —﻿ and nearly ﻿4 grams of a soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which encourages a feeling of fullness and dampens the urge to overeat. To add pizzazz to your morning bowl of oatmeal, dress it up with apple slices, fresh berries and chopped nuts. Be cautious about “instant” oatmeal, which tends to be processed and could contain added sugar and sodium and less fiber content. 12. Nuts Contrary to what you might expect, studies associate consuming nuts of all kinds with less weight gain. A study in the journal Nutrients determined that eating more nuts may help prevent long-term weight gain. In particular, Brazil nuts contain the mineral selenium, which may improve the health of your thyroid, which regulates metabolism. However, nuts are packed with calories, so portion control is key﻿; aim for about a handful. 13. Pears Pears come in all shapes﻿ —﻿ round and plump, chubby, knobby as fists and, of course, pear-shaped. No matter what the fruit looks like, researchers concluded that men and women who made pears part of their everyday diet had a lower body weight than those who ignored them. The people who ate pears were 35 percent less likely to be obese﻿, and their diets were of higher quality. The study, published in Nutrition & Food Science, noted that people who ate pears had higher﻿-than﻿-usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper and potassium, all of them important for the body to function well. 14. Leafy Greens Arugula, romaine lettuce, spinach, kale, ‘spring mix,’ and other leafy greens are an excellent way to pack in nutrients without adding many calories. Even better for weight loss, they’re high in fiber, which helps keep you feeling full longer by slowing digestion, says Rush University System in Chicago. 4 Foods that sabotage weight-loss plans If you’re trying to lose weight, beware of the hidden calories in these supposed “health foods.” Here are four to avoid, courtesy of Emory University: Fruit-flavored yogurt Although yogurt is a healthy addition to a weight-loss diet, flavored yogurt is often boosted with added sugar﻿ —﻿ as much as 31 grams to a 6-ounce container. That’s almost 8 teaspoons of sugar! Ouch! Fast-food salads Beware the toppings on prepackaged salads. The dressings and add-ons can rack up as much as 500 unwanted calories. Enhanced water These drinks marketed as water typically contain artificial flavors and sweeteners. Refined grains Whole grains provide a ton of health benefits. They contain all parts of the grain, including fiber, B vitamins and essential fatty acids. But ﻿once the grain is refined to make it easier to use in cookies, cakes and breads, it leaves only the endosperm, which is nutrient-poor starch. Read the label and look for the word ﻿“whole﻿” before the grain listed. In addition, stay away from: Commercially baked cookies and cakes, which are often high in fructose, a type of sugar that can reduce feelings of fullness and increase your desire to eat. Fried foods and potato chips, including commercial french fries, which may taste good but won’t fill you up for long. Candy bars — well, you knew that. How to add weight-loss foods to your diet Keep fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods you enjoy on hand for easy snacks and meals, says Hawkins. To avoid spoilage, consider stocking up on frozen fruits and vegetables. Canned fruits and vegetables are another good shelf-stable option, as long as they’re free of added sugar or salt. Tip: Rinsing canned foods before using them can help wash away excess sodium and preservatives. “I love a hearty salad that includes a green vegetable, a whole grain or starchy vegetable, beans, lentils, or nuts, and healthy fats,” Hawkins adds. “For example, a salad with finely chopped kale, roasted sweet potatoes, toasted walnuts, goat cheese, and a vinaigrette makes a delicious combination. For a complete meal, you could serve it with a salmon fillet.” Soups and stews are another great way to assemble a balanced meal—plus, they’re budget-friendly if you use leftovers. Think chili with lean ground beef or turkey, beans, and fresh or canned produce paired with a whole grain. How to find your ideal portion size For personalized guidance, consider asking your doctor or dietitian for nutrition counseling. Medicare even covers medical nutrition therapy for patients with diabetes or kidney disease. “Listening to your body’s hunger and fullness cues is helpful so that you’re eating when hungry and stopping when full,” says Hawkins. For general tips, Hawkins suggests using MyPlate.gov as a resource for understanding food groups and serving sizes tailored to different calorie needs. “Generally, I recommend making half your plate fruits and vegetables, a quarter lean protein, and a quarter starch to create a filling meal without going overboard on calories,” she adds.

Medications help with some symptoms, and new options may slow early stages of this form of dementia By Hallie Levine Updated April 29, 2025 Reviewed by Jason Karlawish, M.D. Comments En español Published January 17, 2024 / Updated April 29, 2025 Ildar Imashev / Getty Images In the modern medical world, when someone is diagnosed with a disease, the usual first step is to be prescribed a well-proven medicine (or two) as a remedy. ﻿For dementia and one of its most common cause﻿s, Alzheimer’s disease, therapies that stop the disease have been elusive. But the outlook may be changing, at least for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in its early stages. Recent Food and Drug Administration approvals of two medications that slow the disease in some patients bring tempered excitement, says James Leverenz, M.D., director of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health at the Cleveland Clinic. ﻿“Perhaps we are on the road to being able to modify the disease, slow progression.”﻿ Dementia describes cognitive decline that interfere﻿s with a person’s ability to perform daily tasks, such as managing money. Our lack of a full picture of the causes of dementia has made it frustratingly difficult to develop medicines that stop the disease, let alone reverse its progress. Drugs that have been around for decades ﻿“are designed for the treatment of symptoms, and their effects are modest,” Leverenz says. Among the various types of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease has been the focus of most of the drug development work. More than 7 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s disease. The past two years have been encouraging, as two drugs have shown effectiveness in clinical testing in people at the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, specifically mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. These stages are not to be confused with early onset Alzheimer’s, which occurs before age 65. The two recently approved drugs appear to slow the progression of disease, but each comes with drawbacks. As research moves new drug options to the forefront, studies also point to lifestyle changes, some of them intensive, that can help prolong everyday function and improve behavioral and psychological symptoms of the disease. Below is a look at the medications available and what’s on the horizon.﻿ FDA-approved medications to slow Alzheimer’s Two drugs have full FDA approval to treat people with early stage Alzheimer’s. Both drugs target one of the abnormal proteins that build up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, and ﻿both approvals came with caution. The drugs are named Leqembi (lecanemab) and Kisunla (donamemab). A third drug, Aduhelm (aducanumab), got conditional FDA approval in 2021 but was discontinued by its maker, Biogen, in early 2024. ﻿ Leqembi and Kisunla are monoclonal antibodies that help remove amyloid plaques that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. These plaques appear to damage parts of the brain that are important for memory, thinking, learning and behavior. Leqembi received full FDA approval in July 2023. ​​The drug is given as an IV infusion once every two weeks at a medical office. In a phase 3 study comparing the drug with placebos, Leqembi’s makers, Eisai and Biogen, showed that Leqembi reduced the level of amyloid plaques while slowing the rate of cognitive decline by 27 percent over 18 months in patients in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. “It doesn’t stop the disease, and it doesn’t make people get better, but it slows down the rate where people get worse,” says Ronald Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Kisunla, made by Lilly and approved by the FDA in July 2024, slowed the loss of thinking and memory skills in a phase 3 study comparing the drug with placebos in patients with early stage Alzheimer’s disease. This drug “seems to get rid of the amyloid at the core of the plaques,” Leverenz says. “There’s a feeling that this amyloid is what drives the development and progression of the disease early on.” In an 18-month study giving Kisunla infusions every four weeks compared with placebos, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 38 percent, researchers reported in July in JAMA. Once amyloid levels dropped below a certain level, the drug was stopped. There are important limitations on the use of Leqembi and Kisunla. The FDA says the drug﻿s are only for those with mild cognitive impairment or mild-stage dementia. A person with MCI functions independently but with some inefficiency in daily activities. A person with mild dementia may have memory loss and confusion and trouble handling finances, problems that interfere with independence. The drug﻿s have a risk﻿, called ARIA, which stands for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. ARIA usually shows as bleeding of the brain that may be accompanied by swelling. In the large Leqembi study, about 13 percent of patients experienced brain swelling. In the Kisunla study, 25 percent of patients taking the drug experienced brain swelling. Most of these side effects disappeared within four months. Because people with two copies of the APOE e4 gene variant, which raises risk ﻿for Alzheimer’s disease, are more likely to experience ARIA, patients considered for Leqembi or Kisunla should be tested for APOE e4. Patients taking blood thinners are also at greater risk of brain bleeds while taking these drugs. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits A review of 31 studies of 31 studies of drugs that clear amyloid plaques, published in March 2023 in the journal Neurology, pointed out some brain shrinkage with these drugs. But what shrinks away are the amyloid plaques, says Nick Fox, M.D., professor of neurology and director of the Dementia Research Centre at University College London. “The brain volume shrinkage is related to amyloid removal; amyloid plaques occupy a significant volume in the cortex of the brain in Alzheimer’s disease,” he wrote in an email. “Studies show these plaques can be extensively removed by the immunotherapies thereby leading to a reduction in brain volume.” His paper supporting this conclusion is scheduled for September publication in Lancet Neurology. What might future treatments look like? ​Amyloid-clearing drugs may need to be paired with other types of drugs designed to remove a protein called tau from the brain. In Alzheimer’s disease, tangles of abnormal tau form inside nerve cells, causing problems in communication between nerve cells. Several tau-removing drugs are being tested in people with Alzheimer’s, including Biogen’s BIIB080, which reduced tau levels by more than 5﻿﻿﻿﻿0 percent in a very early clinical trial of 46 patients with early disease. Researchers, including those supported by AARP and others through the Dementia Discovery Fund, are developing and testing several other approaches to treat Alzheimer's and other dementias. Drugs to ease behaviors and other symptoms Several medications are available to treat certain Alzheimer’s symptoms, and some are used for other forms of dementia as well. These treatments do not slow progression of disease. They include: Cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs prevent the breakdown of a brain chemical called acetylcholine that’s important for memory and thinking, says Gary Small, M.D., at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey. Three examples are Aricept (donepezil), Exelon (rivastigmine) and Razadyne (galantamine), all approved for Alzheimer’s. Exelon is also approved to treat dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease.Namenda (memantine). This drug inhibits the activity of a brain chemical called glutamate, which sends messages between nerve cells. In Alzheimer’s disease, nerve cells make too much glutamate, which causes damage and cell death. Namenda is approved for people with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. The drug can be used on its own or with a cholinesterase inhibitor, Small says.Belsomra (suvorexant). The drug inhibits a brain chemical called orexin, which can keep a person awake. Belsomra is approved to treat insomnia in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Doctors may prescribe the drugs below to help treat symptoms that may appear in later stages of the disease: Antidepressants such as Zoloft (sertraline) to improve mood and irritability, although studies have questioned their effectiveness.Antipsychotic medications such as Risperdal (risperidone) or Haldol (haloperidol) for hallucinations, delusions, aggression or agitation. These drugs may not be appropriate for people with Lewy body dementia or Parkinson’s disease dementia, Petersen cautions, as they may worsen behavioral symptoms. The first anti-agitation drug to receive FDA approval, which occurred in May 2023. Rexulti (brexpiprazole) is prescribed for Alzheimer’s-related agitation, from pacing and restlessness to verbal and physical aggression. The drug comes with a black box warning, the FDA’s strongest, of an increased risk for death in older people with dementia. Although there are medications to treat other forms of dementia, they are usually geared to a specific condition, Petersen says. The treatment for vascular dementia, for example, is often aimed at improving blood vessel health, which means getting control of risk factors such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and being overweight.

But this globe-like structure is a complex, finely tuned, pretty amazing mechanism, with an array of parts that work together to allow us to see. What are the basic anatomical parts of the eye? The sclera “The eye is a container,” says Richard Rosen, M.D., the surgeon director and retinal service chief at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, in New York City. The outside layer of the eye is a tough white protective layer called the sclera (more commonly known as the “white of the eye”). “Composed of collagen fibers, which give it a dense structure, the sclera provides some protection for the eyeball,” says Rosen. More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health The cornea Light reflects off the object we’re looking at and enters the eye through the cornea, a clear, thin, dome-shaped tissue at the very front of the eye. The cornea has a curvature to it and covers the eye, kind of like a crystal covering the face of a watch. “When rays of light enter the eye, they’re sort of parallel to each other,” says Rosen. “But as they pass through the cornea, they bend and start to converge.” From there, light travels through a clear fluid, called the aqueous humor, which fills small chambers behind the cornea, nourishes the eye and helps retain pressure to help the eye retain its shape. The pupil and iris As the light continues, it passes through an opening called the pupil, that black dot at the center of the eye. The pupil is surrounded by the iris, the colored part of the eye. It’s the iris’s job to control how much light the pupil lets into the eye. When there is bright light, the iris uses muscles to change the size of the pupil, making it narrow to let in less light (constriction) or wider to let in more light (dilation). AARP/Shutterstock The lens Next, the light penetrates the lens, a transparent structure that works with the cornea to bend light and focus it onto the retina, which is located in the back of the eye. “The lens accumulates proteins as we age, causing a cloudy lens, or cataracts,” says Jaclyn Haugsdal, M.D., clinical assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine. Small elastic muscles, known as ciliary muscles, which are attached to the lens, help it change its shape in order to focus at various distances. When these muscles contract, the curvature of the lens increases, allowing us to see objects that are close up. When these muscles relax, the lens becomes flattened, helping with long-range vision. The vitreous humor The large space behind the lens, in the back portion of the eye and in front of the retina, is filled with a clear, gel-like substance, called the vitreous humor, that attaches to the retina at several points. The gel helps keep the space in the middle of the eye clear so light can reach the retina. “It also provides some elasticity to the eye, helping it keep its shape,” says Rosen. “For example, rubbing your eyes causes your eye pressure to spike, but it returns to normal when you stop rubbing. Or, if you poke your eye, it doesn’t automatically deflate because this kind of elastic material fills the eye and absorbs the impact, preventing it from causing much damage.” The retina From there, the light hits the retina, a thin, light-sensitive layer of tissue lining in the back wall of the eye. (Interesting tidbit: The curvature of the lens and bending of light actually creates an upside-down image on the retina. The brain eventually turns the image right side up.) Embedded in the retina are millions of light-sensitive cells, called photoreceptors. There are two types: cones and rods. Cones are responsible for producing the visual sharpness of the eye — seeing road signs when driving, fine print when reading or recognizing facial details like the color of someone’s eyes — as well as color vision. “Most of these cones are concentrated in a very specific area in the center of retina, called the macula,” says Haugsdal. The rods are located mostly in the outer edges of the retina. They are more sensitive to lower light levels and help us with night vision, allowing us to see in a dimly lit room, for example. “The marvelous thing about our eyes is that they have incredible dynamic range that allow them to adjust to a huge differential in terms of light,” says Rosen. “You can see in almost pitch darkness, but you can also see in bright sunlight. A camera doesn’t have that range. You reach levels of light where it’s either too dark or too light to get a good picture.” These cells work together in the retina to detect and absorb the light rays, then convert it into electrical signals, which are then sent to the visual cortex in the back of the brain, via the optic nerve in the back of the eye. The brain interprets these impulses, turning the signals into the images that we see. The brain Almost half of our brain capacity is devoted to processing visual information, according to researchers at MIT. In fact, when it comes to vision, our brain — and its ability to process those points of light — is every bit as important as the baby browns, blues and greens that we’re peering through. Ultimately, “it’s where the information is assembled,” Rosen says. “We see with our brain.” AARP/Shutterstock Barbara Stepko was a longtime health and lifestyle writer, and former editor at Women’s Health and InStyle.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/flu-symptoms/,"Your Guide to the 2023-2024 Flu Season View Series How to Spot Serious Flu Symptoms​ Some can be atypical in older adults. Spotting them can be key to getting an effective antiviral Rx By Kimberly Goad, Updated February 14, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published September 10, 2021 / Updated February 14, 2025 Getty Images Fever. Fatigue. Muscle aches. A cough. With several respiratory illnesses circulating, it can be hard to know what exactly these symptoms point to. One major clue that you could have the flu: They came on abruptly (while those associated with COVID-19, for example, tend to start out mild and gradually worsen). ﻿ But that’s not to say the flu always announces itself in the regular way — particularly among people over 65. In a study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, older patients were less likely than younger ones to report fever, cough and sore throat — arguably the most common flu symptoms — and as a result, weren’t diagnosed as quickly, if at all. That can be problematic if you’re 65 and older, since age alone ups your chances of getting hit much harder by a bout with the flu.﻿ Blame your immune system, which weakens with age, “so all infections are more severe, as are complications from infections,” says infectious disease specialist Purvi Parikh, M.D., a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “Those over 65 may also have other chronic medical problems like heart disease and diabetes that make it even harder to fight off infections."" That explains why 70 to 85 percent of seasonal-flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 and older; and 50 to 70 percent of seasonal-flu-related hospitalizations have happened among older adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ﻿ “There’s always been clear knowledge that people over 65 are at an increased risk of severe complications from influenza, and hospitalization or death,” says Paul Auwaerter, M.D., clinical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases and professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ﻿ That’s why it’s important to get up to speed on flu symptoms and see your doctor if you have any or all of the following, especially if you have a medical condition such as heart disease or diabetes. 1. Fever All kinds of things can make your body temperature venture north or south of the well-known benchmark of 98.6 F. For instance, it can go up when you exercise and down when you sleep. But a fever of 100.4 F or more is “a sign your body is responding to something dangerous physically and is trying to mount an immune response,” says Auwaerter. ﻿ But a fever doesn’t have to get that high to cause complications in people over 65, he adds. Why? “People who are older may have less buffer in terms of handling fever and the infection may worsen more rapidly than it might in a younger person,” he says. “Any fever in an elderly person is a red flag,” Auwaerter stresses, adding that you should call your doctor if you have a temperature over 100 F. If you’re under 65 and do not have any other risk factors, you might have uncomplicated influenza, he says, which could respond well to over-the-counter therapies and supportive care. Keep in mind: Just because you aren’t running a temperature doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. You can have the flu without having a fever. 2. Trouble breathing You’re short of breath and all you’ve done is walk to the mailbox and back. Or maybe you’re having trouble completing a sentence without stopping to catch your breath. A family member may even have noticed you’re breathing faster than normal. If you have the flu, all of these can be a red flag that your condition has become serious. “When you’re not getting enough oxygen, the body sends out signals to breathe fast in an effort to increase oxygen levels and adrenaline levels to make the body respond to a relative state of not acquiring enough oxygen that’s demanded by the body,” explains Auwaerter. “If you’re feeling short of breath, if you’re turning blue, if you’re confused — all of these should prompt calling emergency medical services.” 3. Dehydration Staying hydrated is always important. If your body isn’t getting enough fluids, it can’t function as it should. And yet research suggests 17 to 28 percent of older adults in the U.S. are dehydrated for any number of reasons. Not only is it a frequent cause of hospitalization, it can also complicate various medical conditions. There are a number of ways the flu can make it difficult to stay hydrated. If you’re running a fever, vomiting or have diarrhea, it’s easy to become dehydrated, notes Auwaerter. “Breathing faster than normal also causes water losses.” That’s why getting plenty of fluids (water, broth, sports drinks) is critical to avoiding complications from the flu. Just don’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink. Although mild fluid loss can usually be treated at home, severe dehydration must be treated in the hospital, according to the CDC. Some signs you’re dehydrated: Besides extreme thirst, look for fatigue, dizziness, confusion, a fast-beating heart, dry eyes and dark-colored urine. “I tell people to drink enough so they’re going to the bathroom regularly and their urine is light-colored to clear,” says Auwaerter. If you have heart failure or kidney disease, check with your doctor about safe amounts of liquid. ﻿ And don’t forget: Alcohol and caffeinated drinks aren’t fluids you should be reaching for when you’ve got the flu. These act as a diuretic, just the opposite of what you should be consuming when you’re trying to stay hydrated. 4. Dizziness or confusion Getting Early Treatment With Antivirals When it comes to treating the flu, time is of the essence. You typically have two days from the onset of symptoms to start taking an antiviral drug — a type of prescription medicine that keeps the flu virus from replicating in your body. Antiviral treatment can be the difference between having a milder case of the flu versus a more serious bout. Some studies have reported that when used early enough, it can reduce the risk of death for adults hospitalized with the flu.﻿ “Anyone who thinks they have influenza should call their doctor, because early treatment is paramount to getting better, and there’s a limited window after onset of symptoms for antivirals to work,” says Auwaerter of Johns Hopkins. “Patients with risk factors or progressive symptoms of influenza have a longer period for which antiviral medicines may have some impact, even three to four days into their illness,” he adds. But sooner is better “to avoid severe illness or hospitalization.” Your doctor will take into account your overall health when prescribing one of the four antivirals recommended by the CDC to treat the flu: oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) One of the oldest antivirals on the market, this is taken as a pill or liquid suspension and is also available as an equally effective, and often cheaper, generic medicine. Clinical trials have proven that this drug works to relieve flu symptoms. zanamivir (Relenza) Taken through an inhaler device, this drug isn’t recommended for people with breathing problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. peramivir (Rapivab) Given intravenously, this antiviral is used for hospitalized patients. baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) One of the newest antivirals available, it can be taken as a single dose (as opposed to Tamiflu, which is taken over several days). Given its side effects, however, this medication is not recommended for people with other illnesses, or those whose immune systems are severely compromised. When you have the flu or another infection like COVID-19, a sudden and significant change in health status should be considered a red flag. ﻿You should contact your doctor right away or go to the emergency room if they occur during a bout with respiratory illness, says Waleed Javaid, M.D., director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown and professor of medicine, infectious diseases, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “Persistent dizziness or confusion could be a sign of severe illness, dehydration or lack of oxygen,” he notes.

Declining trends, however, shouldn’t be mistaken for lax precautions. Doctors and virus experts say it’s just about time for older adults to roll up their sleeves for another dose of the coronavirus vaccine. In October 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a recommendation that people ages 65 and older get a spring shot of the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine to boost their immune systems and restore protection that has waned since the fall, when the updated vaccines became available. Immunocompromised individuals — those who have cancer or take certain medications to treat an autoimmune disorder, for example — are also advised to get another COVID vaccine. “Those two groups are the ones that are now consistently making up the population that’s suffering from severe COVID-19, meaning emergency room visits or hospitalizations,” says Andrew Pekosz, a professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. In early January, the COVID hospitalization rate for adults younger than 50 was 1.0 per 100,000 people; for those 65-plus, it was 18.3 per 100,000. And during last year’s respiratory illness season, adults 65 and older accounted for 70 percent of all COVID-related hospitalizations. Why do older adults need a boost? A big reason has to do with age-related changes that make it more difficult for older adults to fight off an infection, explains Rachel M. Presti, M.D., a professor of medicine and medical director of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Unit at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. This is not unique to COVID-19. Older adults are more susceptible to severe illness from other bugs, such as influenza, which is why a high-dose version of the flu shot is recommended for people 65-plus. Additionally, the COVID vaccines “provide really pretty good protection in the short term, but by the time you get to month four, five and six, that protection begins to wane,” William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told AARP. And, unlike flu, which typically strikes during the fall and winter, COVID-19 is active year-round, which is why it has surged in the summer months. “So this six-month boost is meant to sort of kick that [immunity] back up to high levels of protection until the following fall,” Pekosz says, when people are typically vaccinated for flu and COVID-19. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. When should you get the COVID-19 vaccine? The recommendation from the CDC is for people age 65-plus to get the COVID-19 vaccine six months after their last dose. So, if you were vaccinated in September or October, you’re just about due for another. If you waited on the vaccine in the fall and got it more recently, however, you can still get another dose this spring. While the CDC advises a six-month stretch between the two shots, the agency says the minimum time is two months apart, “which allows flexibility to get the second dose prior to typical COVID-19 surges, travel, life events and health care visits.” Three different COVID-19 vaccines are available at pharmacies and health clinics, including an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech and a protein-based vaccine from Novavax. Less than a quarter of U.S. adults (about 23 percent) received the latest COVID-19 vaccine as of Feb. 22, federal data shows; an estimated 25 percent of adults 65 and older had received the shot as of November 2024, according to Medicare data. How effective is the COVID vaccine? The strains of coronavirus currently circulating have drifted from the variant the vaccines target. “But there have been a number of studies that show that the vaccine still does induce what we call cross-reactive antibodies and that it will recognize the currently circulating variants,” Pekosz says. “So it looks like it’s still effective,” Presti adds. Getting the vaccine this spring doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t catch COVID-19, but it does reduce the risk that you’ll experience severe illness if you get infected. “Thousands of people died of COVID-19 [in the past year], and the vast majority of them either haven’t been vaccinated or haven’t been vaccinated recently. So there certainly still is data that says that the vaccine is a safe and effective way to minimize severe disease,” Pekosz says. The COVID-19 vaccine can also help prevent the spread of the illness, Presti points out. “And that’s part of why vaccines are so effective,” she says. “It’s not just to protect you; it’s really to protect everyone around you as well because then, even if you get infected, you won’t transmit as much to other people, because you won’t be producing as much virus because your immune system will be able to clear it.” Heading into spring, it’s “still useful” to think of other ways to lower your chances of getting COVID-19, Presti adds. Wash your hands often, she says, and consider keeping a mask handy in case you’re out in public and people around you are coughing or sneezing. “It’s still a very legitimate way to protect yourself, in addition to getting the vaccine,” she says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/health-and-weight-loss-70s/,"What Your Weight in Your 70s (and Beyond) Means for Your Health Here are some surprising truths about our changing bodies, and what those changes really mean to our health and longevity By Jessica Migala with Sari Harrar, Ginny Graves, Nicole Pajer and Beth Howard, AARP Comments En español Published May 17, 2023 ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHRISTINE RÖSCH When we were younger, staying lean was a common goal. But as we move into our 70s and beyond, we need to reassess the way we think about weight. Of course, obesity remains a major risk factor at any age, increasing our chances of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, joint problems and cancer. But how we think about our weight — and the steps we take to control it — needs to be a bit more nuanced. “Losing weight” isn’t always a smart goal. “Once you’re over 70, we worry about rapid weight loss, being underweight and sarcopenia [age-related muscle loss],” says Kristen DeCarlo, M.D., a geriatrician who practices in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at UI Health in Chicago. If you notice that you’re starting to drop pounds unintentionally, be aware that this downtrend may indicate muscle loss. Some research indicates that having a bit of extra weight on you as you age may, in fact, be protective. Doctors use the BMI (body mass index) scale as one measure of body fat to determine whether you’re underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese. (The easiest way to find your BMI: Go to aarp.org/bmi.) In a 2022 study, researchers found that the best BMI for health in those over 65 is 31 to 32 for women and 27 to 28 for men — higher than what’s recommended for people under 65. This is referred to as the obesity paradox, and exactly why it exists isn’t fully understood, says DeCarlo. Some studies show that people with higher BMIs in their 60s, 70s and older even had a lower dementia risk than people who were of normal weight or underweight, although why is a matter of debate. Since weight loss is a common characteristic of dementia, being thinner may simply be an indicator of the disease’s onset. That doesn’t mean ignoring your weight is OK. Quite the opposite: Paying attention to changes to your weight and body shape, as well as making a concerted effort to hold on to as much muscle as possible, can help you stay in a healthy range — so you can live well for years to come. 5 things happening to your body in your 70s It’s not just the scale that spins differently as we get older. Other changes to our physique are taking place, says Gitanjali Srivastava, M.D., medical director of Vanderbilt Obesity Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. 1. Muscle loss is accelerating. “As we get older, we may become frailer,” says Srivastava. “Not doing any weight training in your 50s or 60s leads to a lot of muscle mass loss that may be more noticeable now.” By the time you reach your eighth or ninth decade, half of your muscle mass may have vanished. Nearly one-third of adults over age 70 struggle with walking, getting out of a chair or climbing stairs, according to the National Institute on Aging. Resistance training, especially exercises aimed at the larger muscle groups in the body such as the butt and thighs, can help a great deal. Try air squats: Stand with your back to a sturdy chair, with your feet shoulder-width apart and your back straight. Now bend your knees and lower your butt as if to sit on the chair. But as soon as your butt touches the seat, immediately push up using your butt and thighs to return to a standing position. (Do one set of 35 repetitions, then eventually work up to four sets of 35.) Try to do this exercise three days per week; research shows that this regimen improves lower body function in older adults. 2. You may be losing weight but gaining fat “For reasonably healthy adults, there’s a natural increase in body fat until your 80s,” says DeCarlo. Muscle loss, plus hormonal changes and medication side effects, can contribute to you carrying around more fat than you did in your younger years. It’s generally believed that every pound lost is about 75 percent fat and 25 percent muscle, DeCarlo says. That’s why, rather than losing weight, “preventing weight gain should be the goal,” says cardiologist Carl J. Lavie, M.D., medical director of cardiac rehabilitation and prevention at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans. “There are some risks with losing weight, especially in elderly people, in their upper 70s and 80s. You want to keep good muscle strength as you get older. Physical activity and fitness are even more important than weight now.” “We see a lot of octogenarians who have obesity, are struggling to lose weight, but are also very frail and have multiple medical problems,” says Srivastava. Having more muscle mass — even if your weight puts you in the obese category — is protective; your doctor can assess you for sarcopenia and then make a recommendation from there. 3. Weight loss can happen unexpectedly Up to one in five older adults loses weight unintentionally, which is defined as losing 5 percent of one’s body weight within six to 12 months without a known cause (such as dieting, exercise or a medication side effect). This loss may be due to depression, anxiety, medications or even some cancers. No matter what your starting weight, if your clothes are suddenly mysteriously baggy, flag it for your doctor. 4. Your metabolism is slowing Since your 60s, your metabolism — the rate your body burns calories — has been sputtering. Your body requires fewer calories to keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing; having less muscle — metabolically active tissue that burns more calories than fat — also contributes to a more sluggish engine. In fact, in your 90s, you may burn only 75 percent as many calories as your middle-aged self. 5. Your face and your butt have become thinner Over the past few decades, some of the fat beneath your skin (subcutaneous fat) relocated to your abdomen, where it became visceral fat, says Srivastava. Visceral fat is the type that lives deep within your belly and hugs your stomach, liver and intestines. As a result, your butt, legs and arms may appear thinner and your face less full. “Patients talk about their skin feeling like paper; they report barely bumping themselves and getting a scrape,” says DeCarlo. Some of this, she explains, is a decrease in collagen and elastin, your skin’s support structures. Your weight and your risk of chronic disease Three out of four people in their 70s and even more in their 80s have some degree of cardiovascular disease, and older adults account for 80 percent of heart disease deaths. For many, it’s the result of years of high cholesterol, high blood pressure and/or high blood sugar. For others, it’s new damage, as aging stiffens arteries and heart valves, boosts blood pressure, and weakens your ticker’s ability to pump strong and keep a steady beat. A lifetime of carrying extra weight also takes a toll. “Excess body weight puts a strain on your heart that increases the risk for heart failure and atrial fibrillation [offbeat heart rhythms that boost stroke risk],” Lavie says. That said, where you carry the weight may matter more than how much you carry. While some fat under the skin may be protective, visceral fat can be toxic. “Visceral fat releases fatty molecules into the blood. And it’s invaded with immune cells called macrophages that create low levels of chronic inflammation in the body,” explains Jean-Pierre Després, a professor at Université Laval in Quebec City, Quebec, and a leading body fat and health researcher. Visceral fat can wrap around your heart and kidneys and infiltrate your liver, boosting risk for diabetes by interfering with your body’s ability to absorb blood sugar, says cardiologist Ian J. Neeland, M.D., codirector of the Center for Integrated and Novel Approaches in Vascular-Metabolic Disease at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. “It’s a big driver for cardiovascular disease.” Meanwhile, our immune system becomes more sluggish as we age, a problem compounded by excess fat. “Obesity is the silent killer of the immune system,” says David Bartlett, adjunct assistant professor of medicine at Duke University. Our immune system gradually declines from our 40s into our 70s, and then begins a precipitous drop in our 80s, leading to a decline in the production of effective antibodies that can neutralize viruses, says Laura Haynes, a professor of immunology at the UConn Center on Aging in Farmington, Connecticut. “The other thing that happens with age is an increase in systemic inflammation, which may be driven by increased body fat. The more fat you have, the more inflammation.” Inflammation disrupts the immune system as well as your hormonal system. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity is linked to at least 13 types of cancer. A combination of aerobic and strength training is the answer, says Bartlett. “A fair amount of observational data shows that if you’re physically active, you can improve your immune system, even if you start later in life,” he says. “Exercise moves cells around the body and into the blood, including dysfunctional T cells, which end up being cleared out of the body. In older athletes, we see a T cell profile similar to someone who is much younger.” How we think about weight As we reach age 70-plus, many of us are finding freedom at last from old body-shame stigmas. Surveys by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researchers found that women in their 70s were the least dissatisfied with their bodies and the least likely to say they thought about their weight every day — or several times a day. That said, disordered eating remains an issue for older people, says psychologist and body image researcher Lisa Kilpela, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Binge eating was a problem for up to 26 percent of women ages 60 to 83 in a recent study by Kilpela and others. “For the longest time, people didn’t think older women had eating disorders,” Kilpela says. “Older women who come to our lab say things like, ‘Thank you for thinking of us. We thought we’d be the forgotten ones because of our age.’ ” While there’s little research on body image in men over age 70, all of the participants in one University of British Columbia study of 28 men ages 65 to 83 said they felt grateful for what their bodies could do. Yet at the same time, most had frustrations about age-related changes, including muscle loss and extra pounds. At any age, though, your mental health can suffer if you struggle with body dissatisfaction. Paired with weight stigma, body dissatisfaction is associated with a higher risk for depression. In a 2021 study of 181 women ages 50 to 86, Kilpela also found that women with a negative body image got poorer sleep and had less social support. A negative body image is also associated with eating a less-healthy diet and getting less physical activity, says psychiatrist Debra Safer, M.D., the codirector of the Stanford Adult Eating and Weight Disorders Program at Stanford University in California. Regardless of how you look, or how you feel about how you look, discussing your weight with a health care provider is a smart idea. Our diet culture caters to young people; too few of us know about the positives, and negatives, of weight loss and weight gain after age 70, and what it all means for your unique shape. CHRISTINE RÖSCH 4 Healthy Weight Steps to Take Today Maintaining a healthy weight as we age — not too heavy, not too lean — is crucial to maintaining our independence. Here are some simple strategies that will keep you in shape while making sure you get the nutrition you need. 1. Start your day with protein Studies show that “protein timing” — eating 25 to 30 grams of protein in the morning and the same amount at lunch and dinner — helps people at midlife and beyond maintain muscle mass, which in turn reduces fat gain. 2. Choose farm foods over factory foods That means fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, seafood, olive and avocado oils, low-fat dairy and lean meat throughout the day. The fewer processed foods, the better. Foods in their natural form are the basis of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which are consistently rated as the best programs for weight management, heart health and longevity. 3. Move at least 30 minutes a day Daily active living beats having a few weekly gym sessions and sitting around the rest of the time. Aim for a total of at least 150 minutes of movement per week — walking swimming, biking, gardening — for cardiovascular fitness, and at least two days a week of resistance training for muscular strength. 4. Cut down on simple carbs, especially sugar Simple carbs like cookies and chips not only fill you up with calories while providing minimal nutrition, but a higher carbohydrate intake leads to water retention, making you look, feel and weigh heavier.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/what-are-polyphenols/,"The Superpowers of Polyphenols 11 foods and drinks high in these plant-based compounds that help protect the body and reduce disease By Lauren David, AARP Comments En español Published February 14, 2025 Photo Collage: AARP; (Source: Getty Images (6)) You’ve heard of antioxidants— compounds that protect the body from unstable molecules. But there’s another key nutrient found in many plant-based foods that functions like antioxidants and is getting a lot of attention. Researchers are taking notice and studying how they can help in the fight against chronic diseases and keep the body healthy. Say hello to polyphenols. ""There’s specific research that consumption of [polyphenols] can improve life quality, life expectancy, health in the prevention of cognitive aging and specifically Alzheimer’s disease,"" says Samantha Dieras, a registered dietician and director of ambulatory nutrition service at Mount Sinai Hospital. What are polyphenols? 11 Foods and Drinks High in Polyphenols Blueberries 525 mg/100g Blackberries 248 mg/100 g Raspberries 225mg/100 Strawberries 225 mg/100g Cranberries 120-315 mg/100g Coffee 200mg/ 100ml Green Tea 115mg/100ml Hazelnuts 291- 875 mg/100 g Pecans 1520 mg/100g Walnuts 1558-1625 mg/100g Olive oil 50-1000 mg/kg* *Based on olive ripeness, extraction technique and storage Polyphenols are molecules with both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that are found in plants and plant-based foods. ""The plant foods make polyphenols to protect themselves from the environment,"" says Beth Goodridge, a registered dietitian with Kaiser Permanente in northern California. ""When we eat plants that have polyphenols, it provides us with some protection, too."" You may have heard of some polyphenols, such as flavonoids and resveratrol, but there are more than 8,000 of these small molecules grouped into categories based on their chemical structures. Why are polyphenols good for you? ""The primary superpower [of polyphenols] is they act as an antioxidant in the body,"" says Goodridge. Antioxidants are natural compounds that neutralize unstable molecules or free radicals and protect the body. ""Free radicals disrupt the natural flow, "" says Goodridge. ""They cause mischief in the body,"" An accumulation of free radicals in the body damages cells, known as oxidative stress. Antioxidants help slow down the oxidative process and slow down aging. Helps older adults Polyphenols have many health benefits, especially for older adults. A 2022 review of health benefits of polyphenols in spices, published in Current Research in Food Science, notes that oxidative stress —an imbalance of antioxidants and free radicals in the body — is a major cause of many chronic diseases and aging cells. The authors said that polyphenols can help minimize cell damage due to oxidative stress. 11 Foods and Drinks High in Polyphenols Blueberries 525 mg/100g Blackberries 248 mg/100 g Raspberries 225mg/100 Strawberries 225 mg/100g Cranberries 120-315 mg/100g Coffee 200mg/ 100ml Green Tea 115mg/100ml Hazelnuts 291- 875 mg/100 g Pecans 1520 mg/100g Walnuts 1558-1625 mg/100g Olive oil 50-1000 mg/kg* *Based on olive ripeness, extraction technique and storage Provides health benefits Polyphenols can help with brain function and cognition. A systematic review published in Frontiers in Nutrition found that eating polyphenols for moderate and long periods may improve both working and episodic memory in middle-aged and older adults. One review published in the journal Antioxidants in 2022 hypothesized that polyphenols such as curcumin might help protect the brain by preventing the accumulation of the beta-amyloid plaques that are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Improves gut health Many foods that contain polyphenols also have fiber, which is important for regular bowel movements. ""Polyphenols can help with digestion, and that can help us in the restroom,"" says Goodridge. According to a study published in the Journal of Food Biochemistry in 2022, the gut microbiome transformed polyphenols into bioactive compounds that could have ""therapeutic effects"" on gut health. Helps with heart disease Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with one person dying every 33 seconds. ""One of the challenging things with heart disease is the inside of our arteries over the years can get rigid [and] stiff,"" says Goodridge. Arteries need to be elastic, yet oxidative stress can cause them to become rigid. ""Polyphenols can be protective of heart health,"" Goodridge says. Prevents negative effects of cell death Polyphenols can reduce cellular senescence. Cellular senescence occurs when cells die and accumulate in the body instead of leaving. They can leak harmful compounds, lead to inflammation and contribute to other coronary diseases, says Dieras. ""The number of cells that are in that stage accumulates as you get older,"" she says. Polyphenol-rich foods Many fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs, spices and beverages, such as green tea and coffee, contain polyphenols. The quantities of polyphenols vary based on the food or beverage, freshness, processing, and even the variety. Eating a healthy and varied diet helps ensure you're eating sufficient polyphenols. ""You're probably getting these within your diet if you're eating a diverse diet with fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds,"" says Dieras. There are also polyphenols in olive oil, whole grains and legumes. Plus, you get the additional benefits of fiber and vitamins when you eat these foods, she says. Brightly-colored fruits and vegetables, especially red-colored, are high in polyphenols, says Goodridge. Foods high in polyphenols include cranberries, pomegranates, red grapes, and berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and vegetables, like tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and onions, she says. (See box.) Eat a rainbow of colors for adequate nutrition throughout the week, says Goodridge. ""All the different colors help the body in different ways,"" she says. ""Color is mother nature's way of saying, 'I'm really good for you, whether that's a different polyphenol or a vitamin.'"" Why freshness matters Fresh produce has a higher nutrient content than fruits and vegetables that have been sitting in the fruit bowl or crisper drawer for a while. The longer it takes to consume fruit or vegetables after harvest, there's a steady decline in the bioavailability of the nutrients, says Dieras. ""A lot of the nutrients, including the polyphenols, can oxidize and degrade over time,"" she adds. Have a lot of produce that you aren't going to eat quickly? Keep produce cool. ""Polyphenols are delicate,"" says Goodridge. Store produce in the fridge to preserve some of the polyphenols, she says. Fresh produce has higher polyphenols than canned produce. ""There's going to be a higher polyphenol content in foods that are fresh versus cans,"" says Goodridge. ""Freshness definitely matters."" How much do you need? There are guidelines for how quantities of macronutrients, such as protein, you should be consuming daily. So, you may wonder if polyphenols have similar recommendations. ""There is no guideline yet for the amount of polyphenols that adults should eat every day,"" Goodridge says. In lieu of such recommendations, track the number of servings of fruits, vegetables and whole grains you eat in a day. ""For example, you want to have at least a cup and a half of fruit a day and at least two and a half cups of vegetables or more,"" says Goodridge. Half of your consumption of grains, at minimum, should be whole grains, such as brown rice or wheat bread for your daily amount, she says. By doing this, you'll be including an adequate amount. of healthy polyphenols in your diet. Should you take supplements? People may reach for a supplement when they're concerned that they're not getting an adequate intake of a vitamin, mineral or, in this case, polyphenols. Nutritionists recommend the best way to get polyphenols is with food. When you eat foods with polyphenols, you're also getting important macronutrients, such as fiber and micronutrients, like vitamin C, says Goodridge. The body absorbs polyphenols better in food than when they are isolated in a supplement. ""The other components in a food help those polyphenols to be digested and absorbed appropriately,"" says Goodridge. ""You don’t get that when it’s just a supplement."" Be aware that medications can interact with polyphenol supplements. ""A significant part of the population above 50 is on multiple medications,"" says Dieras. ""I don't know specifically how the individual polyphenols will interact with their medications."" Before you seek out supplements, you should always speak to your medical provider about any risks or adverse effects that could occur. ""It's important to speak to your provider to figure out all the medications that you're on, how they interact with each other, and how [a polyphenol] supplement would interact with those,"" says Dieras.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eyedrops-for-vision-loss/,"Can Eye Drops Replace Your Reading Glasses? Medication now available to treat age-related vision loss By Beth Levine, AARP Comments En español Published December 17, 2021 Shutterstock / megaflopp Toni Wright, 54, a beauty industry professional from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was forever squinting at her computer screen and cellphone. In restaurants, especially those with low lights, she was the one holding the menu as far away as her arm could reach. Diagnosed with presbyopia﻿ — age-related blurred near vision﻿ — when she was 50, Wright says, “I needed to have reading glasses with me at all times and almost panicked if I didn’t.” Presbyopia is estimated to affect 2 billion people globally, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). But there is good news for all the squinters among us: In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first (and so far, only) eye drops that treat presbyopia. ﻿The eye drops, called Vuity﻿, contain pilocarpine, which has been used for around 120 years to treat glaucoma. This is the first formulation to target presbyopia specifically. Allergan, a subsidiary of AbbVie, rolled out Vuity on Dec﻿. 9. Available by prescription only, Vuity works very simply﻿. Itslightly reduc﻿es pupil size by constricting certain muscles, explains AbbVie advisory board consultant Marguerite McDonald, M.D., ﻿a clinical professor of ophthalmology at both New York University and Tulane University. The constriction allows for improved up﻿-close vision. Approved for use once daily, it works for up to six hours. It costs about $86 for a 2.5 ﻿milliliter bottle﻿ (about a 30-day supply), depending on the pharmacy you visit. ﻿ Wright, who participated in the clinical trial for Vuity, would put the drops in her eyes in the morning, and she found that the effect kicked in by the time she got to work. McDonald says, on average, it should start working within 15 minutes. “I could see on my computer without struggling or needing glasses, and it lasted throughout the workday,” Wright reports. She says she felt no negative side effects. ​Vuity reports that users may experience temporary problems when changing focus between near and far objects.​ In its development of the drops, the company found that participants achieved a “three-line gain or more reading a near﻿-vision eye chart without losing more than one line in a distance vision eye chart at Day 30, three hours after dosing.” ​ “We know a great deal about the active compound pilocarpine. It was used in higher concentrations and it's very safe,” McDonald﻿ says. She adds that the drops can be used with contact lenses, but as with all eye medications, users should wait 15 minutes after application before inserting lenses. If using other eye drops, wait five minutes between different applications. Steven Plotycia, M.D., an ophthalmologist affiliated with Mount Sinai Medical Center﻿ in New York, warns that the drops may not work for everyone with presbyopia. “The ideal patient for these drops are people in their 40s to 50s who don’t want to wear reading glasses. The age group is old enough to have developed presbyopia but young enough that they would not have started developing cataracts,” he explains. Cataracts are lenses that have started to yellow, restricting the amount of light that gets in, making vision appear darker. Since Vuity acts by constricting the iris, limiting the amount of light that hits the lens, cataract patients will find that the drops make their vision appear even darker. They would have a lot of trouble driving at night or in other situations where light is low. “The significance of this FDA approval is massive. Glasses, contact lenses, and surgery are traditional treatments, but, for various reasons, do not work well for every patient. Having a novel treatment option in the form of a presbyopia eye drop is a welcome addition to our armamentarium against this universal age-related near vision condition that effects essentially everyone over the age of 40,” says Christopher Starr, M.D., clinical spokesperson for the AAO. Nine similar eye drops for presbyopia are in development and may be available in the future. Beth Levine is a health writer whose work has appeared in O: The Oprah Magazine, Woman's Day, Good Housekeeping, ﻿Reader's Digest and many more."
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/covid-flu-or-cold-symptoms/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by Is It a Cold? The Flu? COVID? Or RSV? Many symptoms overlap, but a few warning signs set the common illnesses apart By Rachel Nania, Updated January 15, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published September 27, 2022 / Updated January 15, 2025 Getty Images If it feels like everyone around you is battling a sore throat, the sniffles, and that achy, crummy feeling, you’re not wrong. According to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), common respiratory viruses are out in full force this winter. Throughout the country, COVID-19 activity is increasing, flu levels are elevated and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) is “very high,” health officials say. Still, the levels of illness we’re seeing now aren’t unusual for a typical winter season, says Stefan Gravenstein, M.D., a professor of geriatric medicine and director in the Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Care at Brown University. And colder temperatures and recent holiday gatherings are likely fueling the spread. If you catch one of these bugs, or even the common cold, it can be hard to tell what you’ve come down with, since they all share a similar list of symptoms. But knowing what you have can be an important first step to accessing medications that can help keep a mild infection from turning severe. Here are a few tips from experts on how to distinguish among the different diseases and how to recover from each of them. Plus, they have some advice on what you can do to help avoid getting sick in the first place. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. COVID-19 has a few distinct symptoms The truth of the matter is that several symptoms for a cold, the flu, RSV and COVID-19 overlap. Chief among them are sore throat, runny nose, cough and headache. There are some more specific symptoms, though, that could signal your sickness is caused by COVID-19. Loss of taste or smell, for example, is a common warning sign of a coronavirus infection. “Especially if you don’t really have a runny or stuffy nose and you have this symptom, that probably is something that’s more specific for COVID,” says Albert Shaw, M.D., an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. “And it’s one we would see less so in someone with a common cold or someone with influenza.” Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Another symptom that’s more typical with COVID-19 than with the others is diarrhea, Shaw says. It may not be as prevalent as some of the other COVID symptoms, but people still get it with a coronavirus infection. Diarrhea is not a common sign of the flu in adults (it is in kids, though), nor does it usually accompany a cold or RSV. “That said, there are other viral and bacterial illnesses that can give you diarrhea, so that alone doesn’t mean it can only be COVID. But if you’re trying to differentiate, I would say that those elements, if they’re present, might be of help,” Shaw says. Disorientation could point to COVID-19, especially in older adults, says Kenneth Koncilja, M.D., a geriatrician at the Cleveland Clinic. “I’ve seen more of my older patients present with symptoms of confusion [and test positive for COVID-19], where you might think it’s a urinary tract infection,” he says. And wheezing is more often a symptom associated with RSV, Gravenstein says, though people with flu and COVID can wheeze too, he notes. Sneezing a lot? That’s typically a symptom that’s more common with a cold or RSV than with the flu or COVID. And chances are, if you have a cold, you won’t experience the body aches and fever that accompany an influenza or coronavirus infection. (RSV can cause a low-grade fever, though.) Video: How to Prepare Your Immune System for the Winter Keep a COVID test — or two — on hand It’s still important to keep an at-home COVID test (or two) on hand — especially during fall and winter. That way, if you start to feel sick, you can check to see if your symptoms are due to COVID-19 in a matter of minutes. Don’t have any tests? The federal government reopened its program, and each U.S. household can order four free tests. There are also at-home tests available at pharmacies and some major retailers that can check for flu and COVID at the same time, with one swab of the nose. If you’re positive for COVID-19, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral pill, like Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) or Lagevrio (molnupiravir), which can significantly lessen your chances of severe illness. For flu, there are also antiviral medications that can treat an infection. In both instances, it’s important to start these treatments early in the disease course, so talk to your doctor right away if you find out you have COVID-19 or flu, or suspect you do and want to get tested by your provider. Video: How to Prepare Your Immune System for the Winter Prescription medications usually aren’t prescribed for RSV, although some bad cases may require hospitalization. That could change soon, however, since “there are a variety of treatments for RSV that are in clinical trials,” Gravenstein says. For now, RSV care often calls for fluids, rest and symptom management with over-the-counter medications, according to the CDC. The same goes for a cold. It’s not too late to get your vaccines One way to lower your likelihood of getting the flu, COVID-19 and RSV in the first place is to get vaccinated against each disease. And the good news is: If you skipped these shots in the fall, it’s not too late to get them. “In general, we say that any time during the respiratory season is a good time to get a vaccine if you haven't gotten it,” Gravenstein says. Not everyone who gets vaccinated will be able to completely avoid an infection, but the separate shots can blunt the severity of symptoms and help to keep you out of the hospital.“The vaccines are a lot like seat belts,” Gravenstein explains. “Wearing a seat belt doesn't keep you from getting in a car accident; you just don't get hurt as badly.” When it comes to COVID-19, health experts recommend that everyone 6 months and older get the recently updated coronavirus vaccine; adults 65 and older should plan on getting a second shot in the spring. Even with new coronavirus variants in the mix, health experts say the vaccines still help protect you from severe illness if you catch COVID. For the flu, adults 65 and older should ask for a high-dose vaccine, CDC recommendations say. There are three options to choose from, but experts say the differences among them are minimal. For most people, the best one to get is the one your doctor or pharmacist has available. There’s no need to space out your flu and COVID-19 shots, so if it’s more convenient to get them at the same visit, the CDC says that can be done. There’s also an RSV vaccine available, and it’s recommended for all adults 75 and older and for those ages 60 to 74 with certain risk factors, such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. While there is no vaccine to help prevent a cold, there are several steps you can do to avoid one: Wash your hands often, stay away from people who are sick, and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. These measures can also help you avoid many other illnesses swirling about this cold-weather season.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/photophobia/,"Could You Have Photophobia, a Light Sensitivity Condition? A look at the symptoms, causes, and treatments for discomfort caused by brightness By Barbara Stepko and Jessica Migala, Updated December 18, 2024 AARP Medically reviewed by Stan Sack, M.D. Comments Published February 20, 2020 / Updated December 18, 2024 Getty Images Have you ever awakened in the middle of the night, stumbled to the bathroom, hit the switch and … yikes!? Your initial response to that burst of light was probably to squeeze your eyelids shut or squint until your eyes adjusted to your surroundings. All of us have experienced light sensitivity at some time or other, but some people are extremely intolerant of bright light. This condition, known as photophobia, occurs “when normal light causes discomfort or pain in people, to the point where they want to avoid it,” says Kathleen Digre, M.D., a professor of ophthalmology and neurology at the John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, in Salt Lake City. The source of discomfort might be a sunny day, a lighted computer screen, bright fluorescent lighting in a store, or oncoming headlights at night. Some people may even become disabled, says Stephen Silberstein, Professor of Neurology and Director of the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals. “I have seen patients who literally cannot leave their house without dark sunglasses because of an increased sensitivity to light."" That said, photophobia itself is not classified as a disability. However, it can be a symptom of a disability, such as a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although photophobia literally means “fear of light,” having an abnormal sensitivity to light is not a mental health disorder. However, may be a symptom that accompanies common psychological conditions. Below, you’ll find more information on the symptoms of photophobia, its various causes, diagnosis, and the best ways to treat and manage light sensitivity. Causes and treatments of photophobia Photophobia isn't a condition but a symptom of other health conditions. Though the list of culprits is a long one, the main cause of photophobia is often related to neurological or vision problems. If you’re experiencing light sensitivity, the following are possible reasons why: Migraines One of the most common causes of photophobia is migraines. In fact, the majority of people who have migraine attacks experience heightened sensitivity to light. “Two-thirds of patients say photophobia is their most bothersome symptom during an attack,” Silberstein says. “But there are many who also have an increased sensitivity to light between attacks."" Blepharospasm Photophobia is also extremely common among those who have blepharospasm, involuntary eyelid muscle spasms originating in the motor nerves of the brain. In fact, a past survey found that a whopping 94 percent of patients with blepharospasm experience some level of light sensitivity that impacts their daily lives. What's more, light can actually trigger spasms. Other neurological conditions Pituitary tumors, meningitis and traumatic brain injury can cause light sensitivity. For example, about one in three people experience photophobia one week after a traumatic brain injury; for one in seven, photophobia sticks around for as long as three months. TBI may stimulate neural pathways underlying light sensitivity. Medications Some medications, such as antihistamines, benzodiazepines, furosemide (used to treat high blood pressure or fluid retention and swelling due to conditions such as congestive heart failure), methylphenidate (for ADHD), trifluridine (prescribed for viral eye infections) and certain antidepressants, have been linked to photophobia. If you have started on a new medication and are experiencing light sensitivity, connect with your prescriber who may consider adjusting your medications. Eye conditions A number of eye conditions are linked to photophobia: chronic dry eyes, cataracts, corneal abrasion, corneal neuropathy, optic neuritis (sometimes linked to multiple sclerosis), eye infections, uveitis (an inflammation of the eye), eye allergies and LASIK surgery. People who have light-colored eyes can be more prone to sensitivity, says Lama A. Al-Aswad, an ophthalmology professor at the Scheie Eye Institute at Penn Medicine in Radnor, PA, “because the iris doesn’t have as much pigment, which normally decreases the amount of light that goes into the eye.” Mental health issues There’s some indication that depression, anxiety, panic disorder, among other psychiatric conditions, may also have light-adverse tendencies. What’s more, these conditions may occur alongside others on this list, like migraine. For example, depression may be a driving factor behind light sensitivity that occurs between migraine attacks. What are the symptoms of photophobia? Signs that you may have photophobia include: Avoidance of light conditionsBlinking oftenEye discomfort or pain in the presence of lightFrequent squinting or blocking light with your handsHeadaches that are triggered by lightWearing sunglasses, even on overcast daysWorsening of pain in light Diagnosis of photophobia Your provider can identify photophobia by talking to you about your symptoms — but that’s not where it ends. While there are things you can do to manage light sensitivity, identifying the underlying cause is most important. Doctors will do that by: Reviewing your health history, including a discussion of when you first started noticing light sensitivity, what it feels like, how it affects your behavior, what medications you’re using and your eye care habits.Conducting a comprehensive eye exam to look at your eye health overall. This can identify conditions like cataracts, dry eye, optic neuritis, and more.Considering additional evaluations or testing to rule out issues like neurological disorders. Other vision-related conditions that involve light sensitivity, such as photo-oculodynia (eye pain from non-painful sources like ambient lighting) or hemeralopia (day blindness), may resemble photophobia but require different management. That’s why an accurate diagnosis is essential. Unfortunately, diagnosis isn’t always clear-cut. One-quarter of people who went to an eye care center for photophobia left without a diagnosis, according to a 2022 study. While eye care providers excel at diagnosing eye-related causes of photophobia, neurologists are better suited to identify neurological causes. Therefore, deciding who to see for a diagnosis can be challenging. Your primary care provider (PCP) is a good starting point for addressing photophobia. They can guide you to an appropriate specialist — such as an ophthalmologist, neurologist, or neuro ophthalmologist, the latter of who are particularly specialized in this area. However, neuro-ophthalmologists may be harder to find depending on your location. If you leave an eye care center without a diagnosis, consider consulting a neurologist. Photophobia treatments The first step in treating photophobia is figuring out what’s causing the symptom; then you can tackle the underlying condition. “Intermittent photophobia associated with migraine, for example, usually responds to medications such as triptans, nonsteroidals [NSAIDS],” Silberstein says. “Or we might try something to keep the attacks from occurring in the first place, like a beta-blocker or topiramate.” For those with dry eyes, your doctor might prescribe medicated eye drops or drugs that stimulate tear production. Lifestyle changes can also make light sensitivity easier to manage. Sunglasses with UV protection and polarized lenses can block bright sunlight or glares bouncing off reflective surfaces. However, “the biggest mistake that people make is wearing really dark sunglasses indoors or putting dark shades on their windows,” Digre says. “That only makes things worse because you become dark-adapted.” One strategy to minimize sensitivity is to gradually transition from darkness to light, giving the eyes an adjustment period, Silberstein says. Certain wavelengths of light can may also affect sensitivity. “Sunlight has all of them, but it’s the blue frequencies of light which seem to cause the most discomfort,” Silberstein says. A 2016 study, cited in the journal Brain, found that shades of green light seem to be the most soothing, particularly for those suffering from migraines. “I actually use it when examining patients with light sensitivity to make it more comfortable for them,” Digre says. You can buy specially tinted lenses to block that bothersome blue light. Digre recommends FL-41 tinted lenses, which have a special rose tint to filter out blue wavelengths and decrease light sensitivity. The lenses can be obtained without a prescription, but, Digre cautions, not all so-called FL-41 lenses are the real deal. “Some of these lenses have not been tested properly,” she says. “We did a study where we took a bunch of lenses that claimed to block blue light. Some did and some didn’t.” Al-Aswad suggests trying on lenses at an optical shop and wearing a trial pair for a few days to see if they improve your symptoms. If you buy lenses, be sure the store will allow returns if they don’t work. Migraine researchers from Harvard Medical School have come up with yet another way to combat photophobia: lamps designed specifically for those suffering from headaches triggered by light sensitivity. It emits a narrow band of green light which is believed to be gentler on the eyes than multicolored everyday light. Although the price tag may be steep, it may be worth the investment for those seeking relief.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test/,"What to Know About the First FDA-Cleared Blood Test for Alzheimer’s Disease Doctors say the test could help individuals who are experiencing symptoms get an earlier diagnosis By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published May 19, 2025 AARP (Getty Images 2) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has green-lit a blood test that can help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. It is the first blood test to be cleared by the FDA for the disease, which affects more than 7 million older Americans and is marked by a decline in memory and thinking skills. The test, called Lumipulse, can detect abnormal clumps of protein in the brain, known as amyloid plaques. These plaques disrupt brain cell function and are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. PET scans and spinal fluid tests can also detect amyloid plaques and have been used for years to help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s. But the tests are expensive and, in the case of the lumbar puncture, invasive. They can also be inaccessible for people in rural areas. Lumipulse, on the other hand, requires only a blood draw in patients 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of the disease. “Having a blood test just makes it so much easier in being able to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,” said Charles Bernick, M.D., a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, based in Las Vegas. In its news release, the test’s manufacturer, Fujirebio Diagnostics, didn’t specify the cost of the test. People without symptoms shouldn’t test The newly approved blood test measures two proteins in the liquid part of the blood, known as plasma, and then calculates the ratio of these proteins, which is “correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan,” the FDA said. The test is only meant for older adults who are experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease; it is not a screening test. What’s more, the FDA said, the results should be used along with “other clinical evaluations or additional tests” to determine treatment options. In addition to brain imaging and lumbar punctures, doctors often use neurological exams and cognitive tests, for example, to diagnose a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. “It still becomes a diagnosis where you have to really look at the whole picture,” Bernick said. In recent years, the FDA has approved two medications for the treatment of Alzheimer’s — Kisunla (donanemab) and Leqembi (lecanemab). These drugs, which are given by infusion, don’t cure the disease but can help to slow the rate of decline in people in its early stages. Because they work by clearing amyloid plaques from the brain, the presence of amyloid must be confirmed before they can be prescribed. “They carry some risk. So if you’re going to use them or utilize them, you’ve got to be pretty sure the person has that protein in the brain,” Bernick said. Risks can include swelling and bleeding in the brain. New test could ‘revolutionize’ research and clinical care Some Alzheimer’s specialists have already been using blood tests not cleared by the FDA to help with a diagnosis of the disease. The FDA’s approval is not required for laboratory-developed tests such as these blood tests. Having the agency’s sign-off, however, confirms a test’s accuracy and opens the door for insurance coverage and more widespread use. Expert groups applauded the FDA’s May 16 announcement. Howard Fillit, M.D., co-founder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said that there’s been a “tremendous need” for blood tests and that having one will “revolutionize clinical care and clinical research” for Alzheimer’s. “It’s going to reduce the cost of care and diagnosis, and it’s going to give people the opportunity to get a definitive diagnosis and enter into clinical trials,” Fillit told AARP. “Today marks another important step in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis,” Maria C. Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead at the Alzheimer’s Association, said in a statement. “For too long, Americans have struggled to get a simple and accurate diagnosis; with today’s action by the FDA we are hopeful it will be easier for more individuals to receive an accurate diagnosis earlier.” Fillit predicts that we’ll see more blood tests in the near future, including tests that detect other key features of Alzheimer’s disease, such as inflammation in the brain. Having such tests could help doctors tailor a patient’s treatment as more medications come online. “It’s kind of going to look like cancer, where patients have a tumor, there’s a biopsy of the tumor, the tumor cells are taken to the lab, they’re characterized according to various biomarkers, and then a treatment plan with various drugs in combination is designed for the patient, and the patient receives multiple drugs affecting multiple pathways in the cancer cell,"" Fillit said. ""We’re going to have that for Alzheimer’s disease in the future. So this is just the beginning of really going into a new age of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and care and clinical trials.” Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments."
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/stomach-ulcer-symptoms-causes-treatments/,"5 Warning Signs of Ulcers Symptoms to look for in this common ailment that can be dangerous if left untreated nazarkru / Getty Images By Michelle Crouch, AARP En español Published March 15, 2023 Did you know that the acid and enzymes in your stomach are so powerful that studies show they can dissolve metal items such as coins and razor blades? Imagine if those fluids started eating away at your organs. That’s what happens when you have a peptic ulcer, a painful sore that develops in the lining of your stomach or small intestine. As many as 1 in 10 people worldwide will have an ulcer, according to a 2022 study published in the journal PLoS One. Normally, a special mucus membrane keeps digestive fluids away from the surface of your stomach and intestine. Ulcers form when that barrier is damaged or overwhelmed, allowing acid to leak through. Doctors used to believe that emotional stress alone could cause ulcers, but they now know that’s not the case. Though stress is associated with an increased risk of ulcers, experts say most are caused by one of two triggers: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria: Thirty to 40 percent of people in the United States have this bacterium living in their stomach, often without any obvious symptoms. H. pylori can break down the protective lining in the stomach. Scientists don’t know exactly what percentage of stomach ulcers are linked to H. pylori, but the Cleveland Clinic estimates 40 percent. Overuse of certain pain medications: The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at high doses or over a prolonged period increases your risk of ulcers. The medications can irritate and thin your stomach lining and interfere with your body’s ability to repair damage to the area. Researchers estimate half of stomach ulcers are caused by NSAID overuse, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve), ketorolac (Toradol) and oxaprozin (Daypro). Ulcer causes often overlap, experts say. Being infected with the bacteria makes it much more likely that an NSAID will degrade your stomach lining. Older adults at higher risk Anyone can get an ulcer, but your risk increases with age, experts say. That’s partly because H. pylori infections are more common in older adults, says gastroenterologist Nimish Vakil, a professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Research shows that relative to other birth cohorts, people born in the 1940s and 1950s have a higher prevalence of H. pylori, according to a Japanese study. Older people are more likely to use NSAIDs, whether it’s daily low-dose aspirin for a heart condition or ibuprofen to relieve pain from arthritis, says ﻿Ekta Gupta, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine.﻿ Peptic ulcer symptoms Gupta says early ulcer symptoms can be subtle, “so it’s important to be mindful and aware of the signs.” If left untreated, ulcers can cause complications including a hole in the stomach lining, a blockage in your intestines, stomach cancer or life-threatening internal bleeding. Worried you might have an ulcer? Here are the symptoms to look for: 1. Burning pain in the upper abdomen The classic symptom of a peptic ulcer is gnawing or burning pain above the belly button. The pain is typically worse at night or on an empty stomach, but not always. “Often, patients report it gets better if they eat something,” Gupta says. The pain usually comes and goes for several days or weeks. Taking antacids may help temporarily, but the pain will keep coming back. 2. Bloating, fullness or loss of appetite When you have an ulcer, inflammation causes the lining of your stomach to thicken, leaving less room for food, says﻿ Tinka Barnes, a family medicine staff physician at Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a result, some patients say they feel like their stomach is distended or that they fill up quickly when they eat. “You’re not able to take in as much,” Barnes says. 3. Nausea and vomiting Although less common, ulcers can make you feel sick to your stomach, especially if you haven’t eaten in a while. 4. Fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin color Left untreated, peptic ulcers can start to bleed. The slow loss of blood can cause anemia, or iron deficiency. In some cases, anemia symptoms such as fatigue, pale skin and shortness of breath with exercise can be the first signs of a bleeding ulcer. 5. Bloody or dark stool, bloody vomit Sometimes, an ulcer causes severe bleeding, and that’s a medical emergency. Signs that an ulcer is bleeding heavily include: stool that looks jet black, that seems sticky or that has dark red blood mixed in; bloody vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds; and dizziness, fainting or light-headedness. If you experience any of those symptoms, you should call 911 or head for the nearest emergency room. Diagnosis and treatment If your medical provider suspects an ulcer, he or she may conduct tests to see if you are infected with H. pylori. In many cases, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. Treatment typically includes medications to block acid production such as proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers. If H. pylori is the culprit, you may also need to take a course of antibiotics. Most ulcers can be treated and will heal after several weeks. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/heart-health-foods/,"12 Superfoods for Heart Health Add these to your grocery list to lower blood pressure, fight inflammation and slash stroke risk By Alison Gwinn, Updated February 20, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published June 07, 2023 / Updated February 20, 2025 Getty Images ﻿When it comes to heart health, you probably know what the American Heart Association (AHA) offers as its top diet advice: Eat a good balance of fresh, fiber-rich fruits and veggies; whole grains; and healthy proteins, such as nuts, skinless fish and poultry. But recent studies have also named specific cardiovascular all-stars that are worth adding to your rotation. Here are a few standouts to add to your grocery list. 1. Beets﻿ Why: Beets deserve a badge of honor in the veggie family. That’s due to their high doses of nitrates, which help keep blood vessels dilated﻿ and lower blood pressure. Plus they are packed with heart-healthy antioxidants, says Kate Patton, outpatient dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. .A 2018 review of a decade’s worth of studies identified beet juice consumption as an effective way to control blood pressure in both healthy and hypertensive adults. Also know: When it comes to heart health, it pays to see red — or orange or yellow. ﻿ ﻿ “I tell patients to get a variety of different colored foods,” says Patton. Try these other blushing nutrient-rich veggies and fruits: carrots, sweet potatoes, acorn squash, oranges, cantaloupe and papaya. 2. Pumpkin seeds and walnuts Why: A study presented in 2019 at the AHA’s Hypertension Scientific Sessions found that eating pumpkin seeds may help lower blood pressure. According to the AHA, pumpkin seeds are rich in fiber and a variety of nutrients, particularly heart-healthy magnesium (a quarter cup contains 42 percent of the mineral’s RDA). As for walnuts, a 2022 research review found that consuming foods like walnuts that are rich in alpha-linolenic acid was linked to a 10 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease. And 2021 research published in the American Heart Association’s journal Circulation found that eating a half-cup of walnuts a day for two years modestly lowered the subjects’ LDL cholesterol. “Walnuts are good sources of monounsaturated fats,” Patton says. “For people who don’t eat fish, they are a good way to get in those omega-3 fats.” Also know: “Any nuts are good sources of monounsaturated fats,” says Kate Patton, lead outpatient dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic. “For people who don’t eat fish, they are a good way to get in those omega-3 fats.” A 2019 study presented at the European Society of Cardiology showed that eating nuts two or more times a week was associated with a 17 percent lower risk of death from heart disease. But remember one word: moderation. These are calorie-dense foods, so keep portions modest and avoid added salt, sugars and oils. Penny Kris-Etherton, Pugh university professor of nutritional sciences emeritus at Pennsylvania State University advises limiting yourself each day to “an amount that will fit in the palm of your hand.” 3. Tofu ﻿ Why: “This plant-based soy protein contributes isoflavones and is a substitute for animal proteins to help support flood lipid levels,” says Linda Van Horn, chief of the nutrition division in the department of preventive medicine at Northeastern University. Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital reported in 2020 that a study of more than 200,000 people found a link between consuming isoflavone-rich tofu more than once a week and an 18 percent lower risk of heart disease. Beyond that, tofu is a great source of plant protein, so it’s a smart substitute for red meat or pork. “It also has phytosterols — plant cholesterols that actually improve the cholesterol in our own bodies,” Brenes-Salazar says.﻿ Beyond that, tofu is a great source of phytosterols — plant cholesterols that can block the absorption of cholesterol, says Patton. Also know: A 2021 Chinese study found that eating soy four or more days of the week was associated with a significantly lower risk of death from heart attacks. The American Heart Association recommends one to two servings (or 5.5 ounces) f protein — from lean meat, chicken, eggs, fish, nuts or soy products — a day. Protein is especially important for aging bodies: “On average, most Americans consume enough protein, but older adults may have lower appetites and are at greater risk of muscle loss,” says Patton. 4. Olives and olive oils Why: If you’ve heard of the Mediterranean diet (and who hasn’t?), then you know all about olive oil. It not only boosts good, heart-protective cholesterol but also staves off diabetes and strokes. Recent research confirms its salubrious effects: A 2020 European study found that patients who had had heart attacks and subsequently followed a Mediterranean diet high in olive oil had better repair of the arterial linings; a 2022 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology﻿ found that consuming more than a half tablespoon of olive oil a day — or replacing about 10 grams a day of margarine, butter, mayonnaise or dairy fat with olive oil — is linked to a lower risk of death by heart disease. Try to follow the USDA guidelines of 27 grams (about two tablespoons) a day. “Remember,” Kris-Etherton says, “olive oil is calorically dense.” As for olives, make sure to buy the low-sodium variety, available at many big-box stores. ﻿ Also know: Other healthy oils for cooking: avocado, sunflower and canola oils, which have mostly healthy fats, says Patton. Getty Images 5. Garbanzo beans Why: First, they’re full of fiber, which can help lower your bad LDL cholesterol and are naturally low in sodium. Second, “beans are an underappreciated source of good-quality protein,” Brenes-Salazar notes. Adds Patton: “All members of the legume family are super healthy because they are full of plant-based protein and the kind of fiber that lowers cholesterol and helps to stabilize your blood sugar levels.” Also know: other heart-healthy legumes — pinto beans, red beans, kidney beans and black beans. And research indicates that eating about ¾ cup a day may even help you lose a little weight. But remember, canned beans can be high in salt, so either rinse them thoroughly in water or use dried beans. Getty Images 6. Avocados Why: “Despite avocados’ high fat content, the fat is heart healthy and monounsaturated,” says Christine Rosenbloom, a registered dietitian and coauthor of Food & Fitness After 50. “Avocado is also rich in fiber, potassium and magnesium, all nutrients associated with heart health. Avocados are sodium-free ... a plus for those with high blood pressure, and avocado oil has a high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it good for pan-searing foods.” A 2022 study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, of almost 70,000 women and more than 40,000 men — all free of coronary heart disease — linked a higher avocado intake with a lower risk of heart disease. Also know: Another study from Pennsylvania State University found that eating one avocado a day led to a slight decrease in unhealthy cholesterol. 7. Oatmeal Why: Touted for its healthy properties for a half-century, fiber-rich oatmeal cuts down on cholesterol absorption and contributes to gut health. “Oatmeal is a good source of healthy fiber, healthy fats and protein,” Patton explains. “Soluble fiber is really important for our digestive tract and keeping blood sugar levels stable.” A meta-analysis published in 2022 in the European Journal of Nutrition found that adding oats to the diet was linked to lower cholesterol levels. Also know: know: Because steel-cut oats, or Irish oatmeal, are less processed than other varieties, they have the most fiber — but remember they take longer to cook. ﻿ Oatmeal can be the foundation of a heart-healthy meal: “It provides an excellent platform for incorporating berries, chopped nuts, yogurt or other additions,” says Van Horn. 8. Whole-grain rices and quinoa﻿ Why: “The more a grain is kept intact, the more nutritional value it has,” says Patton. An analysis by the World Health Organization of about 40 years of studies on the health benefits of dietary fiber found it provided a 15 to 20 percent decrease in cardiovascular-related mortality, including heart disease, stroke, and type-2 diabetes. And whole grains can be good for weight, too: A 2021 Tufts University study found that middle- to older-age adults who ate at least three servings of whole grains daily saw smaller increases in waist size, as well as blood pressure and blood sugar. Also know: Whole-grain bread and cereal are also beneficial. But be wise when shopping. Look at the nutrition label and make sure “whole-grain” is the first ingredient — and watch for added sodium and sugars. “Typically, good whole-grain products have at least two and a half grams of fiber per serving, and less than 140 milligrams of sodium,” says Patton. ﻿9. Salmon Why: The AHA has long recommended eating fish — especially salmon and other oily fishes high in omega-3 fatty acids — twice a week to help stave off the risk of heart failure, stroke and other coronary disease. And a study published in 2022 in the AHA’s journal recommended eating three grams a day of omega-3 fatty acids like those found in salmon. It may not be just the omega-3s that are good for you; a 2018 study found that an ingredient in fish and other seafood called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) may also reduce hypertension-related symptoms. Also know The AHA recommends lake trout, herring, albacore tuna, sardines and mackerel. Should You Bother With Fish Oil?​ We've heard for years that fish oil supplements (and their omega-3 fatty acids) are magic pills against heart disease — in fact, at least 10 percent of Americans take them. However, recent research has cast doubt on their efficacy, including a study presented in November 2020 at the AHA's scientific meeting. It found that for 13,078 people who had heart disease (or were at high risk of it), fish oil pills did not reduce their risk of cardiac events compared with those on a placebo. Not only that, but atrial fibrillation, a potentially dangerous abnormal heart rhythm, occurred more often in those taking the supplement. The bottom line: Although eating fish regularly is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, supplements don't demonstrate the same effect as eating whole fish. ​​​​​ ﻿1﻿0. Blueberries Why: ﻿They’re the epitome of heart-healthy fruits, high in soluble fiber and polyphenols (those antioxidants that absorb free radicals) and vitamin C. A 2019 study out of London found that eating 200 grams of blueberries (about 1 1/4 cup, depending on the size) a day for a month led to lower blood pressure, and a second UK study found that eating 150 grams (about a cup) of blueberries a day lowered the risk of cardiovascular disease by 15 percent. Also know: All berries — strawberries, raspberries, blackberries — have heart-healthy credentials for their fiber as well as their flavonoids and antioxidants. Hate berries? Consider red grapes, which are high in resveratrol, a heart-healthy antioxidant. Getty Images 1﻿1. Broccoli and brussels sprouts Why: Though most veggies are great for cardiovascular health, broccoli and brussels sprouts are ace players. A 2020 Australian study found that these and other cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, are linked to a decline in blood vessel disease. They’re high in disease-fighting flavonoids and carotenoids as well as cholesterol-lowering fiber. Plus, like all veggies, their low caloric density means you can eat a lot without tipping the calorie scale. “You want to aim for such foods as part of a balanced diet because they're going to help with satiety,” Brenes-Salazar says. Also try: spinach, kale, baby greens, Swiss chard and collard greens. “The consensus is that three servings a day of dark-green leafy vegetables will reduce your total risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes,” Patton says. A 2021 study out of Edith Cowan University found that eating around two cup﻿s of nitrate-abundant leafy greens per day can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease by 12 to 26 percent. 1﻿2. Chili peppers Why: These hot little guys are high in a substance called capsaicin. It’s what sets your mouth on fire — but it also has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and blood-glucose-regulating effects. That’s good news for your heart: A 2020 study of 570,000 people found that those who ate chili peppers had a whopping 26 percent lower relative risk of cardiovascular mortality than those who rarely or never ate the peppers. Also know: What’s more, though not nearly as rich in capsaicin as the super-hot variety, sweet green and red peppers are also a good source of the mighty C. Should You Bother With Fish Oil?​ We've heard for years that fish oil supplements (and their omega-3 fatty acids) are magic pills against heart disease — in fact, at least 10 percent of Americans take them. However, recent research has cast doubt on their efficacy, including a study presented in November 2020 at the AHA's scientific meeting. It found that for 13,078 people who had heart disease (or were at high risk of it), fish oil pills did not reduce their risk of cardiac events compared with those on a placebo.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-ckm-syndrome/,"A Common Health Disorder You’ve Probably Never Heard Of What older adults need to know about the newly defined cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome By Michael Schroeder, AARP Comments En español Published June 13, 2024 AARP (Source: Shutterstock (2)) Even if they seem relatively distant in their positions in our bodies and autonomous in their roles, our organs are intimately, intricately connected. The gut talks to the brain; the liver can affect the lungs; and the health of your heart can influence the health of your kidneys. In fact, these last two — the heart and kidneys — are so closely intertwined that health experts have coined a new term to define patients who are at risk for their related illnesses. It’s called cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, and research suggests it’s exceptionally common. The American Heart Association says 1 in 3 U.S. adults have three or more risk factors for CKM syndrome, and it appears most adults are affected to some degree. In fact, a recent study published in the journal JAMA suggests nearly 90 percent of U.S. adults have some stage of CKM syndrome — a reflection of risk factors from being overweight to having chronic conditions like diabetes. What is cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome? Most people are familiar with heart disease, kidney disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. These four health conditions are among the most common in the U.S., and they are especially prevalent in older adults. Are You at Risk? To help people understand where they are on the CKM health risk spectrum specifically for heart disease, the AHA has a calculator. You plug in your sex, age, cholesterol, blood pressure﻿, body mass index (BMI) and a few other details, and the tool spits out your estimated 10- and 30-year percentage risk for developing cardiovascular disease or heart failure. But they’re also closely connected, and CKM syndrome — a concept recognized and a term first coined in an advisory by the American Heart Association last fall — encompasses their overlap. To put it another way: If you have a metabolic disorder (metabolic just has to do with getting energy from food) like type 2 diabetes or obesity, your risk goes up for either developing heart and kidney problems, or worsening them. Chiadi Ndumele, an associate professor of medicine and director of obesity and cardiometabolic research at Johns Hopkins University, says CKM syndrome is “a really potent driver” of premature deaths, including from heart disease. Cardiovascular deaths — once on the decline — are now increasing, evidence suggests. “This is thought to be all secondary to CKM syndrome,” says Ndumele, who coauthored the AHA advisory. The snowball effect The causes and effects of CKM syndrome are wide-ranging. It’s not a simple flowchart but more of a spiraling storm — such as when obesity, a major cause of kidney disease, leads to a cascade of metabolic issues. “When a kidney is damaged, by diabetes per se, or hypertension in particular, it produces a number of other abnormalities that affect the whole body — particularly the cardiovascular system,” says﻿ Katherine Tuttle, , professor of medicine in the division of nephrology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and a coauthor of the AHA advisory. “It causes inflammation, it raises blood pressure, it makes people more resistant to insulin, it makes the lipid disorders worse.” Are You at Risk? To help people understand where they are on the CKM health risk spectrum specifically for heart disease, the AHA has a calculator. You plug in your sex, age, cholesterol, blood pressure﻿, body mass index (BMI) and a few other details, and the tool spits out your estimated 10- and 30-year percentage risk for developing cardiovascular disease or heart failure. In turn, already high cholesterol levels can rise further; increasing insulin resistance inhibits the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar; and other changes take place — like kidney-disease-related calcium buildup in arteries\. Taken together, all these factors make circulation problems worse, which Tuttle says accelerates atherosclerosis, involving hardening and narrowing of the arteries, and heart failure. “These risk factors and diseases come in clusters,” echoes Rahul Aggarwal, a cardiovascular fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who conducted the analysis for the JAMA research on the prevalence of CKM syndrome. “So if you start developing one, you’re at more risk of developing others. But they also improve in clusters as well.” Lose weight or address an issue like high blood pressure with medication, and experts emphasize you could see health improvements that are wide-ranging. The CKM syndrome spectrum The JAMA study analyzed a pool of 10,762 adults ages 20 and older from across the country. The researchers sorted these adults by their stage of CKM syndrome risk based on AHA criteria and found: Stage 0: 10.6 percent had no CKM risk factors.Stage 1: 25.9 percent were assigned to the lowest level of CKM risk (besides not having it). This stage includes people who are overweight or who have obesity, who carry extra weight around their midsection, or who have higher than normal blood sugar levels.Stage 2: 49 percent of participants were classified as stage 2. These individuals met stage 1 criteria and also had metabolic risk factors, such as high triglycerides or blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.Stage 3: 5.4 percent were considered to be at stage 3. These individuals met stage 1 and 2 criteria, plus they had some early “subclinical” signs of cardiovascular disease, such as calcium buildup detected in the arteries.Stage 4: 9.2 percent were considered to be at stage 4. This is the highest level of CKM risk that includes stage 1, 2 and 3 risk factors, plus cardiovascular disease, which could be anything from arrhythmia to heart failure. “CKM syndrome occurs along a spectrum,” Ndumele says. What’s more, several nonmedical risk factors can influence where you fall on that spectrum, including economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, and where a person lives and works. Reversing CKM syndrome If you find yourself on the CKM spectrum, it’s important to know that you are not destined to move to higher stages, or even to stay where you are, Aggarwal says. For people who have some risk factors but don’t yet have heart or kidney disease, one of the biggest things is incorporating lifestyle changes, Aggarwal says, like exercising 150 minutes a week. That can help with losing weight and managing or preventing chronic conditions like diabetes.﻿ For those who do have more advanced risks related to everything from diabetes to high cholesterol, experts recommend talking to your doctor about whether medications could help, in addition to lifestyle changes. For example, there are medications that can help manage high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol, and treating these individual conditions can lower your risk for other related issues. There are also medications that can help people lose weight, and research suggests these drugs may also affect heart and kidney problems. A recent study evaluated the effect of semaglutide (the active ingredient in the diabetes medication Ozempic and the weight loss medication Wegovy) in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May, the study found the medication had significant benefits not only for addressing kidney disease but also for preventing cardiovascular deaths. “Kidney disease is probably one of the one of the strongest — if not the strongest — risk factors for cardiovascular disease,” says Tuttle, who was involved in the study. “If you can restore kidney health, then you have the opportunity for everything else to get better too.” Michael Schroeder is a freelance health writer and editor who's covered everything from chronic disease and mental health to medication side effects.

And one thing that doesn’t help is if you are taking medications that interfere with your body’s ability to cool itself down. Several pills and potions can affect how well the body is able to handle heat — an issue that is “particularly important for older people” because they tend to be on more of these medications, says Cec﻿ilia Sorensen, M.D., ﻿director of the Global Consortium on Climate Health and Education at Columbia University in New York City. It’s crucial to pay attention to this often-overlooked side effect during heat waves, which the Environmental Protection Agency says are increasing in both intensity and frequency — but it’s not just those stifling stretches that can be dangerous. Research shows that older patients with chronic medical conditions who take heat-sensitive medications can have medication-related problems throughout the entire summer. Medications and the Sun Is your medicine making your skin sensitive in the sun? These five drugs can put you at greater risk for sunburn-like symptoms, a rash or other unwanted side effects. Antibiotics: tetracycline (Panmycin), doxycycline (Vibramycin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ofloxacin (Floxin) Antifungals: griseofulvin (Gris-PEG) Antihistamines: lorat﻿adine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) Statin cholesterol medications: simvastatin (Zocor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol) Diabetes medications: sulfonylureas like ﻿glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Micronase) How do medications affect your heat tolerance? First, it’s important to understand how your body deals with heat and works to maintain that ideal internal temperature of 98.6 degrees. To cool off, your body has several tricks. One is perspiration, or sweat. When sweat evaporates from your skin, it cools the body. ﻿Another is when the blood vessels underneath your skin vasodilate (widen) and bring warm blood closer to your skin, allowing the skin to release heat. Several different medications, though, can interfere with this complex thermoregulation system by limiting the body’s ability to sweat or by reducing blood flow to the skin. Medications can also cause dehydration, and some may make the skin more sensitive to the sun, causing a rash or sunburn. Some individuals are more susceptible to these heat-related issues than others. Risk factors include being over 65, having chronic medical conditions and being overweight. Spending time outside during the warmest part of the day — especially if you are doing yard work, physical activity or exercise — also increases your risk. Dave Kent, a retired librarian, had a heart attack more than a decade ago; exercise, along with cardiac medications, is part of his treatment plan. But when the forecast calls for heat, he plans his outdoor activities for the cooler times of the day to avoid medication side effects. “I think having an active lifestyle ﻿and maintaining a healthy diet are the keys to dealing with whatever Mother Nature throws at us,” Kent says. 8 types of medications that don’t mix with heat Below are some examples﻿ of commonly used medications that can make it harder for your body to handle the heat. 1. Heart medications Prescribed for high blood pressure and blood clot prevention and to support the pumping function of the heart. Diuretics (also called water pills): furosemide (Lasix), chlorthalidone (Hygroton), hydrochlorthiazide (Microzide, HydroDiuril) Beta blockers: metoprolol (Toprol, Lopressor), atenolol (Tenormin), carvedilol (Coreg), propranolol (Inderal) ACE Inhibitors: lisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil) Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs): losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan) Antiplatelets: clopidogrel (Plavix) Medications and the Sun Is your medicine making your skin sensitive in the sun? These five drugs can put you at greater risk for sunburn-like symptoms, a rash or other unwanted side effects. Antibiotics: tetracycline (Panmycin), doxycycline (Vibramycin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ofloxacin (Floxin) Antifungals: griseofulvin (Gris-PEG) Antihistamines: lorat﻿adine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) Statin cholesterol medications: simvastatin (Zocor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol) Diabetes medications: sulfonylureas like ﻿glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Micronase) 2. Antidepressants Prescribed to treat depression and anxiety. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft) Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): duloxetine (Cymbalta), Venlafaxine (Effexor XR) Tricyclic antidepressants: amitriptyline (Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor) 3. Antipsychotics Prescribed for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other mental health disorders. Examples: risperidone (Risperdal) Quetiapine (Seroquel), Haloperidol (Haldol), Olanzapine (Zyprexa) 4. Central nervous system stimulants Prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Examples: dextroamphetamine (Adderall), methamphetamine (Desoxyn), methylphenidate (Ritalin) 5. Anticholinergics Prescribed for Parkinson’s disease and overactive bladder. Examples: benztropine (Cogentin), oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), tolterodine (Detrol) When is “hot” too hot? Weather forecasters use something called the heat index to measure what the weather actually feels like to you. The index considers both the temperature and humidity. For example, if the temperature is 100 degrees and the relative humidity is 55 percent, it will feel like 124 degrees out. At 80 degrees to 90 degrees, the National Weather Service advises caution with prolonged exposure. Note that the heat index is calculated with temperatures in the shade but can increase by up to 15 degrees in direct sunlight. Source: National Weather Service 6. Antihistamines Used for seasonal allergies, bug bites and beestings. Examples: diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 7. Decongestants. Used for the common cold and allergies. Examples: pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), phenylephrine (Sudafed PE), Oxymetazoline nasal spray (Afrin, Zicam, Dristan, Mucinex) 8. Dopaminergics. Prescribed for Parkinson’s disease. Examples: carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) If you are taking a medication that can be problematic in the heat, it’s a good idea to set aside time to discuss this with your doctor and hatch a plan for hot-weather days. “To avoid these problems, health professionals need to be aware of what medications put older people at risk and educate them and their caregivers,” Columbia University’s Sorensen says. There aren’t specific protocols for prescribing medications during hot weather, explains Soko Setoguchi, M.D., ﻿professor of medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and an expert on the health effects of medications. However, your doctor may want to lower the dose of a medication or sub in another. 5 tips for managing medications in the heat Don’t abruptly stop any medication. Many must be taken daily to keep the blood level high enough. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned.Make sure you store medications properly. Insulin, for example, can become less effective if left in the heat.Stay hydrated. Clues that you might be dehydrated are loss of body weight, making less urine and producing urine that’s darker than usual. Water from the tap (squeeze some lemon juice in for flavor) is a great way to hydrate, but be sure to check with your doctor if you have been put on fluid restriction. Avoid alcohol, as this can make you dehydrated.Keep cool. Wear light, loose-fitting clothes, pull down the shades at home, use a fan or air-conditioning, and avoid outdoor activity during the hottest times of the day.If a medication causes photosensitivity (see sidebar), wear sunscreen (SPF 15 or greater) and a sun-protective hat and clothes.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test/#comments_widget_id,"What to Know About the First FDA-Cleared Blood Test for Alzheimer’s Disease Doctors say the test could help individuals who are experiencing symptoms get an earlier diagnosis By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published May 19, 2025 AARP (Getty Images 2) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has green-lit a blood test that can help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. It is the first blood test to be cleared by the FDA for the disease, which affects more than 7 million older Americans and is marked by a decline in memory and thinking skills. The test, called Lumipulse, can detect abnormal clumps of protein in the brain, known as amyloid plaques. These plaques disrupt brain cell function and are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. PET scans and spinal fluid tests can also detect amyloid plaques and have been used for years to help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s. But the tests are expensive and, in the case of the lumbar puncture, invasive. They can also be inaccessible for people in rural areas. Lumipulse, on the other hand, requires only a blood draw in patients 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of the disease. “Having a blood test just makes it so much easier in being able to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,” said Charles Bernick, M.D., a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, based in Las Vegas. In its news release, the test’s manufacturer, Fujirebio Diagnostics, didn’t specify the cost of the test. People without symptoms shouldn’t test The newly approved blood test measures two proteins in the liquid part of the blood, known as plasma, and then calculates the ratio of these proteins, which is “correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan,” the FDA said. The test is only meant for older adults who are experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease; it is not a screening test. What’s more, the FDA said, the results should be used along with “other clinical evaluations or additional tests” to determine treatment options. In addition to brain imaging and lumbar punctures, doctors often use neurological exams and cognitive tests, for example, to diagnose a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. “It still becomes a diagnosis where you have to really look at the whole picture,” Bernick said. In recent years, the FDA has approved two medications for the treatment of Alzheimer’s — Kisunla (donanemab) and Leqembi (lecanemab). These drugs, which are given by infusion, don’t cure the disease but can help to slow the rate of decline in people in its early stages. Because they work by clearing amyloid plaques from the brain, the presence of amyloid must be confirmed before they can be prescribed. “They carry some risk. So if you’re going to use them or utilize them, you’ve got to be pretty sure the person has that protein in the brain,” Bernick said. Risks can include swelling and bleeding in the brain. New test could ‘revolutionize’ research and clinical care Some Alzheimer’s specialists have already been using blood tests not cleared by the FDA to help with a diagnosis of the disease. The FDA’s approval is not required for laboratory-developed tests such as these blood tests. Having the agency’s sign-off, however, confirms a test’s accuracy and opens the door for insurance coverage and more widespread use. Expert groups applauded the FDA’s May 16 announcement. Howard Fillit, M.D., co-founder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said that there’s been a “tremendous need” for blood tests and that having one will “revolutionize clinical care and clinical research” for Alzheimer’s. “It’s going to reduce the cost of care and diagnosis, and it’s going to give people the opportunity to get a definitive diagnosis and enter into clinical trials,” Fillit told AARP. “Today marks another important step in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis,” Maria C. Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead at the Alzheimer’s Association, said in a statement. “For too long, Americans have struggled to get a simple and accurate diagnosis; with today’s action by the FDA we are hopeful it will be easier for more individuals to receive an accurate diagnosis earlier.” Fillit predicts that we’ll see more blood tests in the near future, including tests that detect other key features of Alzheimer’s disease, such as inflammation in the brain. Having such tests could help doctors tailor a patient’s treatment as more medications come online. “It’s kind of going to look like cancer, where patients have a tumor, there’s a biopsy of the tumor, the tumor cells are taken to the lab, they’re characterized according to various biomarkers, and then a treatment plan with various drugs in combination is designed for the patient, and the patient receives multiple drugs affecting multiple pathways in the cancer cell,"" Fillit said. ""We’re going to have that for Alzheimer’s disease in the future. So this is just the beginning of really going into a new age of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and care and clinical trials.” Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments."

The vaccine, Nuvaxovid, is the third coronavirus shot to gain full approval, joining vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. It has been available under emergency use authorization for people 12 and older since 2022. Unlike the other two FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines, however, Nuvaxovid’s approval is limited to older adults and some people at higher risk for severe illness. Both Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines are approved for people 12 and older and are available under emergency use authorization for kids as young as 6 months old. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “Market research and U.S. CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] statistics indicate that older individuals and those with underlying conditions are the populations most likely to seek out COVID-19 vaccination seasonally,” Novavax President and Chief Executive Officer John C. Jacobs said in a statement. “This significant milestone demonstrates our commitment to these populations and is a significant step towards availability of our protein-based vaccine option."" According to federal data, older adults represent 94 percent of all COVID-19 deaths. And while hospitalizations are lower now than they were during peak periods, the hospitalization rate for adults 65 and older towers over the rates for younger populations. How Nuvaxovid differs from mRNA vaccines Novavax’s vaccine is based on a more traditional platform than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are. It’s a protein subunit vaccine, meaning it contains harmless copies of the COVID-19 spike protein and trains the immune system to recognize and attack this protein. Doctors have seen it as an alternative for people who remain skeptical about the mRNA vaccines or who may be allergic to them. The FDA approval did not specify what health conditions make someone age 12 to 64 eligible for Nuvaxovid. But according to the CDC, more than 20 categories of conditions, such as chronic lung disease, cancer and heart issues, can increase a person’s risk for severe illness from a coronavirus infection. ﻿ The FDA is requiring Novavax to conduct post-marketing trials to continue studying the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness. Novavax says it expects to be ready for the commercial delivery of the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine formula in the U.S. this fall, pending vaccine strain recommendations from FDA advisers. A meeting to discuss updates to the COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for May 22. A group of vaccine experts that advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations is scheduled to meet in late June.

For instance, your muscle tone plays a role as you age. To get a better read on the health risks associated with your weight, your doctor may combine BMI with a waist circumference measurement called the waist-to-hip ratio — your waist measurement divided by hip measurement. If most of your fat is around your waist, rather than at your hips, you’re at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk increases with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. Research shows waist-to-hip ratio may be an even stronger predictor of an early death from any cause than BMI, with higher waist-to-hip ratios increasing the risk. If your BMI falls in the overweight category and you have two or more risk factors for heart disease and related health conditions, losing weight is recommended. Even a weight loss of just 5 to 10 percent of your current weight will help lower your risk of developing diseases. A reasonable and safe rate of weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds per week. Top Tips For Overweight People Over 50 Open All 1. Start tracking your meals and snacks One of the secrets of healthy weight loss is to keep a record of everything you eat. Smartphone apps make it easy to do. Tracking can help you see associations you might not have noticed before. With those in mind, you can start to change your behavior and eat less. 2. Get moving Although eating less is key, exercise can be very helpful, especially if it replaces time spent snacking. You’ll see the biggest benefit if you go from being a couch potato to moderately active, but any activity helps and also lowers your risk for chronic diseases. 3. Weigh yourself every day Research suggests that a daily weigh-in helps you to drop pounds. People who weighed themselves every day lost even more weight than those who weighed themselves five times a week. Daily weighing seems to make it easier to adopt weight-loss behaviors. 4. Make sure to get a good night’s sleep People who sleep less than seven hours a night have higher rates of obesity. People on a weight-loss program who slept poorly developed higher BMIs and larger waistlines over a year’s time, research shows. Try turning off digital devices and TVs an hour before bedtime and create a soothing evening ritual to prepare for sleep. 5. Ask your doctor about weight-loss medications There are new drugs as well as combinations of older drugs that have been shown to be effective. You may be a candidate if you have a BMI of 27 to 29, along with another health condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/copd-and-other-lung-disease-warning-signs/,"Symptoms of COPD and Other Lung Diseases You Shouldn’t Ignore Often attributed to routine illnesses or age, these symptoms could signal something more serious By Rachel Nania, Updated August 06, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published November 14, 2022 / Updated August 06, 2024 PIKSEL / Getty Images David Lynch’s recent revelation that he has been diagnosed with emphysema is casting a new spotlight on the lung disease that is often, though not always, caused by smoking — a habit the Twin Peaks director said he ‘enjoyed … very much.’ ﻿ Emphysema, also referred to as chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), occurs when the lung tissue is damaged to the point where it becomes harder to breathe and keep the body properly oxygenated. Some of the early warning signs include shortness of breath, coughing up mucus and wheezing and chest tightness, according to the American Lung Association. At first these symptoms can be easy to overlook or mistake for another common ailment — especially during COVID-19 surges or cold and flu season. But doctors warn that they shouldn’t be ignored. “If symptoms are short-lived, then maybe it’s nothing. But if they go on, don’t just chalk it up to something like an infection. It may be something more serious,” says Jessica S. Wang Memoli, M.D., a pulmonologist and director of Bronchoscopy & Interventional Pulmonary at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. If you do have a lung disease like COPD, an early diagnosis means earlier access to treatments, which may forestall additional lung function loss. Here are three warning signs to pay attention to. 1. Shortness of breath While it’s true that lung function declines with age, meaning breathing may gradually become more difficult, sudden shortness of breath during routine activities is not normal. So if you notice that you’re out of breath out of the blue, that’s a sign you should see a doctor. “If you were able to walk up a couple flights of stairs a couple of weeks ago, and then today you just feel more winded, that could be a sign that maybe something else is going on,” Wang Memoli says. If your breathing is noisy — you’re wheezing — that’s another red flag. Also, pay attention to an overall low-energy feeling, which can be a warning sign of lung disease, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 2. A cough that won’t go away — and won’t get better It’s not uncommon for a routine respiratory infection to cause a cough that sticks around for a few weeks — maybe even longer. But if your cough prevails and doesn’t get better over time, “then it’s something to be a little bit more concerned about,” Wang Memoli says. The American Lung Association recommends getting checked out if you have a cough that lasts more than eight weeks. Also, see a doctor if you’re coughing up mucus or phlegm for more than a month. Coughing up blood is another sign that shouldn’t be ignored, says Gerard J. Criner, M.D., director of Temple Lung Center in Philadelphia. 3. Chest pain or tightness While often thought of as a cardiovascular issue, pain or tightness in the chest can be related to pulmonary complications, Wang Memoli says. A sharp stabbing pain that hits when you breathe in or cough could point to pneumonia. And chest tightness is a common symptom of COPD, which is when the airways become damaged (less air flows in and out), making it hard to breathe. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. Spotting symptoms early could improve treatment odds Many conditions that fall under the lung disease umbrella are treatable or manageable with medications and other therapies, Wang Memoli says. In some cases, like with lung cancer, the second most common cancer in the U.S., early detection “results in improvement in survival,” Criner says. Finding lung cancer early, when it’s more curable, can decrease mortality by up to 20 percent, research shows. And in other diseases, like COPD, which affects some 16 million Americans, “if you intercede and treat patients, they have a much better quality of life,” Criner adds. Treatment for COPD may include medicines like bronchodilators to relax the muscles around the airways and steroids to reduce inflammation. Some people with COPD may also receive oxygen therapy. During an evaluation, your doctor will likely ask about your work history and other possible exposures, since everything from air pollution to smoking can cause lung disease. “Someone who spent their lifetime working in construction, with or without good protection, is at risk for occupational lung disease,” says Jamie Garfield, M.D., a volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association and a professor of thoracic medicine and surgery at Temple Lung Center. “So if they develop the cough in their 60s … I would be suspicious for the beginning symptoms of an occupational lung disease,” Garfield adds. Your doctor may use a machine called a spirometer to measure how much air you can breathe in and out. This test is commonly used to help diagnose asthma and COPD. A chest X-ray can also help your doctor see what’s happening in the lungs. Lower your risk of lung disease You can do some things to lower your risk for developing lung diseases, health experts say. If you smoke, quit. Doing so is “very difficult,” Garfield acknowledges, but “your doctor has resources available to help.” And if you are 50 or older and are, or used to be, a heavy smoker, talk to your doctor about getting screened for lung cancer, Wang Memoli says. Screening recommendations from the American Cancer Society recently changed to include adults ages 50 to 80 (ACS) who currently smoke or used to smoke the equivalent of one pack a day for 20 years, no matter how long ago they quit. Also, test for radon (a colorless, odorless gas known to cause lung cancer) in your home, and steer clear of asbestos, dust and chemical fumes. And since some lung diseases are caused by germs, be sure to keep up with handwashing and stay up-to-date on your vaccines, including shots for flu and COVID-19. Health officials also recommend that people 65 and older get a pneumococcal vaccine, which can help protect against pneumonia. The take-home message, Wang Memoli says, is that “if [your symptoms] are significant enough where they’re bothering you, don’t ignore them.” Women and lung disease The number of women in the U.S. diagnosed with lung disease, and dying from lung disease, is on the rise.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-presbyopia/#comments_widget_id,"Presbyopia Symptoms and Treatments What you need to know about age-related vision changes By Lauren Evoy Davis, AARP Comments En español Published May 08, 2025 Liam Eisenberg If you’re starting to hold restaurant menus further and further away to see better, you are likely experiencing presbyopia. It’s not a disease, but a natural sign of aging, like graying hair. Presbyopia, with Greek and Latin origins roughly meaning “old eye” is the medical term for your vision becoming less clear over time, affecting approximately 128 million people in the United States, according to the American Optometric Association (AOA). It typically starts when people are in their 40s, when they start notice they're having a harder time clearly seeing things close up. Just as muscles anywhere else in your body often become less flexible as you get older, this happens as the eye muscles become less flexible, says Vicky Wong, president of the American Optometric Association. Symptoms and conditions The main symptom of presbyopia is the inability to see things clearly up close. Other symptoms or conditions include: Blurry eyesDouble visionEye strainHeadachesTrouble focusing Those with diabetes, heart disease, or multiple sclerosis might have an earlier onset of presbyopia. Some medications, such as diuretics, antidepressants, and antihistamines, may also bring on premature presbyopia. Antidepressants can also cause dry eyes and blurred vision. In addition, menopause brings on changes and dryness of the eyes. Diagnosis At an eye appointment, the doctor will put drops in your eyes to dilate them. The doctor will perform and eye exam to determine if you have presbyopia or another eye condition. If you are between the ages of 55 and 64 you should have an eye examevery one to three years, according to AOA. After age 65, you should visit your eye doctor annually. Treatments If untreated, presbyopia can inhibit your quality of life, and there are many options to help correct your vision. Reading glasses It’s a good idea to schedule a yearly eye exam to understand both your vision changes and your overall eye health. Your eye doctor might recommend that you get reading glasses. But this doesn’t mean you need to buy an expensive pair. You may be able to simply buy readers, which increase the close-up fonts and images. If your eyes have very different prescriptions, however, you may need prescription glasses, but when considering cost, you don’t have to buy them from the storefront at your eye doctor. Instead, ask for your prescription so that you can use it online or at discount stores. Contact lenses Contact lenses can be a good option for people who don’t want to keep glasses on hand. Lens types include: Bifocal: The lens has a line between the up-close and distance prescriptionsDiffractive: The lens focuses light by diffraction, which is bending light to two focal pointsMonofocal: One lens corrects one eye for distance, and the other lens for up closeMultifocal: Also called simultaneous vision, this lens has prescriptions for both up close and distance, but without the distinctive line of bifocals. You can choose lenses that you change daily or once per month. Daily lenses cost between $20 to $40 for a 30-day pack. Costs for monthly lenses range from $40 to $120 for lenses, but you can get them at a discounted bulk rate at big box stores. Many vision insurance plans cover eye exams and contact lenses, but may not cover them in full. Eye drops In 2021 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vuity﻿, prescription eye drops to treat presbyopia. You use them once daily, you can expect to get six to eight hours of clearer vision, according to Wong. “I have some patients that will use it just on the weekends, when they're out and about. If they're running errands or going to a kid's game, so that they don't have to keep bringing around their glasses,” says Wong. The drops are a low dose of a medication that makes the pupils smaller and increases the focal range, similar to a camera’s aperture, a fancy word for “opening,” according to Lisa Park, an ophthalmologist and associate professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. However, Park says the drops are not without risks, including, in rare cases, retinal detachment. You can expect to pay between $80 and $100. Insurance companies do not generally cover eye drops. Types of surgery There are several surgical options available, which greatly depend on each person’s vision needs, according to Shahzad I. Mian, M.D., professor of ophthalmology and director of W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Cataract surgery Mian says surgery to correct cataracts, when an aging eye lens becomes cloudy and hinders vision, can also correct presbyopia. This involves removing the lens and replacing it with a plastic lens. It creates monovision, which means one eye is corrected for up close and the other eye is corrected for distance. It may take some time for your brain to adjust. “People who have cataracts also have issues with their reading vision as well, but cataracts tend to become functionally visually significant more when you're in your 60s or older, on average,” Mian says. LASIK LASIK, short for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, is another option. LASIK surgery involves an ultraviolet laser to reshape the curvature of the cornea, the clear covering of the eye that refracts light. This procedure is also very quick and can create multifocal, bifocal, or other types of vision corrections. Side effects can include temporary fuzzy vision, dry eye or a halo effect. Be proactive with your eye health “Don’t ignore eye strain,” says Wong. With more and more people working from small screens on laptops and their smartphones, eye strain can worsen. If you’re struggling with eye strain or need to “reset” your eyes often, like every 15 minutes, it’s time to see an eye doctor.

Symptoms can vary profoundly depending on which areas of the brain are affected By Marlene Cimons Updated April 29, 2025 Reviewed by Justin Miller, Ph.D. Comments En español Published January 17, 2024 / Updated April 29, 2025 PM Images / Getty Images When people talk about dementia, they often mean Alzheimer’s disease, the illness that robs memories and renders a person unable to function in daily life. To be sure, Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, or the loss of cognitive function. But it’s not the only one. There are several other types. These include Lewy body dementia along with Parkinson’s dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia — the same condition actor Bruce Willis has. Some people can suffer from a combination of these, a condition known as mixed dementia. These illnesses result from a progressive destruction of brain cells, which is why they are often referred to as “neurodegenerative diseases.” But their symptoms can be strikingly different. The hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, for example, include memory loss and language changes (e.g., trouble finding words). With frontotemporal dementia, language or behavior changes are the most prominent symptoms while memory remains relatively less affected. Alzheimer’s patients “might have trouble remembering to take their medication,” says Andrew Budson, M.D., chief of cognitive and behavioral neurology and director of the Center for Translational Cognitive Neuroscience at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System. But in frontotemporal dementia, memory is much less affected than in Alzheimer’s disease. So a patient may say, “﻿ ‘I don’t think I want to take my medicine, I’d rather watch TV,’﻿ ” Budson says. “The outcome is the same, but the presentation is different.” One note: It’s important to distinguish the diseases above from the numerous health conditions and medications that can cause memory loss. Many of these are often reversible. 5 types of dementia﻿ There are currently no cures for these types of dementia, but treatments can improve some symptoms and newer therapies are being tested to slow down disease progression. 1. Alzheimer’s disease. An estimated 7.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s today, making it the most common form of dementia. For most people, symptoms first appear in the mid-60s or later. About one-third of all people 85 and older may have Alzheimer's disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. The causes of this type of dementia are not fully understood, but it most likely involves abnormal buildup of misfolded proteins known as amyloid plaques that form in the spaces between nerve cells, and tangles of a different protein called tau. The tangles build up inside nerve cells, breaking down cell-to-cell communications as the disease progresses.﻿ AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits Alzheimer’s affects a person’s memory and eventually the ability to think, reason and perform even the simplest of tasks. Two regions of the brain, which are responsible for memory — the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus — the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus — are particularly vulnerable early in the disease. Later, areas in the cerebral cortex become impaired. Those areas are involved in language, reasoning and social behavior. 2. Lewy body dementia. Two types of dementia make up this category: dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). BBoth involve abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain. These so-called Lewy bodies produce changes in brain chemicals that can alter movement, thinking, behavior and mood. In both DLB and PDD, people develop movement problems and changes in memory, executive functioning (e.g., planning, organizing) and the ability to identify visual and spatial relationships among objects. Some patients can also experience vivid hallucinations, seeing things that aren’t there, which can be distressing and hard for people to talk about, for fear of severe mental illness. ﻿ For people with DLB, the cognitive changes and motor changes happen around the same time, but people with Parkinson’s disease may have movement problems for years before cognitive changes occur, if they develop at all. It’s difficult to predict. One risk factor for both Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease is REM sleep behavior disorder, in which a person physically acts out their dreams while sleeping. One of Budson’s patients, a war veteran with Lewy body dementia, had a dream he was back in a war zone engaged in battle. “His wife complained one time she was being strangled by him,” Budson recalls. “Normally when we sleep and have a dream, we are paralyzed, and that’s why we don’t act it out. But patients with Lewy body are not paralyzed. They might run in their sleep. Swim in their sleep. Fight in their sleep.”﻿ 3. Vascular dementia. About 10 percent of all dementia cases are vascular, caused by strokes or other problems with blood flow to the brain. The lack of blood flow robs the brain of oxygen and nutrients. High blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, diabetes and high cholesterol can increase risk for vascular dementia. Symptoms depend on where in the brain the blood flow is blocked. If a person has multiple strokes or ministrokes, symptoms can worsen. “People lose functions because they develop one stroke after another,” Budson says. “It can be ministrokes, big ones or both. The first time I saw my patient he’d had a stroke that left him unable to write. The next time I saw him, he was unable to calculate the tip in a restaurant. And then he had difficulty dressing himself.” 4. Frontotemporal dementia. Unlike Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia most often strikes younger adults, between the ages of 45 and 64. It results from nerve cell damage in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, as the name suggests. There are two primary kinds of frontotemporal dementia. In one form, symptoms show up as unusual behaviors, emotional issues﻿ —﻿ such as acting or saying things impulsively without regard to other people’s feelings﻿ —﻿ and difficulty communicating. ​ In the other, the temporal lobes on the side of the brain — the area responsible for speech and language — are affected, creating difficulties understanding and speaking. People forget the meaning of words. “One of my patients with language problems actually forgot what the words for different body parts were,” Budson says. “He didn’t know what a knee or elbow or foot were.” This patient had what is known as the semantic version of ﻿primary progressive aphasia. People with this rare form of dementia may behave impulsively or make reckless financial decisions. “I had a patient some years ago who bought lottery tickets every evening after work,” says Paul E. Schulz, M.D., director of the Neurocognitive Disorders Center at the UT Health Houston McGovern Medical School. “He didn’t pay the mortgage on the office building for a year. His whole garage was stuffed with tickets, barrels full of tickets, millions of tickets.” Others will eat almost anything, says Budson, recalling a patient who “ate an entire jar of mayonnaise and then a raw steak.” 5. Mixed dementia. Sometimes symptoms come from more than one type of dementia. When a person with Alzheimer’s, for example, suffers a stroke, vascular dementia can result. When more than one type of dementia exists, the disease may progress faster. People older than 80 are especially vulnerable to mixed dementia.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/salt-substitutes/,"7 Salt Substitutes and How to Use Them Salt adds flavor, but most of us use too much. Here are several salt alternatives that won’t compromise taste By Lauren Bedosky, AARP Comments En español Published April 09, 2025 Levi Brown/Trunk Archive A dash of table salt to liven up a bland dish here and there may not seem like a big deal, but you’re probably getting more salt than you think. While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, most Americans are getting 3,400 mg a day on average. “Salt adds flavor to food, but eating too much of it can lead to some health issues,” says Laura M. Ali, a culinary nutritionist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Research shows that a high-salt diet is linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure (hypertension), which raises your risk of heart disease and stroke. “Cutting back on salt is a simple, effective way to lower those risks and protect your health,” Ali says. But limiting the salt in your diet doesn’t mean eating bland, flavorless foods. More and more people are turning to salt alternatives to improve their health without sacrificing taste. One 2024 study of adults ages 55 and older with normal blood pressure found those who replaced salt with a substitute were 40 percent less likely to develop hypertension over two years than those who kept using salt. Many salt substitutes on the market can turn basic dishes into culinary gems — little to no salt required. Here are several expert-recommended swaps for table salt. 1. Salt substitutes made with potassium chloride If you love the taste of salt and aren’t ready to kick it to the curb, try a low-sodium or sodium-free salt substitute like Nu-Salt, Morton Salt Substitute, McCormick’s NoSalt Original Sodium-Free Salt, or one of the Dash blends (formerly Mrs. Dash). Whereas table salt is made of sodium chloride, salt substitutes are products made entirely or partly of potassium chloride. Potassium chloride is a salt-like compound that tastes similar to sodium chloride. But, unlike sodium chloride, potassium chloride is beneficial for blood pressure. “Potassium is a mineral known for its ability to help lower blood pressure, but most Americans fall short of getting enough in their diets,” Ali says. “Potassium chloride salt substitutes can be a helpful choice for cutting down on sodium while boosting potassium intake — both of which can support healthier blood pressure in people with hypertension.” Replace traditional salt with a substitute made from potassium chloride and use it anytime you normally use salt, “like adding a little to a dish after it’s been cooked,” says Melissa Ann Prest, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The drawback of potassium chloride salt substitutes is that they can have a bitter or metallic flavor. Because of this, some prefer to use half potassium chloride salt substitute and half table salt, Ali notes. Getty Images 2. Lemon Citrus fruits like lemons are a source of acid, which mimics the role of salt when added to dishes. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice adds a bright flavor and brings out the other flavors in food, Ali says. “Squeezing a lemon over roasted broccoli or sauteed spinach is a delicious way to brighten up the vegetables and reduce their bitterness,” she continues. You can also add lemon zest to other spices to make a rub for meat or give a quick squeeze of lemon over chicken noodle soup or fish right before serving. 3. Vinegar “Just as lemon juice brightens a dish, the acid in vinegar has a similar effect,” Ali says. While there are many types of vinegar, balsamic vinegar or apple cider vinegar tend to work best. Both have a rich, sweetly tart flavor that compliments many different dishes. “A splash of vinegar over roasted vegetables brightens their flavor and helps reduce some of the bitterness, especially in cruciferous veggies,” Ali says. “I love tossing roasted Brussels sprouts with balsamic vinegar right before serving,” she adds. Getty Images 4. Rosemary This bold herb has a piney, slightly peppery flavor. It’s delicious on roasted meats, vegetables, beans, and soups or stews, Ali says. Rosemary is tough and can withstand heat, making it a great choice to season foods while they are cooking, she adds. “My favorite ways to use rosemary are to toss it with potato wedges and olive oil before roasting, and I love to add a sprig of fresh rosemary to a pot of beans while they cook, allowing the flavor to infuse into the beans,” Ali says. 5. Basil “Basil is another herb that can brighten up and bring out the flavors of a dish,” Ali says. It has a sweet, peppery taste that works well in tomato sauces, sandwiches, soups, stews, and more. “There is nothing better than chopped fresh basil on top of pizza, pasta, or an omelet,” Ali notes. Fresh basil can also brighten up fruit. Ali suggests tossing it with fresh watermelon or mixing it with strawberries for a flavorful twist. Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images 6. Black Pepper There’s a reason black pepper is the companion of table salt. “Black pepper contains a chemical called capsaicin that causes a mild irritation and makes your taste buds a bit more sensitive to salty flavors,” Ali says. Adding a sprinkle of black pepper to your food can help you cut back or even nix table salt entirely. As a bonus, black pepper is a versatile spice that can enhance almost any food with its mild, spicy flavor, Ali says. She suggests seasoning meat or poultry with black pepper before cooking to help infuse the dish with flavor during cooking. Black pepper is also a great choice for adding a bit of a kick to steamed vegetables after cooking and boosts the flavor of sauces, salad dressings, soups, and stews, Ali notes. 7. Fresh Garlic This root vegetable offers a pungent, spicy flavor when raw but transitions into sweet, buttery when cooked. Thanks to its strong presence, garlic can boost the flavor of many dishes without the help of table salt. “Fresh garlic can be used in many different ways, from sautéing to roasting, and adds a ton of flavor,” Prest notes. Incorporate garlic into sauces, soups, and stews, or add to pizza, pasta, steak, and potatoes.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/elderberry-for-cold-and-flu/#comments_widget_id,"Can Elderberry Cure Your Cold Symptoms? The supplements are marketed as an immune-boosting remedy, but like all pills and potions, can come with risks for some By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published February 19, 2025 Getty Images You’re laid low by a fever, chills, runny nose, congestion. Can elderberry deliver relief? Thanks to what are believed to be the herbal supplement’s immune-boosting superpowers (the tiny purple berry is loaded with vitamins and antioxidants), elderberry is having something of a moment. A growing number of people are reaching for elderberry juice, syrup, gummies, capsules, tea and tablets to help them power their way through a cold or the flu, while others are simply looking to reap the perceived health benefits. All, despite the fact that high-quality research into whether elderberry actually helps prevent and treat common respiratory infections is lacking, and the small studies that do exist are far from conclusive. Complicating matters, elderberry supplements — like all herbal supplements — are not subjected to the same rigorous testing, manufacturing and labeling standards as prescription and over-the-counter medications. For example, the label on an herbal supplement can include broad promises about the product’s impact on the body — that it “reduces stress” or “promotes digestive comfort.” And unlike highly scrutinized prescription and over-the-counter medications, standardization with supplements is lacking. “Unlike with pharmaceutical drugs, there’s no requirement that botanicals need to be prepared in any standardized way,” says Pieter Cohen, M.D., an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who studies supplement safety. “What we’ve found when we analyze botanical supplements is that the amount of active compound varies widely from one brand to another. So when you go to the store and buy elderberry, you have no idea what you’re getting.” What is elderberry? According to The Plant Humanities Lab, the dark violet-black berry’s beginning as a go-to for colds and flu dates back to 400 B.C. That’s when Hippocrates — the Greek physician known as the “father of medicine” — called the elder plant his “medicine chest” because of the many health woes it seemed to treat — from constipation to hemorrhoids to insect bites and upper respiratory infections. Although there are a number of elderberry varieties, it’s the black elderberry (Sambucus nigra) that’s believed to possess the most immune-boosting bona fides. It’s among the richest sources of plant compounds known as polyphenols, specifically anthocyanins, which have been shown to help immune function. Supplements aren’t without risks, side effects When people are considering any health intervention, they should take two things into account, says Mary L. Hardy, M.D., a botanical medicine and integrative medicine expert with the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine. “The first is safety, and a close second is efficacy. Is it safe, and does it work?” Apart from the big caveat with elderberry — when eaten raw, the berries can be poisonous and make you sick — “it has a good safety record,” says Hardy, citing a review of studies published in 2021 in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies. Although the researchers found that the evidence for effectiveness was mixed, they concluded that the herb appeared to be a safe option for soothing upper respiratory symptoms. It’s easy to assume that anything as ubiquitous as elderberry — supplements are sold online and on store shelves — isn’t capable of doing serious harm. But doctors and public health professionals caution that’s not true, especially for people with chronic conditions. “Elderberry may overstimulate the immune system, which can worsen autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or multiple sclerosis, and it can react with certain medications or cause upset stomach,” says Maria Portela, M.D., associate professor at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences and chief of Family Medicine. If you have a high fever or a preexisting condition like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes, in addition to those mentioned above, talk to your doctor before taking any supplement. Another consideration: “Elderberry may help relieve symptoms, but it shouldn’t replace antiviral medications such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or baloxavir (Xofluza) for high-risk populations such as people who are immunocompromised,” Portela says. “Unlike elderberry, these medications have undergone rigorous clinical trials and are FDA-approved for influenza treatment,"" she says. If you take any type of medicine or supplement, you should also check with your doctor before trying elderberry. “Elderberry and other botanical supplements can interact with other medications or supplements and might have other side effects,” Cohen says. “In the case of elderberry, it might have a diuretic effect or make people a little dehydrated. But that effect is unpredictable because you can’t really know how much of the active ingredient is in the supplement. Because of the lack of standardization, you’re in a bind.” Shopping for supplements: What to look for If your doctor gives you the green light and you want to add elderberry to your cold and flu cabinet, some clues on the label can help you choose wisely, Hardy says. For instance, in addition to the common name (elderberry), look for the botanical name (Sambucus nigra) on the label. “If I picked up an herbal product and it had the common name but not the scientific name, I would put that product back,” Hardy says. In addition, she says, “a good label will also tell you which part of the plant was used (that should be the berry); how the product was managed (for instance, as crushed dried berry or as an extract); as well as how much of a marker compound is in that extract.” In herbal supplements, the quantity of a marker compound is a tip-off to the quality of the product. Although there are no guarantees that herbal supplements will live up to their claims or be side-effect-free, the following seals of approval offer some assurance that what’s on the label matches what’s in the product: USP (United States Pharmacopeia), NSF (NSF International), or CL (ConsumerLab.com). All of these indicate the product has been tested, audited and certified by an independent organization, “though it’s important to remember that doing so doesn’t guarantee a product’s safety,” Portela says. Bottom line: “Elderberry supplements may offer mild benefits in reducing the duration and severity of colds or flu,” Portela says. “It should not, however, replace flu vaccines, antiviral medications, or supportive treatments such as hydration and rest.” Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Please stand (don’t use your hands) to give tribute to the one exercise that fitness gurus say stands out among the rest for healthy aging. Now be seated again. Consider that your first rep. Yes, a great workout challenges all of the major muscle groups in your upper and lower body. But if you have time for only one exercise, you’ll get the most bang for your buck by doing squats — the classic move in which you slowly lower your bottom to seated level, then stand back up. AARP The Magazine Special Edition AARP takes a look at how aging has evolved and improved over the decades — and how it likely will change in the years ahead. Read more stories from the Age Issue “The squat is the most important exercise for seniors,” says Eric Daw, a personal trainer dedicated to older adults and founder of Omni-﻿Fitt in Toronto, Canada.﻿ “When you have to go to the washroom, that’s a squat. When you get in the car, that’s a squat. Every time you sit down or stand up, that’s a squat. If you don’t do them well, it affects the way you live.” Wall Sits Can Lower Blood Pressure Squats strengthen all of the muscle groups in your legs, including your calves, quadriceps, hamstrings and glutes, as well as muscles in your lower back and core. Those muscles provide the foundation for most activities of daily living. Squats are the antidote to soft couch-cushion syndrome — those challenging moments when we struggle to get up from that deep, old sofa. They can also help protect your joints, improve your balance and prevent falls, says Denise Austin, for 40 years one of America’s best-known fitness experts and authors. “Squats are one of the best overall exercises,” she says. “They strengthen the major muscles of the lower body we need to keep strong and also protect two joints we need help with on a regular basis — our knees and our hips.” Let’s Play Pickleball!

Get in position If you’re new to squats, choose a spot where you can hold on to the kitchen counter, a table or another steady surface. Holding on for stability makes it easier to focus on your form without worrying about your balance, Austin says. Set your feet about shoulder-width apart or a little wider. (If you have hip issues, it’s OK to have your legs a little farther apart.) Toes should face slightly outward. 2. Lower into a squat Keeping your back straight, chest up and heels planted, push your hips back like you are sitting in a chair. Try to keep your weight evenly distributed on both feet as you do the exercise, with your weight mostly on your heels, not your toes, says Lori Michiel, founder of Lori Michiel Fitness, which specializes in senior fitness in the home. Make sure your knees do not extend forward over your toes, because that can hurt your knees. If you have knee or hip issues, you don’t need to do a deep bend. The coming-up part of the exercise is what really builds strength, Austin says. 3. Repeat Aim for two sets of eight to 10, at a tempo of two seconds down, two seconds up. Inhale on the way down and exhale on the way up. As your body tires at the end of the set, make sure you’re not hunching over or letting your knees cave in. For the best results, do the exercise two or three times a week. 4. Get your arms in play Mary Beth Koeth As you start to build strength, you can try doing your squats without holding on to anything. For balance, let your arms rise parallel in front of you on the downward part of the squat, then drop them to your sides when you stand up, Austin suggests. You can see Austin demonstrating how to do a mini-squat in the video below. Another option is to cross your arms across your chest. That can help keep you upright if you tend to hunch over, Daw says. 5. For a greater challenge, add resistance Mary Beth Koeth Once you can do two sets of 15 without feeling any muscle soreness afterward, you’re ready to add some weight. The easiest way is to hold a pair of dumbbells, Daw says. “That’s how you build strength faster,” he says. Start with low weights and build up. Christine Rösch New Squats for Older Legs Once you’ve mastered the basic squat, you might want to try one or more of these variations. Why? Your muscles are fast learners, so within four to six workouts, they’ll figure out how to do the same old squat exercise using less energy and fewer muscle fibers — leaving you with fewer results. Just the slightest change to the squat reminds your muscles to pay attention, which improves your overall strength and fitness and helps enhance balance. Split squats Instead of keeping your feet alongside each other, step forward with your left foot and plant it about three feet in front of your right foot. Your left foot should be flat on the floor, while your right foot — because of the angle — should have only the ball of it touching the floor with your heel slightly elevated. Either put your hands on your hips or let your arms hang down at your sides. Holding this posture, slowly squat down until your left thigh is parallel to the floor — your right knee will naturally lower down to just above the floor. Push yourself back up, repeat 6 to 8 times, then switch positions (putting your right foot forward) and repeat 6 to 8 more times. Heel-raise squats Get into the same position as a regular squat. Squat down as usual, then stand back up, but once you’re back in a standing position, keep raising up by lifting your heels off the floor as far as you can without losing balance (even a centimeter off the floor still counts). Pause at the top for a second or two if possible — if you can’t for now, that’s OK, you’ll get there! — then lower your heels back down to the floor. Repeat 8 to 10 times. Dumbbell-offset squats This exercise forces your body to find its balance. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart holding a light dumbbell in each hand. Curl the weight in your left hand up and rest the dumbbell on your left shoulder — leave your right arm hanging down at your side. Do one set of 8 to 10 repetitions of squats. Once finished, switch positions (resting the dumbbell in your right hand on your right shoulder, keeping your left arm straight) and perform a second set of 8 to 10 repetitions. Side-kick squats Position yourself as if you were about to do a traditional squat, but bring your hands up in front of your chest. Squat down, then as you push yourself back up into a standing position, shift your weight onto your right leg and gently sweep your left leg out to the side, so that you use only your right leg to push yourself back up. Bring your left foot back down into the starting position, then squat down once again, this time shifting your weight onto your left leg as you rise and gently sweep your right leg out to the side. Continue alternating from left to right for 8 to 10 repetitions. — Myatt Murphy, certified strength and conditioning specialist Mary Beth Koeth Mary Beth Koeth Christine Rösch New Squats for Older Legs Once you’ve mastered the basic squat, you might want to try one or more of these variations.

Push yourself back up, repeat 6 to 8 times, then switch positions (putting your right foot forward) and repeat 6 to 8 more times. Heel-raise squats Get into the same position as a regular squat. Squat down as usual, then stand back up, but once you’re back in a standing position, keep raising up by lifting your heels off the floor as far as you can without losing balance (even a centimeter off the floor still counts). Pause at the top for a second or two if possible — if you can’t for now, that’s OK, you’ll get there! — then lower your heels back down to the floor. Repeat 8 to 10 times. Dumbbell-offset squats This exercise forces your body to find its balance. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart holding a light dumbbell in each hand. Curl the weight in your left hand up and rest the dumbbell on your left shoulder — leave your right arm hanging down at your side. Do one set of 8 to 10 repetitions of squats. Once finished, switch positions (resting the dumbbell in your right hand on your right shoulder, keeping your left arm straight) and perform a second set of 8 to 10 repetitions. Side-kick squats Position yourself as if you were about to do a traditional squat, but bring your hands up in front of your chest. Squat down, then as you push yourself back up into a standing position, shift your weight onto your right leg and gently sweep your left leg out to the side, so that you use only your right leg to push yourself back up. Bring your left foot back down into the starting position, then squat down once again, this time shifting your weight onto your left leg as you rise and gently sweep your right leg out to the side. Continue alternating from left to right for 8 to 10 repetitions. — Myatt Murphy, certified strength and conditioning specialist ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Heck, I love dessert, period. And I actually eat it a lot more often than one would guess. I'm very careful that my meals do not contain hidden sugars (did you know that 2 tablespoons of bottled salad dressing can have more than a cookie?) so I can enjoy desserts without exceeding recommended daily allowances for sugar overall. I know I'm not alone in craving chocolate and sweets and just baking more in general as we stay safely home these days. Instead of following a super fattening recipe that could really set you back, I hope you'll try one of these. Chocolate Not-Only-In-Your-Dreams Cake I dreamed of eating a rich, flourless chocolate cake like this for years; I'm one of those “There's no such thing as chocolate cake that's too rich” types. Even when dieting, I have to “cheat” with chocolate from time to time just to keep my sanity. And then came this cake. It's as rich as they come, and I love it more than any other ﬂourless chocolate espresso cake I've had. Plus, it packs 6 grams of ﬁber, so it really is guilt free! If you want to impress your friends (when you're able to see them) or if you're in quarantine alone, store some in the freezer, unbaked, in the ramekins placed within an airtight container. When you need a no-fuss dessert, pop the ramekins in a glass pan filled with some water, as described below, and bake for 30 to 32 minutes. Ingredients Butter-ﬂavored cooking spray1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce1 teaspoon vanilla extract4 large egg whites1 cup dark or light brown sugar (not packed)3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1/4 teaspoon very ﬁnely ground espresso beans (or 1/2 teaspoon instant coffee)1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon powdered sugar, optional4 raspberries, optionalFour 3 1/2 -inch-diameter ramekins (or any small souffle dishes or heat-proof bowls that are a least a few inches tall) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously mist four 3 1/2 -inch-diameter ramekins with spray. Place them side by side in an 8-by-8-inch baking pan. Add water to the pan until it reaches halfway to the top of the ramekins. Use a sturdy whisk or spatula to mix the applesauce, vanilla, egg whites and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl until well combined. Add the cocoa powder, espresso and salt. Stir until just combined and no lumps remain. Divide evenly among the ramekins (each ramekin will be about two-thirds full). Bake for 21 to 24 minutes, until the tops look silky and puff slightly and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out a bit wet (do not cook them long enough for the toothpick to come out dry). Remove from the oven and carefully transfer the ramekins from the water in the baking pan to a cooling rack. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Then invert each ramekin onto a dessert plate. Let stand for 1 minute, and then slowly lift off the ramekin (the cakes should come out on their own; if they don't, run a knife around the edge of the cakes to loosen them). Cool for another 5 to 10 minutes. Use a ﬁne sieve to evenly dust each cake with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar, if desired. Place one raspberry on the center of each cake, if using.

This corn bread requires only basic ingredients, and no mixer. It's excellent for breakfast, lunch or dinner with your favorite pot of low-fat chili. Ingredients Butter-flavored cooking spray (or canola or avocado oil spray)3/4 cup yellow corn meal1 1/4 cup unbleached flour2 teaspoons baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 cup fat-free vanilla yogurt (use any vanilla or plain yogurt; if using plain, add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)4 egg whites, lightly beaten (use 2 whole eggs if you're “conserving” and don't mind the extra fat/calories)3/4 cup sugar3/4 cup skim milk (or any nondairy milk you have on hand)1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract1 tablespoon butter, melted1 small jalapeno cut into thin rounds, if desired Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Mist an 8-by-8-inch nonstick baking pan or baking dish with spray. Courtesy Devin Alexander In a medium bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. Set it aside. In a large bowl, using a sturdy whisk or spoon, mix the yogurt, egg whites and sugar until they are just blended. Mix in the milk, vanilla and shortening. Then add the dry ingredients and stir them in until they are just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place the jalapeno rounds evenly over top, if using. Bake the bread for approximately 28 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with some sticky crumbs attached (because of the low fat content, it won't be “dry” until it's overcooked — it should be sticky, but not wet). Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Cut into 10 equal pieces. Serve warm or store in an airtight plastic container in the refrigerator or freezer to eat later.

Mitch Mandel Naked Apple Tart In culinary school, I used to make a tart very similar to this one, only it had a crust with enough butter to require a week of working out! Now, I enjoy it naked — without a crust, that is. I prefer the look of this “tart” when it's baked in a round or oval dish. You can use a similar-size square or rectangle dish, if necessary. Note that the tart cooks for quite a while, allowing the apples to transform into layers of soft, sweet deliciousness. The top of the tart will start to look burnt, but don't worry, it's not. It's just the result of juice and cinnamon caramelizing onto the apples — oh, so sweet! Ingredients Butter-flavored cooking spray (or canola oil or avocado oil spray)2 large crisp apples (such as Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Pink Lady or Honey Crisp), peeled3/4 cup 100 percent apple juice (not from concentrate)2 tablespoons coconut sugar (or substitute unpacked light or dark brown sugar)2 teaspoons unsalted butter, melted (salted will work)1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly mist a 10-inch ceramic or glass tart dish with cooking spray. Cut the apples in half lengthwise and remove the cores. Slice each half lengthwise into very thin slices. Starting from the outer edges of the dish, arrange the apple slices, laying them horizontally, in tightly overlapping circles in the bottom of the dish, until all of the apple slices are used (they will make a rose or flower blossom pattern). In a small bowl, whisk together the apple juice, sugar, butter and cinnamon until well combined (the sugar and cinnamon will not dissolve completely). Pour half of the apple juice mixture evenly over the apples. Reserve the remaining half. Bake for 30 minutes. Pour the reserved mixture evenly over the apples. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer, or until the apples are very tender and the glaze has caramelized on the top and around the edges of the tart (it should look almost burnt — dark brown, but not blackened). Cool for 5 minutes, then divide among 4 serving plates or dishes and serve. Makes 4 servings.

Pecan Praline Cookie Thins When my Facebook friends learned that I was working on an all-dessert book, I immediately got inundated with requests for re-creating favorite high-cal classics. One of the most popular requests was for pecan pie. These scrumptious cookies, which are ridiculously low in fat and calories compared to pecan pie, are an ode to those requests. Note: Packages of pecans that say either “dry-toasted” or “dry-roasted” are perfect for this recipe. Just make sure the pecans are not raw — the cookies won't have as much flavor. Mitch Mandel Ingredients Butter-flavored cooking spray1 large egg white2 tablespoons coconut sugar (unpacked light or dark brown sugar works too)1/3 cup unsalted dry-toasted finely chopped pecans (finely chopped walnuts if you don't have them) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously mist 8 cups of a nonstick standard muffin tin with spray. Whisk together the egg white and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the pecans and stir until well combined. Spoon the batter (about a scant 1 tablespoon each) into the prepared muffin tin, making sure to distribute the pecans evenly between each muffin cup. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly crisped around the edges, being careful not to burn them. Cool the tin on a rack for 5 minutes, or until the cookies have cooled slightly. Remove them to a cooling rack and let them cool completely. Serve immediately or store in a cookie tin for up to 5 days. Makes 4 servings.

Lemon–Poppy Seed Mini-Muffins If you're like me and have an undying sweet tooth, these muffins are the perfect solution. Though I tend to eat them for breakfast after I've “been good” and had an egg white omelet, they're actually perfect for any time of the day. They're tiny, yet satisfying. With only about 40 calories and a half-gram of fat each, how can you go wrong with one … or two? Ingredients Butter-flavored cooking spray (or canola oil or avocado oil spray)1 cup whole grain oat flour (or use all-purpose flour)1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda1⁄4 teaspoon baking powder1⁄4 teaspoon salt1⁄2 cup lite vanilla yogurt (or whatever vanilla, plain or lemon yogurt you have)3 large egg whites (or 1 egg and 1 egg white)1⁄3 cup honey1 teaspoon vanilla extract1⁄2 teaspoon lemon extract1 tablespoon grated lemon peel (or 3 tablespoons fresh lemon zest)2 teaspoons poppy seeds (or chopped dry roasted almonds or walnuts) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Mist 20 cups of a mini-muffin tin with spray. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the flour for about 1 minute, or until it is the consistency of all-purpose flour with no coarse grains remaining. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Sift the mixture twice. (If you don't have a sifter, put the mixture in a fine sieve and just tap it with your hand over a bowl until it's “sifted"") In a medium mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, egg whites, honey, vanilla extract and lemon extract with a sturdy whisk or spatula until well mixed. Stir in the reserved flour mixture until just combined. Stir in the lemon peel and poppy seeds (or nuts). Spoon the batter into the 20 prepared muffin cups. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of one muffin comes out sticky (not at all wet, but sticky crumbs are OK).

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/rarest-eye-color/,"What Is the Rarest Eye Color in the World? How many eye colors are there, and why your shade is unique to you By Hallie Levine, Updated February 20, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published August 17, 2022 / Updated February 20, 2025 Juliet White / Getty Images At some point, you’ve probably wondered what the rarest eye color is. The answer is green, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). Only about 2 percent of the world’s population sport this shade. As to why, that answer isn’t so simple. “We used to think only one gene determined eye color,” says Julie Kaplan, M.D., a physician at the Center for Personalized Genetic Healthcare at Cleveland Clinic. In high school biology class, for example, you probably learned that brown was dominant and blue was recessive, so two blue-eyed parents would not be able to have a baby with brown eyes. The truth, however, is a bit more complicated, Kaplan notes. What determines your eye color? About 75 percent of eye color is due to one gene, OCA2. It makes melanin, a substance in your body that produces hair, eye and skin pigmentation. If you inherit two nonfunctional copies of the OCA2 gene from your parents, you will go on to develop blue eyes. But if you have at least one functional copy, your eyes will be darker, on the spectrum of green, hazel or brown. Eye Color in the U.S. ​The American Academy of Ophthalmology surveyed more than 2,000 Americans to determine what color eyes they have. Below are the results of that 2014 Harris Poll survey.​​ 45 percent had brown eyes​ 27 percent had blue eyes​ 18 percent had hazel eyes​ 9 percent had green eyes ​1 percent had eyes a color not listed above ​Note: Survey weighted to reflect the United States population at that time. In case you were planning to decorate your impending grandbaby’s nursery to match the color of their eyes, be prepared to be disappointed. It is impossible to predict what color their orbs will be. “There are several different genes involved, which we’re just beginning to learn about and understand,” Kaplan explains. HERC2, for example, is a gene that turns the OCA2 gene on or off as needed. Different variations of it can cause the OCA2 gene to produce less melanin, which leads to lighter-colored eyes. There are at least eight other genes that influence eye color. In the meantime, you can take comfort in the fact that your own eye color is like your fingerprints: something that is unique to you. The original human eye color Brown eyes are the most common: Over half the people in the world have them, according to the AAO. In fact, about 10,000 years ago, all humans had brown eyes. Scientists speculate that their elevated levels of melanin helped protect people from the sun’s damaging rays. But as people moved from the sweltering climates of Africa and Asia to the cooler environments of Europe, there was less need for this protection. At some point in history, as humans migrated north, a gene mutation occurred to reduce melanin production, says Kaplan. When the eyes have less melanin, they absorb less light. That means more light is scattered out from the iris, or colored part of the eye, which reflects off the surroundings. Eyes with the smallest amount of melanin in them will appear blue, while those with a little more melanin will appear green or hazel.​ Eye Color in the U.S. ​The American Academy of Ophthalmology surveyed more than 2,000 Americans to determine what color eyes they have. Below are the results of that 2014 Harris Poll survey.​​ 45 percent had brown eyes​ 27 percent had blue eyes​ 18 percent had hazel eyes​ 9 percent had green eyes ​1 percent had eyes a color not listed above ​Note: Survey weighted to reflect the United States population at that time. Why green eyes aren't really green Your iris determines the color of your eyes. It is made of two layers and for nearly everyone, the back layer has brown pigment. Brown and hazel eyes get their color from melanin, but according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology blue eyes aren't really blue. Blue eyes don't have any blue pigment in the front layer of the iris, causing the fibers to scatter and absorb some of the longer wavelengths of light. More blue light gets reflected out, and the eyes appear to be blue. For green and hazel eyes, one or both layers of the iris contain light brown pigment. Green eyes don't have any green pigment, but they do have lipochrome, a yellowish, fat-soluble pigment that also gives eye yolks and butter their color. The scattering of light combined with the lipochrome and the brown pigment makes the eyes appear green. Hazel eyes, which are a combination of brown, gold and green, happen when the iris has more melanin than someone with brown or green eyes but less melanin than someone with brown eyes, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Different colored eyes Some people have a condition in which each of their eyes is a different color. With this condition, called heterochromia, a person’s iris color doesn’t match. When a person is born with it or develops it soon after birth, it’s called congenital heterochromia. Although rare in humans, it’s relatively common in cats, horses and dogs (especially Australian sheepdogs, Dalmati﻿ans and a few other breeds.) Much of the time, heterochromia is caused by genetics, but when it develops in adult, it can be due to a medical condition such as glaucoma or eye tumors.

Most people’s eyes are blue, green or brown, with some shades in between, notes Kaplan. This explains why your eyes may be dark green or hazel or even appear bluish gray. While Elizabeth Taylor made headlines with her violet eyes, her eyes were in fact blue. Blue eyes get their color from light that is coming in and being reflected out, so it is not surprising that they appeared as assorted colors based on lighting conditions. Makeup can bring out certain colors in the eye, Kaplan adds. Taylor also reportedly had a double row of eyelashes, a condition doctors call distichiasis, which helped accentuate her famous eyes. Some people with albinism do appear to have violet eyes, because the blood vessels in the back of their eyes can be seen under certain light conditions. People with albinism have little or no production of melanin pigment, which affects the color of skin﻿, hair and eyes.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fda-restricts-covid-vaccine-access/,"Can You Still Get a COVID-19 Vaccine at Any Age? Health officials announce changes that will likely curb access to shots for some people under age 65 By Rachel Nania, Updated May 30, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published May 21, 2025 / Updated May 30, 2025 Getty Images U.S. health officials are proposing changes to recommendations for the coronavirus vaccine just months ahead of the fall vaccine season. The developments are raising new questions and creating some confusion about who could — and should — get the shot. Earlier this month, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, M.D., and FDA commissioner Martin Makary, M.D., published in article in the New England Journal of Medicine saying that rather than making the shots available to all individuals 6 months and older, like they have been for several years, the agency plans to limit COVID vaccine eligibility to adults 65 and older and individuals with at least one underlying health condition that increases their risk of severe illness from a coronavirus infection. Such conditions include asthma, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer and physical inactivity, among many others. The authors said that for people between the ages of 6 months and 64 years who don’t have any risk factors for severe COVID, “the FDA anticipates the need for randomized, controlled trial data” to evaluate the benefit of the vaccines before licensing them for younger populations. It’s important to note that the COVID-19 vaccine remains on the child immunization schedule for individuals ages 6 months to 17 years, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that children and their parents can receive the vaccine in consultation with their doctor — a process known as shared decision-making. Days after the journal article was published, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., said on social media that the vaccine would also no longer be recommended for healthy pregnant women, despite pregnancy being a risk factor for severe illness. Doctors familiar with the framework say it’s unclear how changes in the vaccine policy would affect insurance coverage for individuals under the age of 65 who have no risk factors. Typically, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel of independent experts that advises the CDC, recommends how federally approved vaccines should be used. Insurers are required to cover certain vaccines recommended by ACIP and adopted by the CDC. Changes raise questions for adults under 65 Federal data highlights the heightened risks of the coronavirus for adults 65 and older. Since the start of the pandemic, about 77 percent of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in adults 65 and older, data from the CDC shows, and hospitalization rates for this age group are much higher than those for younger populations. Still, roughly 17 percent of COVID deaths have occurred in adults ages 50 to 64, and about 5.5 percent in people ages 30 to 49. Robert H. Hopkins Jr., M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, says the changes could “raise, potentially, additional concerns in the health care professional community about the value of vaccinating people at all who are under 65, if they don't have major health conditions.” What’s more, Hopkins adds, the framework excludes people who want to get the vaccine to reduce their risk of long COVID, which affects more than 20 million Americans. According to the CDC, research shows that COVID vaccination is the best way to prevent long COVID, including in children. “There’s an implication that [the vaccine] is not effective, and we know it’s effective,” says Rebecca Wurtz, M.D., an infectious disease physician and a professor in health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. According to a CDC study, the vaccines averted approximately 68,000 hospitalizations during the 2023–2024 respiratory virus season. Wurtz says the shift could also put more responsibility on patients under 65 to familiarize themselves with all the conditions that can increase their risk of severe illness and communicate those conditions to their doctor, especially since it’s unlikely clinical trial data will be available in time for the fall vaccine season. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “The risk factors [outlined by the CDC] are conditions that many people ages 50 to 65 share,” Wurtz says, pointing to obesity as one and trouble hearing as another. Federal research shows that 28 percent of adults 50 and older are physically inactive — another key risk factor for severe COVID-19. Another concern among some doctors: The change proposed in the New England Journal of Medicine article ignores young children, who are not immune to the effects of COVID-19. According to an analysis of data from the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 234,000 children under age 18 were hospitalized with COVID-19 from the fall of 2020 to the spring of 2024. And children ages 0-4 accounted for 58 percent of the confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions from January 2022 to April 2024, the same analysis found. “We’re not talking about and thinking about that relationship between, you know, teachers and health care providers and grandparents getting COVID and transmitting it to their non-immune grandchildren or patients or students,” Wurtz says. CDC data shows that about 13 percent of U.S. children under the age of 18 got the COVID-19 vaccine in the 2024-2025 respiratory illness season. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Reducing your COVID risk It’s unclear when any outlined changes will take effect. In the meantime, Wurtz says, adults 65 and older who are concerned about getting sick from the virus this summer can get a spring booster, as recommended by the CDC. Individuals who are moderately or severely immunocompromised are also eligible for a spring shot. “We know that immunity wanes over the space of four to six months. And we also know that COVID is a year-round condition, not an influenza-patterned condition,” Wurtz says. “[The vaccine] is safe, it’s effective, it’s covered by insurance, and it’s available at drugstores. And I think people [65 and older] should be reminded to get that booster.” For people under 65 who are not eligible for a spring shot, washing hands often and cleaning frequently touched surfaces can help reduce the risk of getting sick. Opting for outdoor activities over indoor ones and wearing a high-quality mask in public indoor areas can also help. “We have to recognize that COVID-19 is still here with us,” Hopkins says. “It’s still causing thousands of deaths a year. It’s causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations a year. Those numbers are less each year as we come through the pandemic, but as long as the virus continues to circulate, we’re still going to generate new variants.” Editor's note: This story, first published May 21, 2025, has been updated to reflect new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/pneumonia-symptoms-treatments/,"What Is Pneumonia? 5 Warning Signs to Watch For Whether caused by viruses, fungi or bacteria, this lung infection can turn serious — especially in older adults By Michelle Crouch, Updated February 18, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 02, 2021 / Updated February 18, 2025 Getty Images It’s pretty common to develop a cough or an upper respiratory infection in the winter. Most of the time you get over it quickly. But sometimes a winter illness can develop into pneumonia, a lung infection that is particularly dangerous for older adults. In a typical year, about 1.4 million Americans go to the emergency room with pneumonia and more than 41,000 people die of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pneumonia can cause severe illness in people of any age, but children under age 5 and older adults are the most vulnerable. A 2022 National Health Statistics report found about 5 percent of patients aged 18 to 44 died while hospitalized for pneumonia; that share jumped to 11 percent among patients 65 and older. People who smoke, have weak immune systems or suffer from chronic conditions such as lung disease or heart disease are at higher risk for complications from the illness. Pneumonia causes and diagnosis Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses, including the ones that cause the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19. The vast majority of people with pneumonia have bacterial infections, but recent data suggests that viruses cause more cases than doctors previously realized. Bacterial pneumonias tend to be more severe than those caused by viruses. It’s not unusual to develop bacterial pneumonia while your body is fighting a viral infection, says Todd Rice, M.D., professor of medicine and director of the medical intensive care unit at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Pneumonia is diagnosed with a chest X-ray or CT scan. Your doctor may also send your blood and a mucus sample to a lab for a culture to try to determine what type of bacteria or virus is the culprit. 5 pneumonia warning signs and symptoms Pneumonia symptoms can be mild or severe. They tend to be similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer and may get worse over time. Here are some common symptoms. Productive cough. You will be “coughing up lots of nasty stuff,” says Charles Bregier, M.D., an emergency medicine physician and medical director at Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. The sputum often has a yellow, green or gray look. Fever. Fever and chills are signs that your body is fighting the infection. But the absence of a fever doesn’t necessarily rule out pneumonia, especially in those age 65 and older. (See sidebar.) Shortness of breath. You may have trouble catching your breath when walking or talking, or feel like you’re breathing faster than normal. Chest pain. You may experience sharp or stabbing chest pain that hurts more when you take a deep breath or cough.Dizziness or delirium. Some older adults with pneumonia may experience a change in cognition or awareness, says Sarina Sahetya, M.D., a pulmonologist and intensivist at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “If someone comes into the hospital and says their loved one is confused,” she says, “that’s a red flag for us to start looking for infection.” When to call a doctor What to know about pneumonia and body temperature A fever is often associated with pneumonia because the body is fighting an infection, but that’s not always the case in older adults, says Sahetya. Sometimes older adults with pneumonia actually develop a low body temperature — below 97 degrees Fahrenheit, she notes. “It has to do with how your immune system is responding to infection,” she says. “In people who are older, who tend to have weaker immune systems or who are immunosuppressed, instead of getting the immune system revved up, the infection actually can cause low temperatures.” It’s important to reach out to your doctor right away if you suspect pneumonia, especially if the patient is in a higher-risk group. Because dangerous complications can occur, starting treatment early can be critical. If at any time you are experiencing shortness of breath or persistent chest pain, you should seek immediate care by going to the emergency room, Rice says. How to prevent pneumonia How can you protect yourself and your loved ones from pneumonia? Start by taking the same steps you use to protect yourself against other illnesses: wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your nose and mouth, and stay away from those who are coughing and sneezing. To keep your immune system strong, make sure you get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. Getting the influenza, RSV and COVID-19 vaccines will help protect you from pneumonia caused by those viruses. There’s also a vaccine that helps protect against pneumococcal disease, which can lead to pneumococcal pneumonia, the most common type of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. The pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults 50 and older and others with certain health conditions that increase their risk for serious illness.

Sometimes older adults with pneumonia actually develop a low body temperature — below 97 degrees Fahrenheit, she notes. “It has to do with how your immune system is responding to infection,” she says. “In people who are older, who tend to have weaker immune systems or who are immunosuppressed, instead of getting the immune system revved up, the infection actually can cause low temperatures.” ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

According to a new study, it can make you age faster too.﻿ The study, published recently in the journal Science Advances, shows that ongoing exposure to heat over 80 degrees accelerates biological aging, which is how your body ages on the inside at the cellular level, regardless of how many birthdays you’ve had. This might mean, for example, that instead of getting a specific health condition at a certain older age, it happens earlier, says Deborah Carr, director of the Center of Innovation in Social Science at Boston University, who studies heat and aging. “[It] means you [have] more years of suffering, more years of demands on your caregiver,” Carr explains. It also means you may not have Medicare in place to properly care for any premature health problems that arise, she notes. Heat’s impact on the aging process If you’re living in an area with extreme heat for half the year, you could be even more prone to faster aging, the study found. In fact, for people living in hot climates, biological aging sped up nearly three years in some cases. For the study, a team of researchers at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California used different biological clock models to measure markers of aging in blood samples from 3,686 American adults, ages 56 and older. The researchers then compared each individual’s aging outcomes, measured by slight changes in their DNA, with their geographical heat index, considering heat and humidity. Researchers categorized hot days as those that were 80 to 90 degrees, 90 to 103 degrees, and 103 to 124 degrees. They found that people who lived in areas that experienced more days of extreme heat were more likely to see greater increases in their biological age compared with people who experienced fewer hot days. “Participants living in areas where heat days, as defined as Extreme Caution or higher levels [90 degrees and up], occur half the year, such as Phoenix, Arizona, experienced up to 14 months of additional biological aging compared to those living in areas with fewer than 10 heat days per year,” study coauthor Eunyoung Choi said in a statement. “Even after controlling for several factors, we found this association. Just because you live in an area with more heat days, you’re aging faster biologically.” How heat affects your health Biological age varies for everyone because it’s based on how your cells age. Chronological age, meanwhile, refers to how long you’ve been alive. One of the ways s﻿﻿cientists measure biological age is based on methylation — a process that changes DNA. “When you have extreme heat or when you’re exposed to it, it causes stress to your body. That stress can manifest, particularly in your cells, by changes in your DNA,” explains Arnab Ghosh, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine who studies the effects of extreme heat on older adults. It’s not just heat that can affect a person’s biological age, Ghosh says. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking or having a condition like diabetes, can change it too. Some evidence suggests that accelerated biological aging could raise the risk of dementia; it has been linked with other health issues, too, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. Heat can also raise the risk of heart attack and stroke, according to research. Ghosh notes that heat can be harder on some older individuals, including people who take certain medications or have other chronic conditions. Women may also be more susceptible to complications from heat, according to a study published in 2024, which found that women ages 40 to 64 were as vulnerable to the effects of heat as men ages 65-plus. “Whether that [heat-related stress] leads [directly] to problems or aging or advanced aging is still an open question,” Ghosh says. And researchers aren’t sure if heat stress effects are permanent, he adds. Your personal heat baseline Being in 90-plus-degree weather isn’t a standard cutoff for when heat stress begins. Everyone has a different threshold, meaning you can still experience heat stress at 80 degrees, for example. People who live in warmer climates year-round may partly adapt to the heat naturally, but it can be harder during a heat wave. If you live in Arizona, for example, you may have a different baseline than someone who lives in Montana — a phenomenon known as acclimatization, Ghosh says. Everything from your behavior and age to chronic conditions and what you wear can influence your risk for heat stress, Ghosh says, and scientists don’t know the threshold for each person. A 2021 study showed that being in 75.2 degrees continuously without proper cooling can affect your body. “That can really have a significant wear and tear on the body, especially at night,” says Carr. A certain temperature can feel different in various places — it may be cooler near a beach but feel warmer in a city with little breeze, Carr says. Knowing your threshold can get complicated if you spend part of your year in a hotter area and the rest in a cooler climate, she adds. Plus, structures in areas that are warmer year-round likely have air conditioning, but that’s not the case in cooler areas, especially where older homes are common, Carr points out. 5 ways to ward off heat’s harmful health effects You can’t stop the temps from climbing, but there are a few ways to stay safe in the heat — and perhaps ease the heat stress that could make you age faster. 1. Stay alert. Watch the news or stay up to date on advisory warnings so you can adapt what you do, how you hydrate or what you wear, Ghosh says. “As temperatures warm up, people have to be more aware of the environment around them and adjust accordingly,” Ghosh adds. The first heat wave of the season can be the worst on health, he says. 2. Avoid extreme temps. The hottest time of the day is during midday hours— a good time to stay indoors in air conditioning, especially during a heat wave, Ghosh says. If you know you don’t do well in high heat, don’t run errands at the hottest times of the day. As you get older, you may not be able to do things at midday that you could do just a few years ago, Carr explains. “People really need to be mindful about altering their behaviors [when it’s hot],” Carr adds. 3. Watch your meds. Certain medications, such as those for high blood pressure or heart disease, may raise your risk for fainting in high heat. Know if any drugs or supplements you take could make you less tolerant to the heat, Ghosh says. Keep your medications out of the heat too, Carr adds, since exposure to varying temperatures can alter them chemically. 4. Keep cool at night. Sleep in a lower temperature to avoid heat stress — especially if you already have trouble sleeping, Carr says. 5. Plan for the heat. “Have a climate plan just the way you might have a will,” Carr advises. Know where you can go if you need to leave your home or what to do if you don’t have power due to high heat. “That can be really helpful, especially for older people,” Carr says.

Antiviral medications can help keep a mild coronavirus infection from turning severe By Rachel Nania, Updated March 26, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 01, 2023 / Updated March 26, 2025 Getty Images COVID-19 activity is calmer now than it was during the peak of winter, but public health experts warn not to get too complacent. Unlike influenza and other respiratory viruses, the coronavirus hasn’t settled into a seasonal pattern, and in past years, cases have climbed back up during the warmer months. If you find yourself testing positive for COVID this spring or summer, know that there are prescription treatments that can help keep a mild infection from turning severe. “So it’s important that everyone who’s infected and who is in a high-risk status have access to these medications,” says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. As the pandemic subsided, widespread access to free COVID-19 treatments came to an end. Now, patients need to rely on some combination of private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and assistance programs run by drugmakers to help cover the cost of once-free medications, including Paxlovid. Here’s what you need to do if you test positive for COVID-19 and are eligible for time-sensitive treatments. Who will have to pay for COVID treatments? If you have Medicare or Medicaid Medicare prescription drug plans (known as Part D) are required to cover oral antivirals for COVID-19, and out-of-pocket costs, if any, will vary by plan. If Medicare Part D enrollees have trouble obtaining antiviral coverage, they should contact their plan or 1-800-MEDICARE for assistance, a spokesperson from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services tells AARP. Some Medicare enrollees can get Paxlovid for free through a U.S. government patient assistance program operated by the drug’s maker, Pfizer, through Dec. 31, 2025, according to Pfizer’s website. People with Medicaid can also get free Paxlovid through this program. Here’s how it works: Eligible patients with a prescription for Paxlovid can enroll in the assistance program online at paxlovid.iassist.com or over the phone (877-219-7225). Pfizer estimates that the enrollment process takes about five minutes, and it can be done by the patient, a caregiver, a health care provider or a pharmacist at the point of care. The enrollment form will ask for the basics — name, date of birth, address, phone number, etc. You will also need to enter prescriber information and confirm your insurance status, so if someone else is enrolling for you, be sure they have this information. After enrolling, the patient will receive an electronic voucher that can be exchanged for a free course of Paxlovid at participating pharmacies. There isn’t a similar government program in place for Lagevrio, another oral antiviral for COVID-19 that is available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and is a treatment option for people who are unable to take Paxlovid or, if hospitalized, Veklury (remdesivir). What about Veklury?​ Veklury (remdesivir) is another COVID-19 antiviral treatment, but unlike Paxlovid and Lagevrio, it’s not a prescription pill you take at home. The medication is administered through an IV at a medical facility; therefore, it’s covered by Part B for people with Medicare. If you have commercial insurance, coverage and out-of-pocket costs for Veklury will vary by plan. ﻿​ Merck says it offers a Lagevrio patient assistance program for “eligible patients who, without assistance, could not otherwise afford the product.” It takes 10 to 20 minutes to determine a patient’s eligibility for this program; more information is available at merckhelps.com or by calling 800-727-5400. What about Veklury?​ Veklury (remdesivir) is another COVID-19 antiviral treatment, but unlike Paxlovid and Lagevrio, it’s not a prescription pill you take at home. The medication is administered through an IV at a medical facility; therefore, it’s covered by Part B for people with Medicare. If you have commercial insurance, coverage and out-of-pocket costs for Veklury will vary by plan. ﻿​ If you have private insurance You could face out-of-pocket costs for treating COVID-19 if you have private insurance, since Paxlovid and Lagevrio will “be subject to the regular cost-sharing policies” of your health plan, says Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of the Global Health & HIV Policy Program at KFF. In 2023, Pfizer priced Paxlovid at $1,390 for the five-day treatment course. If your plan doesn’t cover Paxlovid or if your out-of-pocket payment is high, you may be eligible to receive assistance through Pfizer’s copay program, which involves an enrollment process that is similar to the government-backed patient assistance program. To enroll in the copay program, visit paxlovid.com/paxcess or call 877-219-7225. Privately insured patients may be eligible for a coupon from Merck to help them save on out-of-pocket costs for Lagevrio. More information is available at lagevrio.com/patients/coupon/. If you don't have insurance You shouldn’t have to pay out of pocket for COVID-19 treatment in the next few years if you’re uninsured. Paxlovid will remain free for people without health insurance and for people who are underinsured through 2028, according to CMS. You’ll need to enroll in the patient assistance program to get the antiviral at no cost. More information is available at paxlovid.iassist.com or by calling 877-219-7225. Similarly, Merck’s patient assistance program is meant to help eligible individuals who can’t otherwise afford the full cost of the medication. More information is available at merckhelps.com or by calling 800-727-5400. Experts urge patients to be proactive Research highlighted by HHS finds that oral antiviral treatments can reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths by as much as tenfold for people at high risk for severe disease. This population includes adults 50 and older and people with underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease and obesity. However, in order for the medications to be effective, they must be started soon after symptoms appear — ideally within five days. Because time is of the essence, Mariana Socal, M.D., associate scientist in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says high-risk patients should talk to their doctor about whether they’re a good candidate for one of the available treatments before they even come down with COVID-19, so there’s a plan in place if they test positive. Find COVID-19 Vaccines in Your State AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Make sure you have coronavirus tests on hand, Socal adds, so if you experience symptoms, you can quickly know whether you’re dealing with COVID. If you have symptoms but test negative for COVID-19, it’s important to still talk to your doctor, Schaffner says. You may have another illness that requires a different course of treatment. “It is common for people to say, ‘Well, I’ll see if I get better tomorrow.’ And so they put things off, and of course, that allows the infection to continue,” Schaffner says. “We ought to overcome that reluctance and contact our providers early rather than later.” Editor's note: This story, first published Nov. 1, 2023, has been updated to include new information.

And for a number of reasons, older adults are more likely to be affected by it. According to national statistics, nearly a quarter of U.S. adults ages 75 and older have heart disease, an umbrella term for a cluster of heart conditions, including coronary artery disease and heart failure. Roughly 14 percent of adults ages 65 to 74 and 9 percent of adults ages 55 to 64 have received a diagnosis. 7 types of heart disease Coronary artery disease — narrowing of your heart’s blood vessels because of fatty deposits Arrhythmias — abnormal heart rhythms Heart valve diseases Cardiomyopathy — abnormal heart muscle Heart failure — heart squeezing and relaxation difficulties Congenital heart disease — heart issues you have at birth Issues with the fluid-filled sac surrounding your heart (pericardium) Source: Cleveland Clinic “Heart disease is unfortunately prevalent,” says Steven Tabak, M.D., medical director of quality and physician outreach at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. “But we can really impact it” if we address its risk factors, he adds. Indeed, even as it becomes more common with age, heart disease is not inevitable. Doctors and researchers say there are several things individuals can do to lower their risk, and while it’s ideal to adopt these changes when you’re young, it’s never too late to start. Here are eight things you need to know about heart disease, including its risks, symptoms and how doctors help to treat it. 1. Leading heart disease risk factors are common among older adults A handful of habits and health conditions can increase a person’s risk of getting heart disease. Chief among them is high cholesterol, which can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, causing them to narrow. High cholesterol — defined as total cholesterol above 200 mg/dL — is most commonly diagnosed in people between ages 40 and 59, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The only way to know your numbers is to have your cholesterol checked with a blood test. High blood pressure, which affects an estimated 63 percent of adults ages 60 and older, is another big risk factor for heart disease. A blood pressure reading of 130–139 for the top number (known as the systolic pressure) and 80–89 for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) is considered high. Other heart disease risk factors include: Diabetes, which affects nearly one in three people ages 65 and olderPhysical inactivityExcess weightAn unhealthy dietAlcohol useSmoking While many heart disease risk factors are modifiable, some are not. In fact, about 50 percent of heart disease risk is genetically determined, according to a 2024 article in the journal Atherosclerosis, which is why knowing your family’s history with the disease is critical. Genetic testing for variants of the TNNT2 gene can help your doctor assess your risk for developing dangerous heart conditions and inform the playbook for your individual health care plan. Abha Khandelwal, M.D., a cardiologist with Stanford Health Care in California, says people who are more susceptible to heart disease can improve their outcomes with heart-healthy behaviors like exercise and controlling blood sugar and blood pressure. 7 types of heart disease Coronary artery disease — narrowing of your heart’s blood vessels because of fatty deposits Arrhythmias — abnormal heart rhythms Heart valve diseases Cardiomyopathy — abnormal heart muscle Heart failure — heart squeezing and relaxation difficulties Congenital heart disease — heart issues you have at birth Issues with the fluid-filled sac surrounding your heart (pericardium) Source: Cleveland Clinic 2. Heart disease can lead to dangerous — and deadly — complications Heart disease can lead to several complications affecting not only the heart but other parts of the body. These include: Arr﻿hythmia — a fast or abnormal heart rateCardiac arrest — when the heart stops beating suddenlyCardiomyopathy — a disease of the heart that makes it harder for the muscle to pump bloodHeart attackHeart failureHeart valve diseasePulmonary hypertension, high blood pressure in your arteries which starves your blood of oxygenKidney damageLiver damage 3. Its symptoms can be sneaky Often called the “silent killer,” heart disease can strike without warning: You might not know you have it until you have a heart attack, stroke or other sudden event. Each year, there are approximately 605,000 heart attacks in the U.S., and 170,000 of them occur without any major symptoms. “We think of heart disease as this sudden, crushing chest pain with an elephant sitting on your chest. And that can be the case for some people, but for a lot of other people, it can be unusual,” says Samuel Kim, M.D., director of preventive cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. According to the Mayo Clinic, common symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels can include shortness of breath, weakness or numbness in the arms and legs, and pain in the neck, jaw, upper back or upper belly. Symptoms of heart disease caused by irregular heartbeats can range from dizziness to shortness of breath to a racing heartbeat. 4. Women have unique risks Khandelwal says heart disease is often assumed to be a man’s disease, but it’s also the leading cause of death among women. In fact, it affects more than 60 million women in the U.S., according to the CDC. Several health issues unique to women play a role in heart disease risk, Khandelwal says, including gestational diabetes, preterm labor, preeclampsia and the years leading up to menopause (called perimenopause) when estrogen levels drop. Estrogen has a protective effect on the heart by increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also called the “good” cholesterol. When women go through menopause, the drop in estrogen puts them at risk for heart disease when HDL levels start to creep up. 5. Some diets are better than others for heart disease Not all diets are created equal when it comes to keeping heart disease in check. The American Heart Association ranks a few at the top, including the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet — a low-sodium plan full of fresh fruits and vegetables and very limited processed foods — and the Mediterranean diet, also rich in plants, fresh fish, legumes, nuts and olive oil. These and a plant-based diet get high marks for lowering the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure, according to a 2023 article published in the Vascular Health and Risk Management journal. The article cited several studies, including one that found that people who ate a diet full of fruits, veggies and legumes reduced their risk of early death by 19 percent. On the flip side, doctors and researchers say there are several foods to avoid if you are trying to lower heart disease risk or manage the condition. These include: Fatty meatsProcessed foodsTropical oils and partially hydrogenated fatsFoods high in sodiumFoods high in added sugar “In place of fatty meats, try leaner cuts of meat such as loin and round cuts, poultry without the skin, fish and seafood, and beans,” says Kelli Metzer, a registered dietitian at GW Medical Faculty Associates in Washington, D.C. “Grilling, baking or air frying are healthier cooking methods than frying in oil﻿,” she adds. 6. Sleep habits can affect your heart Getting fewer than seven hours of sleep a night can increase your risk of developing diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure — all of which influence heart disease risk, the CDC says. Tabak says getting into a regular sleep routine is key to catching more ZZ’s. “People who don’t have a regular time to go to bed or wake up, they’re just setting themselves up for sleep deprivation,” he says. Sleep apnea, a common sleep disorder, can also increase heart disease risk or worsen it if you already have it. If your partner complains of constant snoring, that could be one clue that it’s time to check with your doctor about sleep apnea. Other symptoms include waking up feeling short of breath and excess daytime sleepiness. 7. A little exercise can make a big difference in heart disease risk The CDC recommends you get moving — and a little can go a long way. Aim for 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise, like walking — that’s a 21-minute walk each day. You should also incorporate strength training two times per week. The key, Tabak says, is to “find something that you enjoy doing and will do regularly.” Studies have found that even gardening can lower the risk of heart disease in older adults. 8. Medications can be lifesavers There are several medications doctors prescribe to lower the risk of heart disease or help manage it. Some of them include: Ace inhibitors, which lower blood pressureAspirin, to prevent blood clotsBeta blockers, to lower blood pressure and force the heart to beat with less forceBlood thinnersCalcium channel blockers, to lower blood pressure and relax blood vesselsCholesterol-lowering medicationsDiuretics, to help get rid of sodiumVasodilators, to lower blood pressure by widening blood vessels for better blood flow For several years now, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists — or GLP-1s, like Ozempic and Wegovy — have helped people with diabetes and obesity lose weight and lower blood glucose levels. More recently, some have been federally approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in individuals who are overweight or have obesity. “I think they [GLP-1s] have a role in reducing heart disease,” Khandelwal, says, though she cautions they may have some drawbacks, especially for older adults. “There is some evidence that when we lose weight with some of these medications, we also risk losing skeletal muscle,” she explains.

You cut calories. You cut fat. Basically, anything that’s crammed with carbs, sweetened with sugar or dipped in a deep fryer is suddenly off-limits. But dieting doesn’t have to require deprivation. Many delicious (and healthy) foods can still be part of your dining repertoire. When it comes to diet, the aim is not “How low can you go?” Your body needs calories for energy. Try to focus less on the numbers and more on the overall quality of your diet. “Lean into whole foods and away from processed foods as much as you can,” suggests Katie Sanger, an integrative and functional registered dietitian in Boulder, Colorado. If you are going to indulge, the one food group that you can eat lots of without suffering the consequences of weight gain are non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, celery, zucchini and bell pepper, says Lona Sandon, a clinical nutrition expert at UT Southwestern Medical Center. “Non-starchy vegetables are the best ones to over-consume, because they’re so much lower in calories than other food choices,” she says. Even with vegetables, resist the temptation to go hog wild on any one food. Eat nothing but carrots, and you’ll have an overabundance of beta-carotene at the expense of other nutrients (your skin might even turn orange). Variety is the secret spice to any weight-loss diet. “When we focus on just one food, we are getting very minimal nutrients,” Sanger says. “Everything in moderation.” When making changes to your diet, you don’t need to go it alone. It’s preferable to get some help from your primary care doctor or a dietitian. Your doctor can check your vitamin and cholesterol levels to make sure you safely embark on your new way of eating. A dietitian can assess your needs and create a meal plan that’s not only tailored to your goals but also sustainable over the long term. Mix and match these 25 foods to your heart’s content as part of an overall well-balanced diet. 1. Berries Make berries your go-to cereal topper or dessert and start reaping the myriad health benefits. Pick any type of berry — strawberries, blackberries, raspberries or blueberries. All are low in calories and rich in nutrients like fiber, vitamin C, folate and potassium. The natural plant pigments that give these fruits their vibrant colors have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that might protect against heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Blueberries are rich in a flavonoid called anthocyanin that can help boost the immune system. Unlike other fruits, berries are relatively low in sugar. “You want to be mindful of how much sugar you’re consuming, even if it is from fruit,” Sanger says. Berries are low on the glycemic index, so they won’t spike your blood sugar, and you’ll digest them slowly. That’s important when weight loss is the goal. 2. Chickpeas Chickpeas, also called garbanzo beans, are a member of the legume family (which also includes beans, peas and lentils). You’re most likely to find them in hummus, a Middle Eastern spread made from mashed chickpeas blended with olive oil, tahini, lemon juice and spices. They also make an excellent salad topper. Some moderation is advised, because chickpeas are higher in calories (120 per ½ cup serving) and carbs (20 grams per serving) than many of the other foods listed here. Yet their nutrient-dense design still makes them a worthy addition to this list. “Chickpeas are very fiber-rich, and they’re a good source of protein,” Sanger says. The humble chickpea is also a good source of potassium, calcium and vitamin A, and research suggests they might help with weight management and heart disease prevention. To make your own, try this recipe for very green pea hummus. 3. Mushrooms The mushroom family is enjoying a renaissance. In 2022, The New York Times named this edible fungus “ingredient of the year.” It’s no wonder, since mushrooms make a lower-fat and lower-calorie stand-in for meat in recipes. “They don’t have the protein and the same level of B vitamins that meat has, but they have that chewy texture, which makes it easy to put them into a dish and reduce some of the meat,” says Sandon. Because of the way mushrooms grow in the ground, they absorb a lot of nutrients, which vary depending on the type — and there are a lot of varieties to choose from. Cremini and portabella mushrooms are high in selenium, while shiitake mushrooms are a good source of vitamin B6. ﻿4. Celery Don’t relegate celery to the veggie tray. This versatile vegetable is so much more than a cocktail party hors d’oeuvre. For a mere 6 calories per stalk, it offers fiber, plus nutrients like potassium, vitamin A and lutein, along with a satisfying crunch. Another benefit? Celery is 95 percent water, with nearly one half-cup in each serving. The combo of water plus fiber fills your belly quickly, which prevents you from overeating, Sanger says. If you find this simple veggie too plain on its own, add a thin layer of hummus (see chickpeas, above) or add flavor with some lemon juice or chives.﻿ Popcorn is packed with fiber and whole grains, but be sure to limit yourself to three cups. Sam Island 5. Popcorn If you’re looking for the perfect low-cal snack, you’ve found it. Each crunchy bite of popcorn is filled with fiber and whole grains. With a mere 30 calories per cup, you can chow down on large quantities with zero guilt. One big caveat is to be careful of how you prep your popcorn. Popping it in oil and drowning it in butter and salt will override the health benefits (a tub of movie theater buttered popcorn can contain more than 1,000 calories and 2,650 milligrams of sodium). Instead, air-pop it and drizzle on a little olive oil or avocado oil, with just a pinch of sea salt for flavoring, Sanger suggests. Try to limit yourself to three cups, which is still a hefty portion of popcorn. 6. Grapefruit You might remember the grapefruit diet, a fad favored by celebrities in the 1970s. Eat grapefruit with every meal and the weight will melt off — or so proponents claimed. While grapefruit isn’t a magical fat-burning food, adding it to your diet (in moderation) isn’t a bad idea if you’re trying to lose weight. Because this fruit is 88 percent water, it should fill you up faster, so you’ll eat less. Just don’t load it up with sugar to make it taste sweeter. One precaution is to make sure it doesn’t interact with your medications. “Grapefruit or grapefruit juice can interfere with some types of blood pressure medications and cholesterol-lowering medications,” Sandon says. Ask your doctor or pharmacist whether this fruit is safe to eat with your current meds Popcorn is packed with fiber and whole grains, but be sure to limit yourself to three cups. Sam Island 7. Spinach It’s hard to find a food healthier than spinach. For just 40 calories a cup, it offers protein, folate, vitamin A and more than 400 percent of your daily requirement of vitamin K — a nutrient that’s essential for blood clotting and bone strengthening. The high potassium and magnesium content can help regulate blood pressure, and the fiber fills you up. Plus, it can help keep your gastrointestinal tract moving smoothly to prevent constipation. If you’re not enamored with spinach, the flavor is easily hidden in smoothies and casseroles. 8. Cottage cheese The vitamin D and calcium in dairy foods are essential components of strong bones and teeth. One easy way to meet your recommended daily allowance of these nutrients is to incorporate a serving of cottage cheese into your meals and snacks. The 2 percent variety is low in calories (91 per 4-ounce serving) but packed with protein and nutrients like phosphorus and potassium. Cottage cheese is unique in that the type of protein it contains, casein, digests slowly to help curb appetite, Sandon says. 9. Cauliflower When it comes to cruciferous vegetables, broccoli might get more attention, but cauliflower also deserves an honorable mention. It’s versatile and mild flavored enough to serve as a low-calorie (just 27 per cup) substitute for rice, mashed potatoes and pizza crust, which makes it a darling of the low-carb crowd. Proving that vegetables don’t need to be green to be nutritious, cauliflower is loaded with fiber, folate and vitamins C and K. ﻿ Carrots are a good source of vitamins A and K, as well as potassium and fiber — all for just 25 calories per medium-sized carrot. Sam Island 10. Carrots Eye doctors are big fans of this root vegetable, and for good reason. Carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A, which is essential for sharp vision. But there’s much more to these orange veggies than meets the eye. They’re also a good source of vitamin K, as well as potassium and fiber, all for a mere 25 calories per medium-sized carrot. 11. Oatmeal One cup of oatmeal contains four grams of fiber, but it’s not just any fiber. Beta-glucan is soluble fiber. When it mixes with water, it thickens and fills your belly, which wards off the late-morning hungries. Another beta-glucan perk is its ability to lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. As with popcorn, the right preparation is key. “If you’re putting on a pat of butter, brown sugar and a splash of whipping cream, that definitely negates the benefit,” Sandon says. She recommends making your oatmeal with low-fat milk for extra calcium and protein. Then top it with fresh berries to add nutrients without piling on more calories. 12. Black beans We chose black beans to represent the bean category, but really any variety — kidney, navy, lima or pinto — will work. Because black beans are legumes, they’re higher in calories (115 per ½ cup) and carbs (20 grams) than non-starchy vegetables, but with 8 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein per serving, they’ll really fill you up. “Beans can actually be substituted for meat because of their protein,” Sandon says. And thanks to their soluble fiber, beans are also helpful for reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels. 13. Lettuce Buried under a mound of salad toppings as it often is, lettuce is easy to overlook. But this leafy green is worthy of your attention. You can chow down on two entire cups of lettuce and still consume less than 16 calories. Skip the iceberg, which is also light in nutrients. Romaine and watercress have a similarly low calorie count, but they’re rich in vitamins A and K, as well as potassium. Because drowning your salad in dressing will add back all the calories you were trying to avoid, sprinkle on some lemon juice or olive oil and vinegar instead. 14. Pomegranate This bright red fruit has been part of the human diet for thousands of years — the seeds are an important part of the Greek myth of Persephone — but only recently have scientists discovered its full health potential. Pomegranates contain plant-protecting chemicals called polyphenols that also protect humans. These fruits have antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties, and they’re an excellent source of folate, potassium and vitamin K. Reaching the sweet and tart seeds can take some effort, but that’s a plus considering that an entire medium-sized pomegranate contains 234 calories. You’ll conserve calories if you save half for later. Broccoli is less than 30 calories per cup, so you can eat as much of this veggie as you'd like. Sam Island 15. Broccoli We’ve already established that the cruciferous vegetable family is filled with nutritional superstars, and broccoli is no exception. Its benefits are too numerous to list here, but some of the highlights are antioxidants like vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, which may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The high fiber content promotes fullness and keeps your digestive system running smoothly, while the anti-inflammatory properties are a plus for your heart and blood vessels. With less than 30 calories per cup of broccoli, you could feast on this veggie to your heart’s content without gaining weight. However, overindulgence does have a downside. “If you try to sit down and eat two pounds of broccoli…there might be some unpleasant GI side effects,” Sandon says. 16. Salmon This fatty fish has more than earned its title of “superfood.” It has just about everything in the nutrient department — including protein, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, potassium and vitamin A — all for a slim 130 calories per 3-ounce serving. Salmon is perhaps most notable for its omega-3 fatty acids, healthy fats that protect vision and lower the risk for heart disease. You might have seen the debate about farm-raised or wild-caught salmon and wondered which one to buy. Although farm-raised salmon tends to have more omega-3s, it could expose you to higher levels of pollutants and other contaminants. For a delicious way to prepare it, try Al Roker's salmon rice bowl recipe. Carrots are a good source of vitamins A and K, as well as potassium and fiber — all for just 25 calories per medium-sized carrot. Sam Island Broccoli is less than 30 calories per cup, so you can eat as much of this veggie as you'd like. Sam Island 17. Orange It’s easy to understand the orange’s appeal. This sunshine fruit provides a full day’s worth of vitamin C, plus fiber and protective antioxidants — all for around 65 calories. The high fiber and water content make oranges surprisingly filling. Like most other fruits, oranges are much healthier served on a plate than in a glass. “Essentially with fruit juice the fiber is removed, so you’re just getting a cup of sugar with some nutrients in it,” Sanger says. In other words, orange juice isn’t the ideal drink option if weight loss is your goal. Choose the whole orange instead. 18. Tofu This meat alternative is no longer just for vegetarians. Omnivores are also jumping on the tofu bandwagon. You can’t get much more versatile than this soybean-based food, since it assumes the flavor of whatever marinade or sauce you soak it in. Tofu contains 10 grams of protein, without all the saturated fat and cholesterol of red meat. Like other soy products, it’s rich in plant-based chemicals called flavonoids, which help to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk for heart disease and certain cancers. All that, and a ¾ cup serving contains just 100 calories. 19. Kale Kale is another entry that’s earned its rightful place among the pantheon of “superfoods.” People in the eastern Mediterranean region first cultivated kale thousands of years ago, but only in the last decade has it become a culinary trend in the United States. Its impressive nutritional credentials (calcium, potassium, vitamins A, B6, C and K, and folate), low calorie count (less than 35 per cup), and peppery flavor make this cruciferous veggie a favorite of chefs and dietitians alike. And like spinach, kale is versatile enough to blend into smoothies, roast into snack chips, or wilt into soups and stews. One large hard-boiled egg has 78 calories, but with those calories you get 6 grams of protein, along with nutrients like calcium, B vitamins, iron, lutein, zeaxanthin, selenium and choline. Sam Island 20. Eggs The much-maligned egg has taken a beating in the nutritional ring, but public opinion seems to be turning in its favor. One large hard-boiled egg has 78 calories, but with those calories you get 6 grams of protein, along with nutrients like calcium, B vitamins, iron, lutein, zeaxanthin, selenium and choline. While much of the controversy has centered on the cholesterol content of the yolk, the dietitians we spoke with don’t suggest ditching this nutritional powerhouse. “We usually recommend eating the entire egg,” Sanger says. “The yolk is where most of the nutrients in an egg are concentrated.” To avoid adding extra fat and calories, serve your eggs hard boiled or poached or rather than scrambled with butter or fried, and definitely leave off the bacon. 21. Tomato The tomato’s rich red hue isn’t just for show. The color comes from a plant pigment called lycopene, which also infuses these fruits (yes, tomatoes are fruits) with protective antioxidants. Studies have linked tomatoes with a reduced risk for heart disease, and for cancers of the lung, prostate and stomach. One medium-sized tomato has plenty of fiber, vitamins C and K, potassium and folate, and eating the entire thing will add just 23 calories to your daily tally. While some fruits and vegetables are healthier when consumed raw, cooking tomatoes boosts their lycopene content. 22. Brown rice cakes Who says you can’t snack when you’re trying to lose weight? You can if you substitute brown rice cakes for your usual crackers or snack chips. At 34 calories and less than 1 gram of fat per rice cake, it’s a satisfying treat that won’t compromise your diet goals. Brown rice has a definite advantage over white rice because it hasn’t been stripped of the bran and germ, where most of the nutrients are concentrated. As a result, it’s higher in fiber, potassium, iron, magnesium and some B vitamins. Rice cakes can be a little plain on their own, so Sandon suggests pairing them with a piece of low-fat cheese or some nut butter, which will also add protein. 23. Skinless chicken breast Chicken is another good-for-you protein source, but which part of the bird you eat and how you prepare it matters. Skinless chicken breasts are the best choice, with just 140 calories, 3 grams of total fat and 1 gram of saturated fat per 3-ounce serving. The same portion size of dark meat from a thigh or drumstick contains 170 calories, 9 grams of total fat and 3 grams of saturated fat. Regardless of whether you choose dark or light meat, coating it in flour and deep frying it will dramatically increase the fat and calories. Grill, roast or bake your chicken instead, removing the skin and adding olive oil and seasonings like rosemary, garlic powder or smoked paprika to ramp up the flavor. 24. Greek yogurt Yogurt has a lot going for it. It’s an excellent source of bone-building calcium and vitamin D, as well as gut-friendly bacteria called probiotics. Ounce for ounce, the protein count is on par with meat. Greek yogurt has the edge over its American counterpart, with almost twice the protein (21 vs. 13 grams per cup), as well as less sugar and fewer carbs. Sanger recommends choosing unsweetened Greek yogurt and sweetening it yourself with fruit or a little bit of honey. 25. Cucumber Few foods are cooler than the cucumber. Though this crudité has just 8 calories per half-cup serving, it’s no lightweight. Cucumbers contain a decent amount of fiber, calcium, potassium and vitamins A and K. Because cucumbers are 96 percent water, tossing a few slices onto your salad or sandwich can also help you achieve your daily fluid goals, and keep you filled up. Can foods have ‘negative’ calories? Some fruits and veggies, notably celery, grapefruit and cucumber, have been touted as “negative-calorie foods.” The premise is that these foods are so low in calories that the very act of chewing and digesting them burns more calories than the foods contain. It might seem a logical assumption. After all, celery is mostly water, and a whole stalk contains around 6 calories. For a while, drinking celery juice on an empty stomach was all the rage with dieters. But what limited research exists on the subject has pretty much debunked the negative-calorie claim. Researchers tested out the negative-calorie hypothesis by feeding celery to humans, as well as to bearded dragon lizards, and in most cases, it was a bust. Bottom line: Celery certainly won’t make you gain weight, but it won’t take weight off, either. One large hard-boiled egg has 78 calories, but with those calories you get 6 grams of protein, along with nutrients like calcium, B vitamins, iron, lutein, zeaxanthin, selenium and choline.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2023/how-to-get-more-energy.html,"25 Great Ways to Turboboost Your Energy Natural ways to have more energy and fight fatigue By Martin J. Kernan, AARP Reviewed by Stanley Sack, M.D. Comments Published February 05, 2025 Sam Island Our stamina levels may be a little lower than they used to be. But it’s important not to assume that low energy is the norm for older adults. That can lead us down a slippery slope: When you feel tired, you may move less, get out of the house less, socialize less — all bad for your mental and physical well-being. And weariness or a lack of energy for a long period may be worth a conversation with your health care provider, since chronic fatigue can be a sign that something is wrong with your body. We talked to physicians and other health experts about the best ways for older adults to fight fatigue, and compiled a list of 25 science-based tips worth trying. 1. Hug for at least 10 seconds — consensually, please The warmth and fuzzies you feel hugging someone is actually oxytocin, often called the “love hormone,” coursing through your system. The calming effect boosts energy by reducing stress, which gives us a chance to recharge. “I don’t think we touch enough in our culture; some type of healthy, mutually consenting touch is very good for reducing stress, and therefore it’s going to help your energy,” says Shera Raisen, M.D., a physician of integrative medicine in New York City. If there’s no one nearby and willing, try hugging your pet. No pet? Studies show that self-soothing touch, like placing a hand on your heart, offers similar benefits. 2. Drink a glass of warm water Water is essential to every cell in your body. It regulates the body temperature, transports nutrients, assists in removing waste products and more. Naturally then, water has a powerful impact on how we feel. Starting the day with a tall glass is an easy way to avoid feeling sluggish later. Lukewarm water “can increase the metabolic rate, make you feel more relaxed and ready to start your day,” says Jaya Sanghavi, M.D., a physician at the Medical Nutrition Therapy Clinic in Maryland. “It can promote the body’s natural detoxification process, improve circulation throughout the body, stimulate digestion and can prevent constipation, promoting regular bowel movements.” 3. Try a cold shower or ice bath The shock of cold-water immersion can take your breath away, but it can also be invigorating. ﻿Cold-water exposure increases norepinephrine — an energizing brain chemical that increases alertness, arousal and attention, according to a 2022 research review. Cold water also causes blood vessels to constrict and blood to move to the core organs, where it becomes oxygen- and nutrient-rich. As the body warms up, that oxygen-rich blood flows back to the rest of the body, helping to reduce inflammation. However, if you have a heart condition, this one isn’t for you. ﻿4. Kick-start your metabolism with breakfast While a hearty breakfast won’t provide the same jolt as an icy plunge, this first and “most important meal of the day” kick-starts your metabolism. It becomes even more important for maintaining energy levels as we age, Sanghavi says. “Starting the day with a nutritious breakfast helps regulate appetite and reduce hunger later in the day, which can prevent overeating. It can help regulate blood sugar, provide overall energy and improve cognitive function,” she says. Try to get some of these important calories from protein. Refaat Hegazi, M.D., a nutrition specialist at Abbott Laboratories in Ohio, says protein needs can double with age, and research from Abbott and The Ohio State University revealed that more than one in three Americans over 50 aren’t getting enough. An easy rule of thumb for older adults is to aim for 25 to 30 grams of protein per meal, Hegazi says. “Try to include protein-rich foods like poultry, fish, dairy, soy foods, nuts and legumes at all eating occasions.” Basking in morning rays can boost your mood. Sam Island 5. Soak up the morning sun Basking in direct sunlight for 20 to 30 minutes first thing in the morning tells the brain to wake up and sets our internal clock. Morning rays can also boost mood by giving you a big dose of vitamin D, which helps the body make serotonin, also known as the “happy hormone.” For people living in places without a lot of sunlight, a light box is an excellent alternative, Raisen says. “Sit with it in front of you, pretty close, while you’re … reading or doing a meditation or just doodling or looking at your to-do list.” 6. Eat fiber-rich foods Foods rich in fiber are slow-burning fuel sources that sustain energy over long periods. New York-based gastroenterologist Divya Mallam, M.D., recommends 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber — about six to eight﻿ servings of fruits, vegetables and whole grains (brown rice, oatmeal, etc.) daily. And try to avoid “processed foods such as cereals, dessert and cakes, which are digested quickly and can cause blood sugar levels to spike and then quickly fall, leading to lower energy levels, or what is known as ‘food coma,’” she says. ﻿﻿7. Have a coffee, or two Without the dopamine-driven good mood and feeling of alertness provided by a morning cup of joe, many of us would struggle to get going. So, enjoy the burst of energy it provides. But caffeine affects people differently, so if you get a bit jittery after that third cup, for example, it could be a sign you’re over-caffeinated. The solution: Set a limit on the number of caffeinated beverages you drink in a day. Daily intake of more than 400 milligrams of caffeine — about four cups of coffee — is probably too much. Bonus tip: While some see energy drinks as an option for a quick boost of caffeine, with all the sugar and stimulants they contain, they’re probably not the best choice for a pick-me-up. Basking in morning rays can boost your mood. Sam Island ﻿8. Get moving — any way you can The many benefits of working out are widely known. It elevates mood and relieves stress. More oxygen flows to muscles and the brain. It’s good for cardiovascular health; good for bone and muscle health; and good for mental health. But one of the most remarkable ways exercising boosts our energy is by increasing the number of mitochondria within muscle cells. With more of these powerhouse organelles at work, the body can produce energy more efficiently. With all the different forms of exercise out there, from aqua-jogging to Zumba and everything in between, there is likely one for you. “Even if you are in a wheelchair or compromised due to health issues, I always tell my patients to make sure to move. You can ‘fidget’ with your upper body or your legs while sitting. Anything to get the body moving,” says Reed Berger, M.D., medical director of Obesity Programs at the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Medicine. “The great thing about exercise is that the benefit comes right away, almost when you start doing it, and it doesn’t have to be a lot, it doesn’t have to be running or anything too intense. Whatever exercise you’ll do is the best exercise,” says Harold Fain, M.D., an occupational health and family medicine physician at the Acclaim health group in Fort Worth, Texas. ﻿9. Go for a helper’s high Acts of kindness make us feel good, but why? Apparently, many (if not most) of us are hard-wired for empathy. Even a little bit of selflessness can activate the pleasure and reward centers in the brain, leading to feelings of satisfaction and well-being and giving you a “helper’s high” that can increase your overall energy and boost your mood. Even as our bodies age, we can keep our minds young by practicing kindness, says Kaushal Nanavati, M.D. assistant dean of wellness at State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. He recommends doing the simple things, such as “acknowledging somebody’s presence, appreciating something that somebody does for you, offering something without an expectation of getting something back — like a smile. It’s not about doing more, it’s about being present, and when we are, not only does our mindset shift, but what happens is we also start to shift the biochemistry within our body.” Being in nature awakens our body and mind, rewarding us with hits of dopamine and serotonin. Sam Island 10. Hug that tree Being in nature, whether it’s for a 10-mile hike or a stroll in the park, does something extraordinary to many of us. Almost immediately, our senses come alive with the sights, sounds and scents of the natural world. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol drop, and in as little as 20 minutes, calm sets in. Blood pressure settles down. Muscle tensions ease. Our body and awakened mind reward us with hits of dopamine and serotonin as an incentive to do it again soon. 11. Just say 'no' Saying “no” can be a form of kindness — to yourself. It’s an act of self﻿-care that will free you to focus on what really matters, rather than being overloaded with stressful, energy-draining obligations. By setting limits, you protect and conserve your mental energy. “Don’t be afraid to be true to yourself and say no when you feel overwhelmed in life. This goes for work, home, social obligations,” Berger says. 12. Take a whiff of peppermint oil Inhale it, apply it to the skin as oil or drink it as a tea. Chewing a minty stick of gum may work, too. Smelling this powerful herb may stimulate brain areas responsible for alertness and focus. Peppermint’s active ingredient, menthol, is a natural stimulant that can make us feel more awake and energized. A few small studies suggest that peppermint’s refreshing effect enhances physical and cognitive performance, including memory and problem-solving abilities. 13. Be a friend Feeling loved, supported and connected to others can improve mood, reduce stress and give you a sense of belonging, ultimately leading to increased energy levels and motivation. “The only way to have a friend is to be one,” Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote. Sage advice from an esteemed poet and philosopher, though exactly how one is supposed to go about forging social connections isn’t always obvious. Fain has a few suggestions: “If you lean toward the spiritual, get into a faith-based organization.” If not, what do you like to do? Do you like to knit? Do you like to listen to music? Join an organization. There are walking clubs, biking clubs, all kinds of organizations. “Or you can invite your neighbors over for pie or coffee. Just sit there and do nothing except talk for an hour.” 14. Get (a bit) fired up Research by psychologist Jennifer Lerner at the Harvard Kennedy School explores the energizing effect of a little anger. “When anger is moderate and directed at the right source, then you can capitalize on that energy-boosting exhilarating feeling when you think about the future and how to address an injustice,” she says. Using a technique called cognitive appraisal, people can harness their discontent to do something about a problem after they’ve identified its external source. By way of example, “let’s say you lose a pet, and that pet never had great health, because the pet was malnourished before it made its way into a shelter. Then, you found your injustice, and you turn that into your cause. You’re going to do something to redress the bad thing that happened.” Get in the habit of taking short naps — about 20 minutes — to feel refreshed. Sam Island 1﻿5. Power up with a power nap A midday nap, particularly a short “power nap” of around 20 minutes, boosts your energy by allowing your brain to briefly enter a lighter sleep stage. Any longer and you’ll enter deeper sleep, which may leave you waking up feeling groggy. “Shorter naps are better, because they don’t screw up your circadian rhythm,” Raisen says. Her father was a serial napper. For many years as a research chemist, he would close his office door after lunch, put his head on the desk and snooze. He’s 9﻿6 now and still living in his own home. She attributes much of his current mental acuity to napping. “As a culture, we underrate the value of naps for the pre-retirement and retirement age groups,” she says. ﻿ 16. Rest with yoga nidra or meditation Mindfulness practices are becoming more mainstream, and for good reason. They help us manage anxiety-provoking thoughts that sap energy and distract focus. Techniques such as non-sleep deep rest, meditation and yoga nidra use controlled breathing and focused attention to reduce stress and lower heart rate. The deeper mind-body connection that results gives people a feeling of relaxation and mental rejuvenation, Raisen says. Basically, these practices give your brain a mini-rest. When she has an exhausting day and can’t return home and go to sleep, Raisen lies down on a yoga mat and does a 10-, 15- or 30-minute guided yoga nidra. “I wake up so refreshed,” she says. “It’s so powerful.” Being in nature awakens our body and mind, rewarding us with hits of dopamine and serotonin. Sam Island Get in the habit of taking short naps — about 20 minutes — to feel refreshed. Sam Island 17. Embrace the good stress Pay attention to what excites you, because it can be a source of immense energy. The big sales presentation, a first date, your club’s tennis tournament — the intense feelings that can come with such events are examples of good stress, also called eustress, which triggers the body’s “fight or flight” response. Your heart races. Hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge. Blood pressure and glucose levels elevate. You are focused, alert and ready for action. Good stress inspires and motivates you, and even enhances immunity and cell repair, Nanavati says. “Eustress is like a controlled flame versus a raging fire. You can do a lot of good with the right amount of heat, but if it’s out of control, then things burn up.” 18. Enjoy the power of sexual intimacy Sex can release a trifecta of “feel-good” hormones in the brain: endorphins (natural pain relievers with mood-boosting effects), oxytocin (associated with bonding and relaxation) and dopamine (lights up the brain’s reward centers). Arousal can also trigger a small adrenaline rush, contributing to feelings of excitement and energy. In the body, muscles and tendons stretch, and joints flex. Respiration, heart rate and blood pressure increase, which in a healthy person can be energizing. ﻿ 19. Eat the rainbow Even though energy levels are felt in the brain, they often begin in the belly. Bacteria help break down the food we eat, so it’s good to have a lot of different kinds living in our gut. We encourage a diverse microbiome, as it’s called, by eating the rainbow, which means consuming a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. A wide range of nutrients and fiber helps healthy digestion by improving the body’s ability to absorb essential vitamins and minerals from food. When our diets fall short of nutritional excellence, or certain ailments cause nutrient deficiencies, fatigue and weakness can set in. The B vitamins help cells produce energy. Iron, magnesium and vitamin D also directly impact energy production. Your health﻿ care provider can help determine if you need a vitamin or mineral supplement. Put your phone and tablet away before bed and grab a book instead. Sam Island 20. Before bed, curl up with a book and ditch your devices Limiting screen time in the hours before bed allows your body to naturally produce melatonin, the sleep hormone. The blue light emitted from a cellphone, tablet or laptop screen suppresses this hormone, sabotaging your sleep. It’s recommended that you put your devices away at least an hour before bed. 2﻿1. Take a passeggiata The Mediterranean diet isn’t the only health-promoting thing to come out of Italy. In the after-dinner hours, couples, friends and whole families take to the piazzas and streets for a leisurely stroll together known as a passeggiata. Eustachio D’Angelo, 82, grew up in Tocco da Casauria, a small town in central Italy where, he says, “people have always enjoyed going out for a walk in the evening. I don’t think they do it because it’s a healthy thing. They like to see each other.” Still, the health benefits are numerous. This nightly ritual burns calories, improves blood sugar regulation, enhances fat metabolism, improves digestion, reduces bloating, improves circulation and lowers blood pressure. All that, plus, if you’re lucky, someone might treat you to gelato. 2﻿2. Avoid alcohol, especially before bed At dinner, maybe go easy on the vino if you really want to maximize your energy levels. ﻿ One big way avoiding alcohol boosts energy is by improving sleep quality. That super-relaxing nightcap (or two) disrupts sleep cycles, particularly the restorative REM sleep. Without adequate REM sleep, people feel less rested and more fatigued when they wake up. Alcohol also dehydrates the body, suppressing energy levels the next day. And older adults don’t process alcohol as well as they may have at younger ages. Better to find other ways to relax into the evening. For example… 23. Get a good night’s sleep Though it’s much easier said than done, sound, restorative sleep is hands down the most effective yet elusive tool for generating the energy we need to carry us through the day. In deep-sleep stages, the body repairs tissues and refills energy stores, essentially rebooting the body and brain so that you wake up feeling renewed. This process is particularly important for replenishing glycogen, the brain’s primary energy source, which is drawn down when we’re awake. Sun exposure early in the day, eating right and exercising, plus avoiding caffeine or alcohol in the hours before bedtime, will keep your body’s internal clock, the circadian rhythm and sleep schedule in sync. Bonus tip to avoid restless nights: make sure the room is dark, quiet and cool. 24. Shed a few pounds Avoiding refined carbohydrates, sugars and artificial sweeteners — plus getting exercise and good sleep — may provide the added benefit of losing a little weight. Any extra pounds you may be carrying around can be tiring and strain your heart. A lighter you will use less energy and probably go about the day experiencing fewer aches and pains. Overweight people are at higher risk for sleep apnea, a condition that makes it hard to breathe and compromises your sleep quality. Berger says older adults who lose weight in a healthy way “will notice increased energy due to less joint pain and overall improvements in exercise tolerance. They’re often able to do more with their friends and family as well, so it helps with their mental well-being, too.” 25. Talk to your doctor If lifestyle changes don’t fix your fatigue, maybe the problem isn’t something you’re doing, or not doing. Some medications can cause drowsiness or fatigue as a side effect. The common culprits are antidepressants, antihistamines, beta-blockers, muscle relaxants, opioids, benzodiazepines and some blood pressure medications, all of which can impact your central nervous system and make you tired. There’s also the possibility that an underlying medical condition might be causing low energy, such as anemia, thyroid issues and sleep disorders. Your doctor should also be able to provide further guidance on lifestyle changes like diet, exercise and stress management. Put your phone and tablet away before bed and grab a book instead.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/elderberry-for-cold-and-flu/,"Can Elderberry Cure Your Cold Symptoms? The supplements are marketed as an immune-boosting remedy, but like all pills and potions, can come with risks for some By Kimberly Goad, AARP Comments En español Published February 19, 2025 Getty Images You’re laid low by a fever, chills, runny nose, congestion. Can elderberry deliver relief? Thanks to what are believed to be the herbal supplement’s immune-boosting superpowers (the tiny purple berry is loaded with vitamins and antioxidants), elderberry is having something of a moment. A growing number of people are reaching for elderberry juice, syrup, gummies, capsules, tea and tablets to help them power their way through a cold or the flu, while others are simply looking to reap the perceived health benefits. All, despite the fact that high-quality research into whether elderberry actually helps prevent and treat common respiratory infections is lacking, and the small studies that do exist are far from conclusive. Complicating matters, elderberry supplements — like all herbal supplements — are not subjected to the same rigorous testing, manufacturing and labeling standards as prescription and over-the-counter medications. For example, the label on an herbal supplement can include broad promises about the product’s impact on the body — that it “reduces stress” or “promotes digestive comfort.” And unlike highly scrutinized prescription and over-the-counter medications, standardization with supplements is lacking. “Unlike with pharmaceutical drugs, there’s no requirement that botanicals need to be prepared in any standardized way,” says Pieter Cohen, M.D., an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who studies supplement safety. “What we’ve found when we analyze botanical supplements is that the amount of active compound varies widely from one brand to another. So when you go to the store and buy elderberry, you have no idea what you’re getting.” What is elderberry? According to The Plant Humanities Lab, the dark violet-black berry’s beginning as a go-to for colds and flu dates back to 400 B.C. That’s when Hippocrates — the Greek physician known as the “father of medicine” — called the elder plant his “medicine chest” because of the many health woes it seemed to treat — from constipation to hemorrhoids to insect bites and upper respiratory infections. Although there are a number of elderberry varieties, it’s the black elderberry (Sambucus nigra) that’s believed to possess the most immune-boosting bona fides. It’s among the richest sources of plant compounds known as polyphenols, specifically anthocyanins, which have been shown to help immune function. Supplements aren’t without risks, side effects When people are considering any health intervention, they should take two things into account, says Mary L. Hardy, M.D., a botanical medicine and integrative medicine expert with the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine. “The first is safety, and a close second is efficacy. Is it safe, and does it work?” Apart from the big caveat with elderberry — when eaten raw, the berries can be poisonous and make you sick — “it has a good safety record,” says Hardy, citing a review of studies published in 2021 in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies. Although the researchers found that the evidence for effectiveness was mixed, they concluded that the herb appeared to be a safe option for soothing upper respiratory symptoms. It’s easy to assume that anything as ubiquitous as elderberry — supplements are sold online and on store shelves — isn’t capable of doing serious harm. But doctors and public health professionals caution that’s not true, especially for people with chronic conditions. “Elderberry may overstimulate the immune system, which can worsen autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or multiple sclerosis, and it can react with certain medications or cause upset stomach,” says Maria Portela, M.D., associate professor at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences and chief of Family Medicine. If you have a high fever or a preexisting condition like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes, in addition to those mentioned above, talk to your doctor before taking any supplement. Another consideration: “Elderberry may help relieve symptoms, but it shouldn’t replace antiviral medications such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or baloxavir (Xofluza) for high-risk populations such as people who are immunocompromised,” Portela says. “Unlike elderberry, these medications have undergone rigorous clinical trials and are FDA-approved for influenza treatment,"" she says. If you take any type of medicine or supplement, you should also check with your doctor before trying elderberry. “Elderberry and other botanical supplements can interact with other medications or supplements and might have other side effects,” Cohen says. “In the case of elderberry, it might have a diuretic effect or make people a little dehydrated. But that effect is unpredictable because you can’t really know how much of the active ingredient is in the supplement. Because of the lack of standardization, you’re in a bind.” Shopping for supplements: What to look for If your doctor gives you the green light and you want to add elderberry to your cold and flu cabinet, some clues on the label can help you choose wisely, Hardy says. For instance, in addition to the common name (elderberry), look for the botanical name (Sambucus nigra) on the label. “If I picked up an herbal product and it had the common name but not the scientific name, I would put that product back,” Hardy says. In addition, she says, “a good label will also tell you which part of the plant was used (that should be the berry); how the product was managed (for instance, as crushed dried berry or as an extract); as well as how much of a marker compound is in that extract.” In herbal supplements, the quantity of a marker compound is a tip-off to the quality of the product. Although there are no guarantees that herbal supplements will live up to their claims or be side-effect-free, the following seals of approval offer some assurance that what’s on the label matches what’s in the product: USP (United States Pharmacopeia), NSF (NSF International), or CL (ConsumerLab.com). All of these indicate the product has been tested, audited and certified by an independent organization, “though it’s important to remember that doing so doesn’t guarantee a product’s safety,” Portela says. Bottom line: “Elderberry supplements may offer mild benefits in reducing the duration and severity of colds or flu,” Portela says. “It should not, however, replace flu vaccines, antiviral medications, or supportive treatments such as hydration and rest.” Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Know the risks and complications associated with this popular vision-correction procedure By Linda Marsa AARP Comments En español Published April 24, 2019 ALAMY STOCK PHOTO Alejandro Lopez, 62, started wearing glasses when he was in his 20s in order to read the newspaper and see things in the distance, and never liked them. So in 2000, Lopez, who lives in Malverne, N.Y., opted for what was then a relatively new procedure: LASIK, laser surgery to correct vision problems. He distinctly remembers looking at the clock in the operating room before the surgery, and it was too blurry to read the numbers. When he opened his eyes afterward, the clock was suddenly crisp and clear. “It was amazing and so fast. In 10 minutes, my vision had completely changed,” he says. “I was driving and even went to work the next day.” His vision remains good nearly 20 years later. That's the promise of LASIK: After a quick, relatively painless procedure in an eye surgeon's office, you can ditch your eyeglasses and contact lenses. Since 1995, when the FDA approved the first lasers to correct vision, about 9.5 million Americans have opted for the surgery. Some people experience troubling side effects, however, including severe dry eye. Here are a few things to know about the procedure. What is LASIK? LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) is an FDA-approved procedure to treat all three conditions that normally require glasses: nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. Using an ultraviolet laser, surgeons reshape the curvature of the cornea, the transparent dome-like front covering of the eye that refracts light and accounts for about two-thirds of the eye's optical power. With nearsightedness (myopia), the cornea curves too sharply, which focuses light in the front of the retina and blurs distances. Conversely, with farsightedness (hyperopia), when the cornea is too flat, light focuses behind the retina, blurring near vision. With astigmatism, the cornea can be too curved or too flat, which can cloud both close up and distant objects. First, a surgeon will flatten the eye, then cut a flap in the cornea, peeling it back to reveal the section underneath, which is called the stroma. Pulses from the laser destroy part of the stroma, at which point the flap is replaced. The laser is used to reshape the patient's cornea for sharper sight, depending on what needs to be corrected. The procedure itself usually takes only 30 minutes or less, and while patients can't drive themselves home, they often can recover enough to drive within a day or two. It may take a few weeks or months before the eyes heal and vision clears, however. Because it is an elective procedure, it's not usually covered by insurance and costs average about $4,200. For expert tips to help feel your best, get AARP’s monthly Health newsletter. What are the risks? While a 2009 FDA study found that 95 percent of patients were happy with the surgery, a small number, less than 1 percent, had problematic symptoms. Those can include seeing starbursts, glare or permanent halos, and dry eyes, night blindness or worsened vision. ""The risks are low but they're not zero,” says Anat Galor, an ophthalmologist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami Health System. “Anytime you do a surgery, you are damaging nerves. For whatever reason, some people have a propensity to develop chronic pain because their nerves become too sensitive."" One regretful LASIK patient is Paula Cofer, 60, a former banker in Tampa, Fla. She was becoming resistant to her contact lenses and after a long day at work, she found herself constantly putting drops in her eyes. Her sister experienced positive results with LASIK, so Cofer thought the surgery would help. Instead, her eyes became even drier, resulting in constant burning. She also had floaters that made it hard to see at all, especially at night, and her corneas became inflamed from scarring. “It's been a nightmare,” she says. “My vision has gotten worse and no part of my life has been unaffected by what the surgery did to me.” Cofer runs a website for people who have been harmed by LASIK that she says now includes 6,000 people who've had adverse outcomes. But the technology used in the procedure has improved, says Eric Donnenfeld, a New York- and Connecticut-based eye surgeon who reports having performed thousands of LASIK procedures. “The LASIK of today is much safer and more accurate than LASIK of 20 or even 10 years ago."" Who's most at risk for complications Some people are poor candidates for this surgery. They include those who suffer from diseases that affect wound healing, such as autoimmune disorders like diabetes, or those with a history of glaucoma, eye injuries or previous eye surgeries, along with thin corneas, large pupils (which make them more susceptible to glare, halos and starbursts and inhibits night vision) ordry eyes, which tend to be exacerbated by LASIK. And people older than around 55 may not be great candidates for LASIK in general, some say, because aging eyes are changing — or “unstable” in eye doctor parlance: Their corneas become stiffer, and they may be developing cataracts and presbyopia (the nearsightedness that comes with age). ""You're doing surgery on a moving target. Two years from now, what we did today may be no longer be good for your eyes,” says Galor of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. “This diminishes the ability of LASIK to make you independent of glasses."" LASIK surgeons now do preoperative evaluations to identify who might have problems, including dry eyes. “We now have two good treatments for dry eyes, so we'll pretreat patients to prevent complications later on,” says eye surgeon Donnenfeld, who estimates that he excludes about one-third of patients because they're not good candidates for LASIK."
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/glaucoma-eye-disease/,"Glaucoma Symptoms, Testing and Diagnosis Early diagnosis and treatment can lower your risk of vision loss By Barbara Stepko and Jessica Migala, Updated April 10, 2025 AARP Reviewed by Stan Sack, M.D. Comments En español Published January 07, 2019 / Updated April 10, 2025 Getty Images More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health For years, Andrew Iwach, executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco, has been trying to convince patients to kick their smoking habit. Words like emphysema and lung cancer aren’t always successful. But when people learn that puffing could increase their risk of glaucoma, well, that’s a different story. “I’ve helped more patients quit smoking by letting them know smoking affects vision loss,” says Iwach, board chair of the Glaucoma Research Foundation. Little wonder. As far as illnesses go, a diagnosis of glaucoma can be particularly devastating. But what is glaucoma, and how does it affect your sight? The disease is sneaky: It develops slowly, often without warning, and can lead to irreversible blindness if it’s not treated in time. Glaucoma is caused by fluid building up in the front part of your eye, increasing pressure and damaging the optic nerve — a kind of electric cable that sends visual information from the eyeball to the brain. ""It's called the silent thief of sight, meaning you don't have any signs or symptoms of glaucoma until it's very late in the disease,"" says Tampa, Florida glaucoma surgeon Courtney Bovee. About 4.2 million Americans have glaucoma, but only half are aware of it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease is one of the world’s leading causes of blindness. Particularly at risk: older adults. The Glaucoma Research Foundation reports that you’re six times more likely to get glaucoma if you’re over 60. More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health Types of glaucoma Open-angle glaucoma This is the most common type of glaucoma, with estimates of 90 percent of glaucoma cases in the U.S. It’s called the silent thief of sight because it generally happens slowly and gradually, usually with no warning signs in the early stages. As eye fluid flows through your eye, the same amount should drain out through a mesh-like channel, called the trabecular meshwork (an area of tissue at the base of the cornea). But in open-angle glaucoma, the meshwork becomes partially blocked, allowing less fluid to drain from the eye. The pressure in the eye gradually builds and over time can irreversibly damage the optic nerve. Angle-closure glaucoma This less common form of the disease is caused when “the iris bulges forward and blocks the drainage angle in the eye,” says Sayoko Moroi, chair and professor of ophthalmology at the Ohio State University’s Havener Eye Institute. When the drainage angle gets completely blocked, eye pressure rises quickly. You might also hear this referred to as closed-angle glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma. Normal tension glaucoma In this type of glaucoma , the optic nerve gets damaged even though the eye pressure is within a normal range. Also called low-tension or normal-pressure glaucoma, this accounts for about 30 percent of cases. ""It's kind of tricky because you might go to your ophthalmologist or optometrist, and they say your eye pressure is normal,"" Bovee says. ""But we still see signs of glaucoma. So that's why it requires testing above and beyond just eye pressure."" Glaucoma testing In most cases of glaucoma, patients notice no symptoms. Testing during a comprehensive, dilated eye exam will reveal if there is a concerning rise in your eye pressure, loss of peripheral vision or damage to the optic nerve that indicates glaucoma. You will find out your glaucoma test results in the office during your appointment. Here is what vision specialists use to diagnose glaucoma, according to the Glaucoma Foundation: Specific eye measurements. The tonometer measures your intraocular pressure (IOP), or the pressure in your eye. The test may include a brief puff of air onto the eyeball or applying a pressure-sensitive tip near your eye. High IOP alone doesn’t diagnose glaucoma, according to the National Eye Institute. The pachymeter measures the thickness of your cornea, which plays an important role in glaucoma risk and diagnosis. This test can help confirm a glaucoma diagnosis, as well as the type of glaucoma you have, per the Glaucoma Research Foundation. There are a couple of types of pachymetry, one of which is no-contact and uses imaging to take corneal measurements. Another requires numbing drops before a handheld device touches your cornea, taking measurements. Glaucoma visual field test. The earliest symptom of open-angle glaucoma is usually some loss of peripheral vision, which can only be found through measurable findings at an eye exam, Iwach says. In this test you look straight ahead at a fixed point and tell your doctor when you see a light or object off to your side. Ophthalmoscopy. This test allows your vision provider to examine the back of your eye, including your optic nerve, for evidence of damage from glaucoma. Other names for this test include funduscopy, and there are also different types of ophthalmoscopy, such as slit-lamp ophthalmoscopy. This test is performed by shining a light into dilated eyes through a magnifying lens. This gives your eye care professional a straight line of sight to your optic nerve. Gonioscopy. This test allows your provider to visualize the inside of your eye to ensure fluid is draining out of the eye properly. Your provider needs to place a special mirrored contact lens into each eye to see its drainage angle. To minimize discomfort, numbing drops will be applied to your eyes before these contacts are placed. Next, your eye care professional will shine a light into the eye, using the mirror to look at the drainage angle. Optical coherence tomography. An OCT test for glaucoma first involves dilating your eyes. Next, a machine takes pictures of your eye, which doctors use to examine the health of your optic nerve, per NYU Langone Health. Glaucoma risk factors Everyone is at risk for glaucoma, but some folks are more vulnerable, such as people who: Are African American, Asian American or HispanicAre over age 40Take steroidsHave a family history of glaucomaHave a past eye injuryHave diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or sickle cell anemiaSmokeWear glasses or contacts to correct nearsightedness or farsightedness Getty Images Glaucoma symptoms Alarmingly, there are often no noticeable symptoms of glaucoma, which is why getting regular, comprehensive eye exams is so critical in detection. (You cannot test for glaucoma at home.) However, people with the less common angle-closure glaucoma can experience symptoms of an acute attack, including: HeadacheNausea and/or vomitingSeeing rainbow-colored rings or halos around lightsSevere eye painSudden blurry vision Anyone with these symptoms should be checked by their ophthalmologist or vision care specialist as soon as possible; angle-closure glaucoma can cause irreversible vision loss if not treated right away. Glaucoma treatment Regular checkups and proper glaucoma treatment can help slow or prevent vision loss, especially if symptoms are detected early. “There is a risk of losing significant vision from the disease. But for most people, the earlier we can catch it, the more we can save.... Early diagnosis is paramount,” Iwach says. ""In the last five to ten years, we've really come a long way in terms of how we treat glaucoma,"" Bovee says. ""The paradigm used to be drops, drops, drops, then maybe laser treatment, then surgery. We've really shifted our focus to say we can do a more interventional approach in a more patient-friendly manner."" While glaucoma damage cannot be reversed, Iwach says, most patients can typically control and manage the disease with medicated eye drops, in-office laser treatment or surgery. Medication for glaucoma Prescription eye drops, used every day, are the most common way to lower eye pressure and control glaucoma. Your doctor may prescribe one, or more to be used in combination. Some tackle glaucoma by reducing the amount of fluid your eye produces; others increase the amount of fluid that drains out of the eye. Prostaglandin analogs are the treatment of choice for many patients. They lower pressure by increasing the outflow of fluid in the eye. This category includes latanoprost (Xalatan), travoprost (Travatan), bimatoprost (Lumigan) and latanoprostene bunod (Vyzulta). Other drugs, Rho kinase inhibitors, which include netarsudil (Rhopressa), also lower IOP by helping with the outflow of fluid. Rocklatan, another option, contains netarsudi and latanoprost, a combination that can be very effective. Another advancement in medicated eye drops is the development of a preservative-free latanoprost, Iwach says. Preservatives, which are added to formulas to prevent infection, are known to cause eye irritation for some folks. As people get older, it’s not uncommon to have glaucoma and dry eye﻿. “For these patients, the impact of preservatives can be more pronounced,” he says. Preservative-free formulations allow people to deliver the medication into their eye without this unpleasant side effect. Though prescription eye drops can be effective, they’re not necessarily practical. Some patients may forget to use them; others find it challenging to get them into the eye (a particularly tricky endeavor for people with shaky hands). Durysta is a dissolvable pellet, injected into the eye during a five-minute in-office procedure; it slow-releases IOP-lowering medication and is designed to last for up to six months. Glaucoma surgery Laser surgery The most common type of laser surgery performed for open-angle glaucoma is selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), in which a laser opens clogged channels in the trabecular meshwork to increase the outflow of fluid. SLT is typically used in patients whose glaucoma is being controlled by eye drops, but it can sometimes be used in place of medication. “There has been data to suggest that there are side effects with medications taken every day and they are inconvenient for patients, and that maybe we should consider doing laser treatments before we even start drops,” Iwach says. “There was an interesting study out of the [United Kingdom], which recommended considering doing selective laser trabeculoplasty treatment — which can reduce pressure in approximately 80 percent of patients — and delay the need for eye drops for some patients.” A follow-up study published in 2023 found that after six years, the SLT treatment was more effective in preventing disease progression compared to eye drops and reduced the need for surgery. “The past 10 years, there’s been a gradual migration to using lasers earlier in the treatment regimen, though they are not appropriate for everyone. Some patients are happy with a daily eye drop,” Iwach says. Non-contact lasers When doing SLT, eye doctors use a gonioscope (an instrument including a contact lens placed directly over the cornea). Though the procedure isn’t painful, there is a certain, well, ick factor. Direct selective laser trabeculoplasty (DSLT) is performed through the limbus (the border between the cornea and the sclera, the white of the eye) and doesn’t involve a lens, so there’s no contact with the surface of the eye. What’s more, it takes less time to perform than selective laser trabeculoplasty: “about a second or less for the whole treatment,” Iwach says. Alcon, a company that produces vision care products, has newly acquired the technology, which has clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, and expects to make these devices available to physicians by the end of 2024. Traditional surgery If eye drops and laser treatments aren’t doing the trick, or you can’t handle the side effects from medications, then your ophthalmologist may recommend conventional surgery to create a new way for fluid to leave the eye. In a trabeculectomy, an opening is made in the sclera to allow excess fluid to drain out of the eye and into a small reservoir, which is hidden under the upper eyelid. From there, the fluid is absorbed by tissue around the eye. Implant devices also increase the outflow of fluid. A tiny drainage tube is inserted into the front chamber of the eye, leading back behind the eye, where a small collection area is created to drain off excess fluid. The standard treatment for closed-angle glaucoma is laser peripheral iridotomy. “A laser is used to make a tiny hole in the iris to help release fluid behind the iris,” says Anne L. Coleman, M.D., a professor and chair of the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology. These procedures are very comfortable and are usually done at the ophthalmologist’s office or an outpatient facility. Microsurgery Several techniques and devices are being used to address glaucoma that don’t have the complexity or carry the risks of traditional surgery, Iwach says. These newer, faster, less invasive procedures, called MIGS (short for micro-invasive glaucoma surgeries), use microscopic equipment and tiny incisions. These procedures are performed in an operating room and can take as little as five minutes. Because these procedures aren’t as effective in lowering eye pressure, however, they’re more appropriate for those in the early-to-moderate stage of the disease. Talk to your doctor and insurance company about coverage. MIGS can be done as a standalone procedure but are more commonly done at the time of cataract surgery. “When patients undergo cataract surgery we open the eye, take the cataracts out and put lenses in,” Iwach says. “That gives us opportunity to have access to the trabecular meshwork.” Performing a two-in-one surgery can also cut down on complications. “One of the risks when doing eye surgery is that the incision can create a potential pathway for bacteria and infection,” Iwach says. “But here you’re making a smaller incision, so there’s less of a chance of that happening.” If you’re going to have cataract surgery, it may be worth asking if your doctor would consider doing one of these procedures at the same time. Glaucoma prevention It’s scary stuff, but here’s the good news: If glaucoma is diagnosed in time and treated, you may be able to stop additional vision loss and prevent blindness. “The prognosis is excellent, but people often take their eyes for granted and forget about them until they notice symptoms,” Coleman says. “That’s why it’s important to get examined to assess what your risk is.” The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults, beginning at age 40, get regular comprehensive eye exams with an ophthalmologist. People who are 65 and older should get an eye exam every one to two years. Those with chronic conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, known eye diseases or other risk factors may need to get checked more often.

Discover what your pearly whites can reveal about your health. 1. Damaged tooth enamel can be a sign of eating disorders Although bulimia and anorexia are most common in girls and young women, recent studies show that about 13 percent of American women over the age of 50 have signs of eating disorders. Serious eating disorders can affect men as well. Bulimia, an illness characterized by a cycle of binge eating and self-induced vomiting, often leads to tooth damage. “Acid created in the stomach by vomiting erodes the inner enamel or thin outer coating of the teeth,” says Leila Jahangiri, clinical professor and chair of the ﻿Department of ﻿Prosthodontics at New York University College of Dentistry. The acid will cause damage to the back of the teeth but will usually spare the bottom front teeth. Jahangiri says the damage can be so extensive that the enamel is completely gone and teeth are thinner and can be seriously chipped. Anorexia, another serious illness, is characterized by weight loss, difficulty maintaining an appropriate body weight and distorted body image. Many people with bulimia are also anorexic, says Jahangiri, so those with anorexia may also have damage to their tooth enamel. 2. Pale gums can be a sign of anemia Anemia is a condition that develops when not enough rich, healthy red blood cells are produced in the body. The low level of red blood cells makes a person with anemia feel weak and tired. It can also cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches and an irregular heartbeat. Postmenopausal women are at higher risk of anemia than men due to iron loss. In the United States, approximately 10 percent of the 35 million people over 65 are considered anemic. Domenica Sweier, clinical professor at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, says that along with many other medical conditions, anemia can cause the gum tissue to be a very pale pinkish-white. “A dentist might look at the gum color, ask additional questions and would likely refer a patient to a medical doctor,” Sweier says. It’s important to note, however, that anemia can’t be diagnosed from gum color, but rather should be diagnosed with blood tests. 3. Osteoporosis can put people at risk for tooth loss Osteoporosis is a bone disease that develops when bone density, mass and structure in the body changes. It can lead to loss of bone strength and risk of bone fractures. Both men and women get the disease, but﻿ it’s more common in women as a result of hormonal changes that cause weakening of the bone, which can cause fractures and other skeletal problems. Fifty-four million Americans have osteoporosis and low bone mass. Half are over the age of 50. Osteoporosis is often called a “silent disease” because many don’t know they have it until bones in the body begin to break. Erinne Kennedy, director for predoctoral dental education at Kansas City University College of Dental Medicine, says that along with age, genetics, hormonal changes and smoking, osteoporosis can be a risk factor for tooth loss. Mary Grace Ash, clinical lecturer at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry and course director of gerontology for dental hygienists, says, “There are lots of bones around a tooth﻿, and indications of osteoporosis include tooth recession, mobility and increase in pockets between teeth,” she says. “And a dentist should be able to spot it.” Tooth loss, however, is not always a sign of osteoporosis. Many other conditions can cause the loss of teeth as people age. 4. Complications of kidney disease can lead to tooth loss The kidneys are bean-shaped, fist-sized organs that filter extra water and waste out of the blood and make urine. When the blood can’t be filtered properly, the result is kidney disease. Symptoms include dryness of the mouth, changes in taste and malnutrition. People who have kidney disease often have compromised immune systems and chronic inflammation. A compromised immune system is susceptible to the overgrowth of bacteria or fungus in the body, which can lead to periodontal disease, Sweier says. Periodontal or gum disease is a common bacteria-induced inflammatory disease that causes bleeding gums, wobbly teeth and tooth loss. Some research shows that those with inflammation of the gums have more compromised kidney function. Additionally, recent studies show that inflamed gums provide an opportunity for bacteria to enter the bloodstream. 5. Oral thrush can be a sign of HIV Oral thrush is a fungal infection caused by a fungus called candida, which is normally present in low numbers in the mouths of many people. The problem arises when there’s an overgrowth of candida. This can be caused by several factors, including a compromised immune system. “When present, oral thrush may cause burning and soreness in the mouth and throat, making it difficult to eat,” says Ash. Because people with HIV/AIDS have compromised immune systems, oral thrush is sometimes a sign of the disease. The National Center for Biotechnology Information estimates that around 80 to 90 percent of people with HIV will have oral thrush. If people with HIV/AIDS practice good oral hygiene and have their mouths checked regularly, symptoms can be discovered and treated early. 6. Acid reflux can cause damage to tooth enamel Acid reflux occurs when the contents of your stomach or stomach acid regurgitates into the esophagus. Symptoms can run from nonexistent to mild to heartburn﻿, or what’s known as acid indigestion, which tends to be more common as people age. About 20 percent of Americans suffer from acid reflux. A dentist should be able to detect tooth damage by erosion from acid reflux right away. Jahangari says the damage from acid will appear on the back of the upper and some of the bottom teeth. “You may feel little holes or notches on your back molars, but generally the tongue protects the bottom front teeth,” she adds. The erosion of tooth enamel caused by acid reflux can cause sensitivity to hot, cold or sweet foods and drink, chipped teeth or sharp tooth edges, discoloration or darkening of the teeth, and thinning and shortening teeth, which can cause changes in your bite or pain and irritation in your mouth. 7. Poor dental hygiene is linked to cognitive decline Poor oral hygiene can be a sign of cognitive decline, especially in those who have previously taken good care of their teeth. As brushing, flossing and dental visits become more difficult, the ability to maintain the health of the teeth lessens, says Ash. Research has also linked tooth loss to a higher risk of dementia. Ash says when an older person who has previously taken good care of his or her teeth has food debris in the mouth, the lack of self-care could indicate decline. Caregiver support may be needed. 8. Teeth grinding can be a sign of sleep apnea Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes breathing to stop or become very shallow during sleep. Pauses in breathing may last from a few seconds to minutes and may happen 30 times or more during an hour. The National Sleep Foundation has found that 1 in 4 people with sleep apnea also grind their teeth at night. Symptoms include snoring, teeth grinding and gasping. Untreated sleep apnea is linked to serious health problems including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, liver problems and possibly even dementia. “It’s amazing what we can learn from studying teeth,” Kennedy says, “and what we learn just may save your life.” Based in New York, Barbara Sadick is a freelance health journalist. Her work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, U.S. News & World Report and The Washington Post, among other publications."
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/blood-test-for-alzheimers/,"A Simple Blood Test for Alzheimer’s? ‘It’s Not That Far Away’ Doctors could soon have a new tool to help them diagnose the most common form of dementia By Rachel Nania, Updated July 29, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published January 25, 2024 / Updated July 29, 2024 Danielle Del Plato A new study adds to a growing sense of optimism that doctors could soon have a faster, simpler and more affordable way to tell if a patient’s symptoms of memory loss and confusion are caused by Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia that affects nearly 7 million older Americans. A team of researchers based in Sweden found that a blood test was about 90 percent accurate in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease in people experiencing thinking and memory problems. In the research study, primary care physicians were 63 percent accurate in an Alzheimer’s diagnosis when not using the blood test; specialists were 73 percent accurate when not using the test, which identifies a specific protein in the blood that serves as an indicator for the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, two defining characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease. The study was presented at the 2024 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference and published in the medical journal JAMA. This blood test and others like it are not widely available to patients outside of research studies, but they could be soon, and that would be a “revolutionary change,” says Paul Newhouse, M.D., director of the Center for Cognitive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and clinical core director for the Vanderbilt Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. What doctors rely on now when making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis is a patchwork of physical and cognitive tests and pricey brain scans or invasive spinal taps. With more studies like this latest one, blood tests could “serve as the first line of defense in diagnosing the disease,” Howard Fillit, M.D., cofounder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said in a statement. A study published earlier this year in JAMA Neurology examined the accuracy of a blood test that identifies the same protein in the blood, called p-tau217. The research team found that the blood test was more than 90 percent accurate and was on par with the gold-standard diagnostic tools — positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid collected from a lumbar puncture — in detecting the brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Previous studies have produced promising results, too, so evidence continues to build for the use of blood tests in clinical settings, says Ronald Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. “I think this is a step forward; this is important. This is something that the field has been waiting for,” Petersen told AARP. What are the benefits of a blood test? For starters, a highly predictive blood test could save a lot of time and money when it comes to making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, Newhouse says. PET scans and spinal taps can cost thousands of dollars and are performed only in hospitals or specialty clinics. A faster diagnosis could impact access to new Alzheimer’s treatments that are approved for patients in the early to mild stages of the disease. Research presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s 2024 conference suggests that the wait time for these treatments could be slashed by several years with an accurate and reliable blood test. “Currently, eligible patients are falling outside of the treatment window because it takes so long to receive a diagnosis. An easy-to-use blood test could help address that problem,” researcher Soeren Mattke, M.D., director of the Brain Health Observatory at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said in a news release issued by the conference. Another potential implication: Screening individuals for Alzheimer’s disease, even if they don’t have symptoms. Research shows that Alzheimer’s changes in the brain can start years, sometimes decades, before symptoms begin. Enrolling people in clinical trials who are in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s could help identify treatments that get to work before life﻿-changing symptoms take hold. How long before blood tests are widely available? It’s hard to say with certainty, but Babak Tousi, M.D., head of the Clinical Trials Program at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, predicts blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease will be widely available in the next few years — possibly sooner. “Widely” is the key word here. There are already commercially available blood tests doctors and researchers can use to assist in making an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. But so far none have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and insurance coverage is lacking, so they’re not commonly used in clinical settings. The FDA’s approval is not required for laboratory-developed tests, like these blood tests, but many dementia experts say it’s needed to confirm their accuracy and reliability in a patient population, and therefore to boost their widespread use. Once a blood test is FDA-approved and accepted as an alternative to PET scans and lumbar punctures for an Alzheimer’s diagnosis — and insurers agree to reimburse the cost — we’ll see its full potential to impact Alzheimer’s care, says Anna Nordvig, M.D., a neurologist who specializes in cognitive disorders of the brain at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.﻿ The Alzheimer’s Association has also said it is working on guidelines for the use of blood tests. Concerns about your memory? Talk to your doctor It’s not just clinicians and researchers who can order an Alzheimer’s blood test. The first direct-to-consumer blood test designed to assess a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s hit the market in 2023 without FDA approval — and more could follow. But when it comes to these products, the advice from many dementia experts is cautionary. For one, the results won’t reveal whether you have Alzheimer’s disease; they’ll tell you whether amyloid is present in your blood plasma, explains Zaldy Tan, M.D., medical director of the Jona Goldrich Center for Alzheimer’s and Memory Disorders at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. The problem with that, he says, is some people test positive for amyloid but never go on to develop the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “My worry with direct-to-consumer is that people might make life decisions or other important decisions based on one blood test, which may not mean what they think it means,” Tan says. “I liken it to getting a cholesterol level. Getting a cholesterol level doesn’t mean that you are going to have a heart attack tomorrow.” A recent poll from the University of Michigan supports this concern. Researchers found that a significant share of older adults (74 percent) said a positive result from an Alzheimer’s blood test would make them believe they were likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease; nearly two in three adults (64 percent) said such a result would likely cause them significant distress. And nearly 80 percent of those surveyed said they would consider changes to their financial or advance care planning if a blood test result came back positive. “[Patients] need someone to put results in context,” Tan says. If you have concerns about your risk for Alzheimer’s, talk to a doctor — you can start with your primary care physician. There are things you can do that may help lower your risk, such as manage high blood pressure and treat hearing loss. Another reason to speak with your doctor: If you’re experiencing memory loss symptoms, it could be due to another medical condition, including other forms of dementia. “Not all forgetfulness is Alzheimer’s disease,” Petersen says. Side effects from medications can mimic symptoms of dementia — so can common infections, depression, sleep issues, even a vitamin deficiency. Your doctor can help rule out these other potential causes first and, if needed, refer you to a specialist for further evaluation — possibly even a blood draw in the near future. “There’s no doubt that there is an absolute urgency, and everybody recognizes that [a blood test] is the Holy Grail,” says Maria Carrillo, Alzheimer’s Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead. “And it’s not that far away.”﻿ Editor’s note: This story, first published Jan. 25, 2024, has been updated to reflect new research.﻿ Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments."

You look tired. Ah, those dreaded dark under-eye circles strike again. They aren't dangerous, but they may make you feel self-conscious, suggesting that you might be exhausted or unhealthy when you're perfectly fine, thank you very much. The good news: If you can figure out the reason behind your shadows, you may be able to lighten them up. Causes Sometimes shadowy circles are caused by an excess pigment around the eyes, dark brown/black in color. This type of discoloration tends to be genetic, occurring more often in those with darker skin. It can also be triggered by frequent sun exposure. Allergies, alcohol consumption, which is dehydrating, and, yes, fatigue can also compound the problem. And then there's aging: “As we age, our bodies don't produce as much collagen, which makes the skin under our eyes thinner,” says Edidiong Kaminska, M.D., a Chicago-based dermatologist. “As a result, it's easier to see dark blood vessels lurking beneath the surface.” These shadows — actually oxygen-depleted blood — can be compounded by poor blood circulation and a buildup of fluid, which contributes to puffiness. “Sometimes, if there's chronic swelling,” Kaminska says, “blood can leak into the skin a little, and that can cause discoloration as well."" And as we get older, our facial structure changes. The bones around our eyes widen, creating a sunken look underneath. “It's kind of a double whammy,” says Rachel Nazarian, M.D., a New York City dermatologist. “Not only do our eyes hollow out more, but the fat pad that sits around the eye and cushions it pushes out. That puffiness highlights the hollowness that sits directly below it.” Light can't reflect evenly off the contours, leading to shadows in the area. Cosmetic and medical treatments Here are a few medical ways to treat dark circles. 1. Fillers A hyaluronic acid soft-tissue filler (Restylane is considered by many to be the gold standard) can be injected around the caved-in area along the rim of the eye socket to recontour the face. “By filling in those deep hollows, you're helping them blend in better with the puffy fat pads, so there's less of a dramatic disconnect,” Nazarian says. This can be done very safely by a board-certified dermatologist or a board-certified plastic surgeon, “the only two people who are allowed to put a needle in that area,” Nazarian notes. You'll see instant results, which last up to a year. Bonus: If you're not loving the look, the filler can be dissolved, using an enzyme, within about 30 minutes. Fillers can be combined with another procedure, called platelet-rich plasma (PRP) rejuvenation, to give eyes even more of a boost. PRP treatment “uses your body's own blood to stimulate collagen and rejuvenate the under-eye area,” says San Francisco-based dermatologist Caren Campbell, M.D. How it works: A small amount of blood is drawn, then spun rapidly in a special tube, which extracts the PRP. The blood is then injected back into the skin. According to the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, these two procedures, performed in tandem, can lead to significant improvements in appearance. (A word of caution: Those on blood thinners may not be good candidates; everyone should discuss this and other possible risks with their doctor.) 2. Surgery A lower blepharoplasty, a surgical procedure, usually done in an outpatient setting, involves “taking excess fat in the bulges underneath the eyes and repositioning it around the socket to fill in some of that indentation” for a smoother and less shadowy look, says Mary Lupo, M.D., a New Orleans dermatologist and clinical professor of dermatology at the Tulane University School of Medicine. It may take up to two weeks for the bruising to go away, and a few months for all of the swelling to subside. 3. Peels If pigmentation is the issue, you might consider an in-office chemical peel, which dissolves layers of skin to lift some of that dark color and lighten discoloration. Peels come in varying concentrations and target different parts of the skin. A light chemical peel (or “lunchtime peel""), for example, removes the outer layer of skin, while a medium chemical peel targets skin cells from the epidermis plus part of the dermis underneath. “The benefits are twofold,” Lupo says. It exfoliates excess pigment and, like retinol, stimulates new epidermal growth and collagen production. 4. Lasers One way shadows can be shushed is with lasers, which can be used to stimulate collagen production. “When you thicken the skin, you see circles less,” says Lupo. They can also be used to target blood vessels underneath the skin. Other ways to minimize dark circles Try these over-the-counter treatments and lifestyle behaviors to banish the circles. 5. Treat your allergies Seasonal allergies — and the nasal congestion that comes with them — can lead to a kind of clogging in the small veins underneath the eyes. When the blood vessels become blocked, blood starts to pool, causing them to dilate and become darker. (There's even a name for this: allergic shiners.) To stay in the clear, down an oral antihistamine or use a saline nasal spray. Double up by using eye drops to get the allergens out of the mucous membranes in the eyes. And play keep-away with pollen and other allergens. Wear wraparound sunglasses when outside, and wash your hair and bedding more often. And resist the urge to rub your itchy eyes; rubbing can damage the walls of the blood vessels, causing them to break and release pigment. “Most people who do these things regularly see an improvement in vascular circles within 30 days,” Lupo says. 6. Smooth things over Eye creams that contain vitamin K can help stimulate blood flow to prevent pooling around the eyes from leaky blood vessels. Caffeine is another ingredient to look for in skin products: “It helps constrict blood vessels to help temporarily with puffiness from lymphatic circulation — say, you had a long night, ate too much salt, or slept on your face and woke up a little puffy,” Nazarian says. Pop the product in the fridge. Anything that's cold will help constrict blood vessels temporarily, so you don't see as much discoloration. And yes, topical retinoids (like prescription Retin-A or an over-the-counter product) can help, too. With repeated use, they boost collagen production to increase skin volume and diminish blood vessels. 7. Watch the booze “Limit alcohol intake,” Kaminska says. “It causes the small blood vessels under the skin to dilate and expand, making them more prominent.” What's more, that late-night glass of vino can dehydrate the skin, giving eyes a sunken look, which makes any discoloration lurking beneath the surface easier to see. 8. Sleep more Poor sleep often leads to pallid skin, making any shadows you might have all the more conspicuous. Your sleep position matters too. “No one has circles as bad as a face sleeper, because fluid tends to pool in the space below your eyes making the area appear swollen,” says Lupo, who suggests sleeping on your back, with your head elevated on two or three pillows. 9. Try skin-lightening creams or serums They can fade pigmentation over time. Hydroquinone is a potent lightening agent that essentially bleaches out darkened areas of skin. It also minimizes the activity of tyrosinase, an enzyme needed to make melanin. It's available by prescription at a concentration of about 4 percent or over the counter at lower concentrations. Kojic acid is another bleaching agent that works in much the same way, though it tends to be gentler on the skin. Two ingredients you'll find in over-the-counter skin-care serums: licorice extract — which helps break up excess pigment and lighten discoloration — and vitamin C — an overachieving antioxidant that's brimming with brightening properties to improve a lackluster look and also neutralizes free radical damage, helping to prevent pigment from popping up in the first place. Before picking up a potion, keep in mind: “Care should be taken in this thin-skinned sensitive area,” says Campbell, who suggests consulting with a dermatologist to find the appropriate topical agent for your skin.. 10. Shun the sun That bright orange orb is bad news. Constant UV exposure can cause skin cells to produce more pigment. What's more, says Lupo, sunlight thins the collagen fibers in your dermis, so those pesky blood vessels show through more easily. Slip on sunglasses with UV protection, and when applying sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) to your face, don't forget the vulnerable under-eye area.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-presbyopia/,"Presbyopia Symptoms and Treatments What you need to know about age-related vision changes By Lauren Evoy Davis, AARP Comments En español Published May 08, 2025 Liam Eisenberg If you’re starting to hold restaurant menus further and further away to see better, you are likely experiencing presbyopia. It’s not a disease, but a natural sign of aging, like graying hair. Presbyopia, with Greek and Latin origins roughly meaning “old eye” is the medical term for your vision becoming less clear over time, affecting approximately 128 million people in the United States, according to the American Optometric Association (AOA). It typically starts when people are in their 40s, when they start notice they're having a harder time clearly seeing things close up. Just as muscles anywhere else in your body often become less flexible as you get older, this happens as the eye muscles become less flexible, says Vicky Wong, president of the American Optometric Association. Symptoms and conditions The main symptom of presbyopia is the inability to see things clearly up close. Other symptoms or conditions include: Blurry eyesDouble visionEye strainHeadachesTrouble focusing Those with diabetes, heart disease, or multiple sclerosis might have an earlier onset of presbyopia. Some medications, such as diuretics, antidepressants, and antihistamines, may also bring on premature presbyopia. Antidepressants can also cause dry eyes and blurred vision. In addition, menopause brings on changes and dryness of the eyes. Diagnosis At an eye appointment, the doctor will put drops in your eyes to dilate them. The doctor will perform and eye exam to determine if you have presbyopia or another eye condition. If you are between the ages of 55 and 64 you should have an eye examevery one to three years, according to AOA. After age 65, you should visit your eye doctor annually. Treatments If untreated, presbyopia can inhibit your quality of life, and there are many options to help correct your vision. Reading glasses It’s a good idea to schedule a yearly eye exam to understand both your vision changes and your overall eye health. Your eye doctor might recommend that you get reading glasses. But this doesn’t mean you need to buy an expensive pair. You may be able to simply buy readers, which increase the close-up fonts and images. If your eyes have very different prescriptions, however, you may need prescription glasses, but when considering cost, you don’t have to buy them from the storefront at your eye doctor. Instead, ask for your prescription so that you can use it online or at discount stores. Contact lenses Contact lenses can be a good option for people who don’t want to keep glasses on hand. Lens types include: Bifocal: The lens has a line between the up-close and distance prescriptionsDiffractive: The lens focuses light by diffraction, which is bending light to two focal pointsMonofocal: One lens corrects one eye for distance, and the other lens for up closeMultifocal: Also called simultaneous vision, this lens has prescriptions for both up close and distance, but without the distinctive line of bifocals. You can choose lenses that you change daily or once per month. Daily lenses cost between $20 to $40 for a 30-day pack. Costs for monthly lenses range from $40 to $120 for lenses, but you can get them at a discounted bulk rate at big box stores. Many vision insurance plans cover eye exams and contact lenses, but may not cover them in full. Eye drops In 2021 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vuity﻿, prescription eye drops to treat presbyopia. You use them once daily, you can expect to get six to eight hours of clearer vision, according to Wong. “I have some patients that will use it just on the weekends, when they're out and about. If they're running errands or going to a kid's game, so that they don't have to keep bringing around their glasses,” says Wong. The drops are a low dose of a medication that makes the pupils smaller and increases the focal range, similar to a camera’s aperture, a fancy word for “opening,” according to Lisa Park, an ophthalmologist and associate professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. However, Park says the drops are not without risks, including, in rare cases, retinal detachment. You can expect to pay between $80 and $100. Insurance companies do not generally cover eye drops. Types of surgery There are several surgical options available, which greatly depend on each person’s vision needs, according to Shahzad I. Mian, M.D., professor of ophthalmology and director of W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Cataract surgery Mian says surgery to correct cataracts, when an aging eye lens becomes cloudy and hinders vision, can also correct presbyopia. This involves removing the lens and replacing it with a plastic lens. It creates monovision, which means one eye is corrected for up close and the other eye is corrected for distance. It may take some time for your brain to adjust. “People who have cataracts also have issues with their reading vision as well, but cataracts tend to become functionally visually significant more when you're in your 60s or older, on average,” Mian says. LASIK LASIK, short for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, is another option. LASIK surgery involves an ultraviolet laser to reshape the curvature of the cornea, the clear covering of the eye that refracts light. This procedure is also very quick and can create multifocal, bifocal, or other types of vision corrections. Side effects can include temporary fuzzy vision, dry eye or a halo effect. Be proactive with your eye health “Don’t ignore eye strain,” says Wong. With more and more people working from small screens on laptops and their smartphones, eye strain can worsen. If you’re struggling with eye strain or need to “reset” your eyes often, like every 15 minutes, it’s time to see an eye doctor.

Health officials announce changes that will likely curb access to shots for some people under age 65 By Rachel Nania, Updated May 30, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published May 21, 2025 / Updated May 30, 2025 Getty Images U.S. health officials are proposing changes to recommendations for the coronavirus vaccine just months ahead of the fall vaccine season. The developments are raising new questions and creating some confusion about who could — and should — get the shot. Earlier this month, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, M.D., and FDA commissioner Martin Makary, M.D., published in article in the New England Journal of Medicine saying that rather than making the shots available to all individuals 6 months and older, like they have been for several years, the agency plans to limit COVID vaccine eligibility to adults 65 and older and individuals with at least one underlying health condition that increases their risk of severe illness from a coronavirus infection. Such conditions include asthma, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer and physical inactivity, among many others. The authors said that for people between the ages of 6 months and 64 years who don’t have any risk factors for severe COVID, “the FDA anticipates the need for randomized, controlled trial data” to evaluate the benefit of the vaccines before licensing them for younger populations. It’s important to note that the COVID-19 vaccine remains on the child immunization schedule for individuals ages 6 months to 17 years, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that children and their parents can receive the vaccine in consultation with their doctor — a process known as shared decision-making. Days after the journal article was published, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., said on social media that the vaccine would also no longer be recommended for healthy pregnant women, despite pregnancy being a risk factor for severe illness. Doctors familiar with the framework say it’s unclear how changes in the vaccine policy would affect insurance coverage for individuals under the age of 65 who have no risk factors. Typically, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel of independent experts that advises the CDC, recommends how federally approved vaccines should be used. Insurers are required to cover certain vaccines recommended by ACIP and adopted by the CDC. Changes raise questions for adults under 65 Federal data highlights the heightened risks of the coronavirus for adults 65 and older. Since the start of the pandemic, about 77 percent of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in adults 65 and older, data from the CDC shows, and hospitalization rates for this age group are much higher than those for younger populations. Still, roughly 17 percent of COVID deaths have occurred in adults ages 50 to 64, and about 5.5 percent in people ages 30 to 49. Robert H. Hopkins Jr., M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, says the changes could “raise, potentially, additional concerns in the health care professional community about the value of vaccinating people at all who are under 65, if they don't have major health conditions.” What’s more, Hopkins adds, the framework excludes people who want to get the vaccine to reduce their risk of long COVID, which affects more than 20 million Americans. According to the CDC, research shows that COVID vaccination is the best way to prevent long COVID, including in children. “There’s an implication that [the vaccine] is not effective, and we know it’s effective,” says Rebecca Wurtz, M.D., an infectious disease physician and a professor in health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. According to a CDC study, the vaccines averted approximately 68,000 hospitalizations during the 2023–2024 respiratory virus season. Wurtz says the shift could also put more responsibility on patients under 65 to familiarize themselves with all the conditions that can increase their risk of severe illness and communicate those conditions to their doctor, especially since it’s unlikely clinical trial data will be available in time for the fall vaccine season. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “The risk factors [outlined by the CDC] are conditions that many people ages 50 to 65 share,” Wurtz says, pointing to obesity as one and trouble hearing as another. Federal research shows that 28 percent of adults 50 and older are physically inactive — another key risk factor for severe COVID-19. Another concern among some doctors: The change proposed in the New England Journal of Medicine article ignores young children, who are not immune to the effects of COVID-19. According to an analysis of data from the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 234,000 children under age 18 were hospitalized with COVID-19 from the fall of 2020 to the spring of 2024. And children ages 0-4 accounted for 58 percent of the confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions from January 2022 to April 2024, the same analysis found. “We’re not talking about and thinking about that relationship between, you know, teachers and health care providers and grandparents getting COVID and transmitting it to their non-immune grandchildren or patients or students,” Wurtz says. CDC data shows that about 13 percent of U.S. children under the age of 18 got the COVID-19 vaccine in the 2024-2025 respiratory illness season. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. Reducing your COVID risk It’s unclear when any outlined changes will take effect. In the meantime, Wurtz says, adults 65 and older who are concerned about getting sick from the virus this summer can get a spring booster, as recommended by the CDC. Individuals who are moderately or severely immunocompromised are also eligible for a spring shot. “We know that immunity wanes over the space of four to six months. And we also know that COVID is a year-round condition, not an influenza-patterned condition,” Wurtz says. “[The vaccine] is safe, it’s effective, it’s covered by insurance, and it’s available at drugstores. And I think people [65 and older] should be reminded to get that booster.” For people under 65 who are not eligible for a spring shot, washing hands often and cleaning frequently touched surfaces can help reduce the risk of getting sick. Opting for outdoor activities over indoor ones and wearing a high-quality mask in public indoor areas can also help. “We have to recognize that COVID-19 is still here with us,” Hopkins says. “It’s still causing thousands of deaths a year. It’s causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations a year. Those numbers are less each year as we come through the pandemic, but as long as the virus continues to circulate, we’re still going to generate new variants.” Editor's note: This story, first published May 21, 2025, has been updated to reflect new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/stomach-symptoms/,"10 Stomach Symptoms You Should Never Ignore They can signal cancer, digestive disorders or another serious disease By Michelle Crouch, Updated March 20, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published February 11, 2020 / Updated March 20, 2025 Srdjan Radevic / EyeEm / Getty Images Everyone has stomach issues from time to time, and occasional digestive discomfort is not usually something to worry about. That said, doctors note that there are a few gastrointestinal symptoms you shouldn’t write off, because they could signal something serious. “I’ve seen many cases where patients have waited way too long before seeking medical attention,” says Christine Lee, M.D., a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Here are 10 symptoms you should never ignore and what they may mean. 1. Prolonged diarrhea Diarrhea can be a symptom of a number of things — from a food allergy to a bacterial infection. It can also be a warning sign of COVID-19, appearing before more well-known symptoms such as cough or fever, says Brennan Spiegel, M.D., director of health services research for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Studies show that as many as half of COVID-19 patients have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and about 15 to 20 percent have only GI symptoms. Diarrhea and an upset stomach can also be symptoms of the flu, though it's more common for children to experience tummy troubles with influenza than adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If you have diarrhea, nausea/vomiting or abdominal pain that lasts more than a day, “don’t wait for a cough or shortness of breath to get tested for COVID,” Spiegel says. If your test is positive, you could be eligible for antiviral treatments that can help keep mild symptoms from progressing to more serious ones. ﻿Prolonged diarrhea can also signal another type of infection or an underlying condition like ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 2. Blood in your stool Whether bright red, maroon or black, seeing blood in the toilet can be frightening. Fortunately, it’s usually not a symptom of anything life-threatening, says Nicholas E. Anthony, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Atrium Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. The most common causes are hemorrhoids and anal fissures (tears in the lining of the anus). But blood in your stool can also be one of the first symptoms of colon cancer, especially if accompanied by a change in your bowel habits or the shape of your stool. Since colon cancer is more common among those over age 50, it’s especially important for older adults to see a doctor without delay. Other possible causes of bleeding are colon polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, colitis and diverticulosis. 3. Severe cramps after eating Severe cramping is a warning sign of a bowel obstruction — a serious condition that requires immediate medical treatment. It’s also a classic symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic digestive disorder that has been on the rise in the last several years. Other IBS symptoms include abdominal pain (often related to bowel movements), bloating, gas, diarrhea or constipation. 4. Difficulty swallowing If you feel like your food is getting stuck in your throat or it hurts as it’s going down, that can be a sign of something serious. “The big thing we worry about is esophageal cancer,” Anthony says. Esophageal cancer is more common in adults over 55 and three or four times more likely to occur in men than women, according to the CDC. ﻿ Other things that can cause discomfort when you swallow include an infection, an ulcer, a sore or scar tissue (which can develop if you have chronic acid reflux). In addition, a growing number of people are being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE), a chronic allergic inflammatory disease that is a major cause of swallowing issues. To pinpoint the cause of your problem, your gastroenterologist will probably insert a tube with a camera attached to it down your throat in a procedure called an endoscopy. 5. Unexplained weight loss (especially if accompanied by abdominal pain) Weight loss when you haven’t changed your diet or exercise habits is a common symptom of many serious illnesses, including cancer, Lee says. “Most people gain weight as they get older because their metabolism slows down,” she says. “If you’re losing weight without much effort, that’s a red flag.” See a doctor if you’ve dropped 5 percent or more of your body weight within six to 12 months. Although such weight loss is a symptom of some types of cancer, research suggests that in patients over 65, it is often due to other causes, like peptic ulcers, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease or an overactive thyroid. 6. Chronic or prolonged constipation (especially if you’re having pain) Almost everyone experiences occasional bouts of constipation, and studies show that it’s especially prevalent among older adults. Constipation is typically defined as three or fewer bowel movements per week. It may not seem like a big deal, but if your constipation isn’t treated, over time the stools in your colon can become so large and solid that your body can’t remove them — and that can be painful or even deadly, Anthony warns. “If it goes longer than seven days, I want to see you,” he says. Constipation can be caused by a wide variety of issues, including certain medicines, a diet low in fiber, and medical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, thyroid issues, diabetes or, in rare cases, colorectal cancer. 7. Sudden, intense abdominal pain A sharp pain that doesn’t let up can indicate acute appendicitis (if it’s on your lower right side), diverticulitis or a serious infection. The context is important, Lee says, because muscle cramps and other issues can also manifest as sharp pain. “If you’re an athlete rock climbing and you get a sharp pain in your abdomen that only lasts a second, you probably just pulled a muscle,” she says. If it’s something serious, she explains, usually the pain keeps escalating and doesn’t let up. 8. Frequent, severe or worsening heartburn Occasional heartburn — a burning, uncomfortable sensation in your chest — is common among older adults and can usually be treated with over-the-counter medications. But if your heartburn is frequent and worsening, or if it’s not responding to medication, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a disorder in which the valve between your stomach and esophagus doesn’t close properly. Left untreated, GERD can lead to complications including erosion or narrowing of the esophagus, or a precancerous condition called Barrett’s esophagus. In rare cases, severe heartburn can also indicate a more serious condition such as esophageal cancer or a hiatal hernia. 9. Swollen abdomen It’s not unusual to feel bloated after you eat a big meal. But there’s a difference between bloating and distension, an actual increase in measured abdominal size. “Do you literally see your belly puffing out? Is it bigger in circumference?” Spiegel asks. If the answer is yes — and the symptom persists after you’ve had plenty of time to digest a meal — it can be a sign that excess fluid or gas is forming in your small intestine as the result of an obstruction, inflammation, bacterial overgrowth or a gastrointestinal disease. 10. Feeling full after eating very little If you feel stuffed even though you didn’t eat much, the most common cause is gastroparesis, a condition in which food stays in the stomach longer than it should. It can happen when a severe illness “stunts the electrical system of the stomach,” Anthony says﻿.﻿ Stomach surgery and diabetes can also trigger the condition, and it's been reported as a side effect of new weight loss medications. Although gastroparesis can resolve on its own, your doctor can prescribe medications that will stimulate your stomach to contract and help speed digestion. If it’s not gastroparesis, other more serious causes of early satiety include an ulcer, an obstruction or a tumor. If you don’t have one of the above symptoms, don’t let that keep you from seeing a gastroenterologist if you suspect that something’s wrong, Lee says. The earlier you detect a problem, the more options you have and the better your chances of success at managing it. “The longer I do this, the more I realize that it doesn’t matter what the textbook says — patients know their bodies,” Lee says. “If something is not normal for you, then it is a red flag, even if it’s not on the list of top five. If something bothers you, you should get it checked out.” Editor’s note: This story, first published February 11, 2020, has been updated to include new information. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Katz AARP Comments En español Published March 03, 2020 Keith Brofsky/Getty Images Does any old apple a day keep the doctor away? Or does it have to be organic? The answer is, honestly, “That's impossible to say right now.” Why is that? First of all, almost nobody eats purely organic versus purely nonorganic, so it's impossible to divide people into two groups for comparison. There's an overlap, and when two groups that are supposed to be different are a bit alike, their outcomes look more like one another. So there's no evidence that organic foods are better for you? We didn't say that. There is a burgeoning array of large observational studies that look at people who reported willfully eating organic routinely versus people who didn't. As of this writing, the most recent study is out of France, where researchers found a significant difference in cancer incidence between those who eat organic routinely versus those who don't. (Those people who ate organic most often had the least cancer, as you'd expect.) Well, doesn't that mean that organic is better after all, if it keeps you from getting cancer? The study really isn't conclusive, though. Aaargh. Why not? Maybe what makes the two groups different is the total level of care they take with their health. It could be that all those people eating organic have access to better medical care, more cash to spend, higher quality of life — that kind of thing. Generally, organic food costs more, which means more well-to-do people — those with better health care and usually better living situations — are more likely to be the ones eating better. So we still don't know for sure. But at least, for the first time, we have a strong association between routine consumption of organic food and an important health outcome. Sue Tallon If I'm looking at organic and nonorganic apples side by side at a store and I can't afford the organic ones, what should I do? A nonorganic apple is better than no apple and better than most other choices. Rinsing conventionally grown produce reduces the pesticide residue and so arguably narrows the difference between organic and not organic. So, yes, get the nonorganic apples and wash them well. It's almost safe to say, “Never pass up an apple.” What about trying to eat locally? ""Locavore” is a relatively new term but an ancient way of eating. Locavores eat — or try to eat — food produced locally, although, of course, the word “local” is pretty vague. Before food was shipped, everyone was a locavore. Now the term has come to have a deeper meaning: that what you eat matters to your health, and the quality and composition of what you eat are in turn determined by how the food is raised, what it's fed and where it's from. Sue Tallon Don't Panic, Eat Organic Since 2004, the Environmental Working Group has been publishing the Dirty Dozen, its annual list of fruits and vegetables most likely to contain pesticide residue, even after being washed. If you're choosing to buy some organic produce, these are the ones to prioritize. Strawberries Spinach Kale Nectarines Apples Grapes Peaches Cherries Pears Tomatoes Celery Potatoes Why is it worth spending extra time and, usually, money to eat locally? Reducing the carbon footprint, supporting local economies, eating seasonally (and fresh), knowing where your food comes from and how it was raised … all these are inarguably positive attributes, and all are characteristics of local food. No one but a fanatic could eat only local food, but concentrating on these attributes would mean you were eating better, more ethically, more sustainably. If you know your produce is being grown on a local farm where chemicals are not being used, you know that you are avoiding those chemicals. If you know the soil is being nurtured appropriately, you know it's rich in nutrients. If your food has not been in storage and transit for days or weeks, it will have much more of its native nutrient content when you eat it. So local sourcing means the foods have better nutrient composition? In general, yes; though if you're sourcing industrially produced corn locally, then probably not. It makes sense that agriculture and health are connected — there's no way around it. So the more you know about how and where plants are grown, the more confident you can be about their nutrient quality. Does soil composition affect animal products, too? Oh yeah. This issue is even more important when you consider animal foods. The nutrient composition of meat is substantially connected with the diet and exercise pattern of the animal. Meat is leaner and has less saturated fat when animals get more exercise, for instance. The composition of meat also varies with what animals eat and the nutrients in those plants, which are in turn influenced by the soil. Sue Tallon Sue Tallon Don't Panic, Eat Organic Since 2004, the Environmental Working Group has been publishing the Dirty Dozen, its annual list of fruits and vegetables most likely to contain pesticide residue, even after being washed. If you're choosing to buy some organic produce, these are the ones to prioritize. Strawberries Spinach Kale Nectarines Apples Grapes Peaches Cherries Pears Tomatoes Celery Potatoes Healthy, nutritious soil means healthy, nutritious meat? When animals graze on grass, as opposed to grains, they keep the soil healthy and produce better meat. And pasture-raised animals may have lower risks of industrial foodborne scourges like E. coli O157:H7, a strain that can cause severe infection and even kidney failure. It came from the intestines of cattle, particularly those that were fed grain rather than grass! So if animal rights and environmentalist arguments don't motivate you to eat local, remember that it also matters to your personal health. Having said that, it is, of course, possible to produce bad or nutritionally deficient food locally. But a main advantage of sourcing locally is that you can see or learn about the production of your food and easily make that judgment. It's also pretty safe to say that a locavore diet does not include nationally distributed food products made in a factory somewhere, which pretty much means it excludes junk food. Does that mean locavores can eat whatever they want? Grass-fed burgers and locally produced cheese all day! Not exactly. It's still important to have a plant-predominant diet, along with balance and variety. Adapted from How to Eat: All Your Food and Diet Questions Answered by Mark Bittman and David L.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/spring-asparagus-recipe/?intcmp=AE-FOD-BB-LL3,"Spring Asparagus Is a Delicacy Worth the Wait Chef David Tanis shares his recipe for a spicy stir-fry PHOTOGRAPHS BY PENNY DE LOS SANTOS By: David Tanis Published April 17, 2019 Fresh green asparagus is a luxurious harbinger of spring, most welcome after months of cabbage, squash and potatoes. By April, in most parts of the country, spring has arrived at last. These days, though, asparagus is available in supermarkets year-round, shipped from Peru or Mexico. Does that matter? If you are a seasonal cook, it does. And I am a seasonal cook. Cooking seasonally means waiting until a particular food is ripe in your region. It's about the joy of anticipation. There's a palpable thrill when spring produce finally comes to market, especially when it's asparagus. But then, I have been called fanatical as far as asparagus is concerned. When I was growing up in the Midwest, asparagus was never on the menu at our house. The only fresh vegetables I can recall were the ones we had in summer: green beans, tomatoes, corn and the odd cucumber or radish. The rest of the year, we had handy frozen vegetables that went straight from freezer to saucepan. After I left home, one of my first cooking mentors introduced me to the wild asparagus that popped up in the moist soil near an irrigation ditch on a remote California ranch. It was a small patch, but each day we could harvest a dozen spears, which we boiled quickly in salted water, doused with butter and ate with our fingers. It was insanely good. Such sweetness That's what I aim for when buying local asparagus. Look for smooth, shiny spears with tightly closed tips. Cook them briefly to keep them bright green, and serve them with your choice of sauce. Melted butter, vinaigrette, homemade mayonnaise or extra-virgin olive oil and lemon are good options. Still, asparagus season lasts several weeks, and sometimes plain but perfect doesn't fit the bill. Then it's time to consider roasting or grilling, or spaghetti with asparagus, prosciutto and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Assertive seasoning complements asparagus, too. This recipe I designed veers Chinese, for a quick stir-fry laden with chilies, ginger, garlic and sesame. Far from overwhelming the asparagus, the spicy contrasting flavors pleasantly accentuate the vegetable's sweetness. In the wok, as in life, opposites often attract. Recipe Spicy Asparagus Stir-Fry Serves 4 Ingredients 1 1/2 pounds pencil-thin or medium asparagus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon grated or minced garlic 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 1 serrano or jalapeño chili, finely chopped (seeds removed if less heat desired) 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 3 scallions, slivered 1 (or 2) red Fresno chilies, thinly sliced into rings 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds Handful of cilantro sprigs Steps Snap off tough bottom ends of asparagus and discard. Cut spears into 2-inch pieces (halve thicker pieces lengthwise). Set wok or wide skillet over medium-high heat and add vegetable oil. When oil is hot, add asparagus and toss well to coat. Season well with salt and pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute or so, then add garlic, ginger and serrano chili. Continue stir-frying for another minute, until asparagus is cooked but still firm and bright green. Transfer cooked asparagus to platter. Next, drizzle with sesame oil.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eye-floaters/,"What to Know About Eye Floaters They can be harmless or signal a vision-threatening problem By Andrea Barbalich and Jessica Migala, AARP Medically reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments Published December 18, 2024 Floaters are deposits of various size, shape, consistency, within the eye's vitreous humour. The perception of floaters is known as myodesopsia. Getty Images Most people will experience eye floaters in their lifetime, especially as they get older. They’re those tiny spots or lines that look like they’re in front of the eye, but they are actually floating inside it. Most of the time, floaters are not cause for worry. But under certain circumstances, they require immediate medical attention. Here’s what you need to know to protect your vision. What are floaters in the eye? Eye floaters are spots that disrupt your field of vision. The vast majority of the time these are a harmless facet of aging and nothing to worry about. That said, sometimes eye floaters are a warning signal of more serious problems. Floaters differ from flashes–also called photopsias–another type of visual disturbance that people experience as a sudden flash of light akin to a lightning bolt in their vision. Floaters are more noticeable when looking at something bright, while flashes tend to be more visible in the dark. What do eye floaters feel and look like? Floaters can be disconcerting. “They can appear as rings, whips, sheets, squiggles or other patterns,” says Ming Wang, M.D., founding director of Wang Vision Institute in Nashville, Tenn. Sometimes they’re in the peripheral vision, other times they’re at the center, or both. Floaters typically appear in one eye and move along with the eye’s motion. For instance, they may shift upward when you look up and drift downward when the eye is still. They’re easier to see on a uniform background (a white wall or a blue sky), or after doing activities that require frequent and quick side-to-side or up-and-down movements, such as driving or reading. Floaters are typically painless, so you should not feel discomfort or as if there’s ‘something in your eye.’ Causes and risk factors of eye floaters Most of the time, floaters are due to normal age-related changes in the vitreous, the gel structure that fills the back of the eye and keeps the eye round. When we're young, the vitreous has a gel-like consistency. Later it becomes more liquid, Wang says, and “strands of protein fibers form together and move through the light pathway in front of the retina.” These are perceived as floating spots, and many people just learn to live with them. Still, floaters can sometimes be severe and impair your ability to see, which can make day-to-day life challenging. Floaters can be signs of a posterior vitreous detachment, in which the vitreous separates from the back of the retina — something relatively common after age 50. “All of a sudden, there will be a ton of new floaters or they’re much larger than the individual has ever been used to,” says Vivienne Hau, M.D., an ophthalmologist and retina specialist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California. It sounds serious but usually isn’t a cause for concern: About 85 percent of patients who experience a posterior vitreous detachment never develop complications, Hau says, and “most symptoms subside within three months.” On the other hand, a retinal tear or detachment is much less common but can become a serious problem. Other causes of floaters include: Bleeding in the eyeEye infectionsEye injuryInflammation of the eye called uveitisSolar retinopathy, which can occur from looking at a solar eclipse, exposure to bright lights, or prolonged reflection from snow Who is at risk for eye floaters People who are very nearsighted (myopic) are at higher risk for floaters: “The eyes of nearsighted people are longer than average,” Wang explains. “The vitreous then has to fill a larger space, which makes it more prone to developing the strands and liquid consistency sooner than those with smaller eyes.” People who have uncontrolled diabetes are also at higher risk because they may have bleeding in the retina, which can manifest as floaters, explains Sean Ianchulev, M.D., professor of ophthalmology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. And trauma, such as a car accident or a punch in the eye, can cause a posterior vitreous detachment or a tear. Recent eye surgery, such as cataract surgery, can do the same. When to contact an eye care provider If floater changes are minor or gradual, there is no need to be concerned. But if the changes are drastic — such as a dramatic increase in the number of floaters, the sudden onset of floaters, seeing something that looks like a curtain coming down over your vision, or any other decline in your ability to see — it can be a warning sign of a retinal tear or detachment. In this respect, “floaters are our friends,” Ianchulev notes. If you notice these signs, see an eye doctor right away or go to the emergency room. Ideally you will want to see a retinal specialist, “they are the most prepared specialists to diagnose and treat these problems and handle cases on an on-call basis,” Wang says. Just be sure you receive a dilated eye exam. “Going for a quick vision check is not enough,” Ianchulev says. The doctor will place drops in each eye to widen the pupil (the opening in the center of the iris, the colored part of the eye), which allows more light to enter the eye. Then each eye is examined with a magnifying lens that provides a clear view of the back of the eye, including the retina, macula and optic nerve. The doctor will be able to see whether there has been a tear or a detachment. Neither one causes any pain because there are no pain receptors in the eye, so the exam is the only way to detect damage, Hau says. If you experience pain, that means there’s generally something on the surface of the eye, not within the eye. While your eyes are dilated, your vision will be blurry and the effects may last for four to five hours. You should plan to have someone drive you home. And bring sunglasses: Your eyes will be sensitive to light. Treatment for eye floaters If eye floaters are not due to a retinal tear or detachment and are merely a minor annoyance in your vision, you do not need to get them treated. Symptoms often get better or floaters become easier to live with or ignore. However, there are two instances where you would need treatment–and that’s in the event of a tear or detachment or if floaters are seriously debilitating to your sight. If you catch a retinal tear early enough, you can have a laser procedure to have it repaired. This can be done in a doctor’s office, and you’ll go home the same day. With a retinal detachment, the retina separates from the back wall of the eye, like wallpaper peeling off a wall, according to the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS). This is an emergency situation and, if not treated promptly, can cause permanent vision loss. But if you act fast, you can save your sight. According to ASRS, retinal detachment repairs have a 90 percent success rate. If your eye floaters are not caused by a retinal tear, detachment, or other serious eye condition but still impair your vision to the point that they affect your quality of life—such as making it difficult to drive safely or work effectively—your eye care provider may discuss two possible treatment options with you: Vitrectomy: An outpatient surgery involves removing the vitreous gel and replacing it with another fluid. Overtime, your body will make more vitreous to replace it. There are risks to this procedure, including retinal tears and detachment, so talk to your provider about the risks and benefits to help you make the best decision for your eyes, says the NEI.Laser vitreolysis: Also known as laser floater treatment, this procedure takes 10 to 15 minutes. After you receive numbing eye drops or local anesthetic, a device will hold your eye open as a laser focuses on the floaters and vaporizes them into a gas that is reabsorbed in the eye. Relief is expected within about 30 minutes. Risks are extremely rare but may include increased intraocular pressure, which can lead to glaucoma, cataracts, retinal tears, retinal detachment, retinal hemorrhage, and an increased number of floaters.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/sleep-apnea-treatment-benefits/,"6 Health Benefits of Sleep Apnea Treatment Plus, nine ways to treat this common condition — including the latest FDA-approved medication By Maria Sokolina, Updated December 23, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 24, 2024 / Updated December 23, 2024 Getty Images Peggy Rucinski remembered the countless nights over the years when she had listened to her husband David snoring, then suddenly stopping, only to resume snoring again after a terrifying pause. His snoring had always been annoying, but the pauses and gasps truly scared her. She said it started suddenly one morning when David complained that he felt extremely tired because he had slept poorly. In addition to David’s disturbed sleep, Peggy experienced something more frightening —her husband sometimes had episodes of confusion. “He scared me because he couldn’t remember things we had just talked about at breakfast. Then he couldn’t remember what our daughters did or where they lived. However, he did know me, his phone number and how to use the computer, etc. I was terrified that he was going into dementia.” David saw a cardiologist, neurologist and endocrinologist and had an MRI and two EEGs. All the tests came back normal. Over the course of the year David had five episodes of amnesia — one about every eight weeks. Each one lasted about 24 hours, and although David recovered from them, he had no recollection of the episode or what happened during that time. “Dave, the love of my life, began having episodes of forgetfulness and confusion on a regular basis,” Peggy said. Finally, David had an appointment with a neurologist who asked about sleep patterns. David told him that in the 90s, he was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and was prescribed a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP﻿) machine that uses mild air pressure to keep a person’s breathing airways open while they sleep. The neurologist felt that apnea was causing the problem. Understanding sleep apnea Patients with sleep apnea experience the full or partial collapse of the breathing tube that leads to complete or partial termination of breathing. Two Types of Sleep Apnea Obstructive sleep apnea: The most common type; your upper airway becomes blocked many times while you sleep, reducing or completely stopping airflow. Central sleep apnea: With this condition, your brain does not send the signals needed to breathe. Certain health problems, such as heart failure and stroke, can affect how your brain controls your chest muscles. Sleeping at a high altitude is another possible cause. Sources: National Institutes of Health and Mayo Clinic The increased levels of carbon dioxide and the low concentration of oxygen in these patients can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and even increased risk of premature death. In addition to snoring sleep apnea is linked to mood disorders, disruptive behavior and a decreased quality of life. Approximately 39 million U.S. adults have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Despite its prevalence, as many as 80 percent of cases go undiagnosed, leaving millions of people at risk of serious health complications. David tried using a CPAP machine. He struggled with three different types and finally gave up. Since CPAP was not an option for David, his primary care physician discussed other options. Two Types of Sleep Apnea Obstructive sleep apnea: The most common type; your upper airway becomes blocked many times while you sleep, reducing or completely stopping airflow. Central sleep apnea: With this condition, your brain does not send the signals needed to breathe. Certain health problems, such as heart failure and stroke, can affect how your brain controls your chest muscles. Sleeping at a high altitude is another possible cause. Sources: National Institutes of Health and Mayo Clinic His doctor suggested oral appliance therapy (OAT) and referred him to me to perform the procedure. I’m a dentist who is board certified in dental sleep medicine. “We were very skeptical at first but … the results have been nothing short of miraculous,” says Peggy. “From the first night he used the appliance, the snoring stopped.... not a peep; just normal breathing.” Now, she said, David gets about six, sometimes seven hours of undisturbed sleep a night. He finds the appliance comfortable and easy to clean. “Most importantly, he hasn’t had an amnesia episode in six months,” Peggy said. The impact of sleep apnea There are several reasons that so many cases of sleep apnea go undiagnosed. Many people do not notice how they slowly get more tired and often blame it on aging. Family members may not pay attention to snoring, noisy breathing and the sudden interruptions in breathing. “Many people think snoring is funny. They don’t see that snoring is a potential indicator of the fact that somebody has sleep apnea. So I always tell my patients, make sure your family listens when you’re snoring. If you’re snoring and you stop snoring for a period of time in between the snores, that’s probably sleep apnea,” said Roger Maxfield, professor of medicine at Columbia University. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity Mild: 5 to 15 events per hour Moderate: greater than 15 to 30 events per hour Severe: greater than 30 events per hour Dentists can see signs of sleep apnea in the mouth and educate patients about the necessity of checking their sleep. Jean-Francois Masse, editor in chief of the Journal of Dental Sleep Medicine and a professor at Laval University in Quebec, said dentists can see signs in the mouth and tongue that a patient might have obstructive sleep apnea. The benefits of treating sleep apnea 1. Enhanced sleep quality By preventing frequent awakenings and disruptions, sleep apnea treatment leads to more restorative rest, ensuring individuals wake up feeling refreshed. “Quality sleep is essential for physical and mental health. Treating sleep apnea can dramatically improve sleep quality and overall well-being,” said Aarti Grover, M.D., medical director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Tufts Medical Center. 2. Increased energy “Untreated sleep apnea can leave somebody fatigued all the time. These people constantly feel like they need to fall asleep,” Maxfield said. Effective treatment reduces daytime fatigue, boosting energy levels and overall alertness. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity Mild: 5 to 15 events per hour Moderate: greater than 15 to 30 events per hour Severe: greater than 30 events per hour 3. Improved heart health Sleep apnea causes repeated interruptions in breathing, which leads to fluctuations in blood pressure and oxygen levels, placing immense stress on the cardiovascular system. Effective treatment helps maintain consistent oxygen levels and stabilizes blood pressure, which in turn reduces the strain on the heart and blood vessels. “Untreated sleep apnea puts a strain on your heart, your lungs, your blood vessels and brain. Your blood pressure often goes up over a period of time with untreated sleep apnea, and that can have consequences,” said Richard Brown, M.D., associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University. He added that treating sleep apnea reduces the risk of stroke and heart attack. 4. Lower risk of cognitive decline, dementia and depression Ensuring continuous oxygen flow to the brain prevents damage caused by chronic oxygen deprivation. Additionally, it allows the toxins to be cleared from the brain, reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Sleep apnea can also affect mental health. “One of the biggest things, which I saw for years in my patient practice, is that the patients who developed obstructive sleep apnea don’t respond well to their antidepressants,” Brown said. 5. Regulated hormone release and improved metabolism Uninterrupted slow-wave sleep facilitates the release of essential hormones that regulate glucose and weight metabolism. “Hormonal balance and metabolic health are closely linked to sleep quality,” Grover said. “Addressing sleep apnea can lead to significant improvements in these areas.” 6. Improved sexual health and intimacy Treating sleep apnea and snoring can enhance sexual health by improving hormone levels and increasing intimacy by allowing couples to share a bedroom again. This improvement in sleep quality and reduction in fatigue can foster a stronger connection and a more fulfilling relationship. About half of people with sleep apnea also experience erectile dysfunction, according to research and men with obstructive sleep apnea commonly have low testosterone levels. Several studies have found that treating sleep apnea improves sexual satisfaction, but research looking at whether treating sleep apnea helps with decreasing erectile dysfunction or increasing testosterone, however, have been inconclusive. Sleep apnea treatments Treating sleep apnea can be done in many ways, each with its own good points and things to think about. Here are nine ways to treat it: CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine: CPAP is the most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It involves wearing a mask connected to a machine that delivers a continuous flow of air to keep the airway open during sleep. CPAPs are highly effective but may not be tolerated by all patients due to discomfort, mask leakage or claustrophobia.Weight-loss medication: On Dec. 20, 2024, the FDA approved the use of the weight-loss drug Zepbound (tirzepatide) for the treatment of moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults with obesity. This is the first medication approved for sleep apnea. In clinical trials, study participants who were treated with Zepbound experienced significant improvements in their breathing while sleeping compared to participants who took the placebo. They also lost more weight than the placebo group, and researchers say their improvements in sleep apnea are likely a result of decreased body weight. “This is a major step forward for patients with obstructive sleep apnea,” Sally Seymour, M.D., director of the FDA’s Division of Pulmonology, Allergy, and Critical Care, said in a statement.OAT (oral appliance therapy): OAT uses custom-made oral appliances (mouthpieces) to reposition the jaw and tongue to keep the airway open during sleep. It is often preferred by patients who find CPAP uncomfortable. OAT can be effective for mild to moderate OSA and is less invasive than surgery.Upper airway stimulation: This therapy, which is often called Inspire (in reference to the company that developed the treatment), involves a surgically implanted device that stimulates the hypoglossal nerve to move the tongue forward during sleep, preventing airway obstruction. The FDA-approved implantable upper airway stimulation device functions like a pacemaker to gently prompt the patient’s muscles while they are sleeping. It is an option for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP or OAT. Most insurance providers, including Medicare, cover Inspire if CPAP treatment was problematic, according to the company’s website. ﻿Surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea: In cases where structural issues in the jaw or face contribute to sleep apnea, tonsil and adenoid removal, correction of a deviated septum, and surgical correction of the soft palate are options for treating sleep apnea. Orthognathic surgery can reposition the upper and lower jaws, enlarging the airway and improving breathing during sleep. This is a more invasive option typically considered when other treatments have failed.Positional therapy: Sleep apnea tends to be worse when people sleep on their backs. Positional therapy involves using devices or techniques to encourage sleeping in positions that prevent airway obstruction. It can be effective for patients whose sleep apnea is primarily positional.Weight loss: Obesity is a significant risk factor for sleep apnea. Losing weight through diet and exercise can reduce the severity of sleep apnea or even eliminate it in some cases. Combining weight loss with other therapies like CPAP or OAT can enhance treatment effectiveness.Myofunctional therapy: Myofunctional therapy involves exercises and techniques to strengthen and retrain the muscles of the tongue and throat. It can improve tongue position and swallowing patterns, reducing airway collapse during sleep.Medications: Doctors sometimes use other medications to help treat sleep apnea along with CPAP or OAT. For example, acetazolamide, a diuretic, can assist with central sleep apnea in some circumstances, and modafinil, used to treat excessive sleepiness, can help individuals stay awake during the day.

Here are some telltale indicators By Rachel Nania, Updated April 29, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 20, 2024 / Updated April 29, 2025 Jon Krause You’re running late because you can’t find your keys. Of course, they’re buried in your bag. You walk into the living room to retrieve something important. What was it again? An acquaintance greets you in the grocery store. Her name escapes you. Moments of forgetfulness can happen at any age, and according to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), may happen even more as you age. Still, memory lapses can provoke anxiety for older adults who are often left wondering whether it’s all normal or a sign of something more serious. “It’s important for people not to be too upset at every little cognitive change,” says John Dickson, M.D., a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Still, research suggests many are. Results from a 2019 National Poll on Healthy Aging found that nearly half of respondents ages 50 to 64 are worried about developing dementia. Similarly, a 2021 survey from AARP found that nearly half of adults 40 and older think it’s likely they will get dementia. In reality, about 1 in 9 Americans 65 and older has dementia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While dementia is not inevitable, it is important to know the warning signs so that you or a loved one can get evaluated if there are concerns, Dickson says. Here’s what to look out for. What is dementia? Dementia is an umbrella term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life. It can diminish focus, attention, language skills, problem solving and visual perception. Dementia can also make it difficult for a person to control emotions and can even lead to personality changes. More than 55 million people worldwide have dementia, according to the World Health Organization. Video: 5 Signs of Dementia 15 warning signs of dementia 1. Short-term memory loss. It’s one thing to forget the name of the actor who starred in the movie you went to see with friends yesterday. It’s another to forget you went to see a movie with friends yesterday. “Those more significant lapses” — especially when it comes to recent events — are concerning, says Judith Heidebrink, M.D., a neurologist and clinical professor at University of Michigan Health. Short-term memory loss can be a common symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common type of dementia, Dickson says. “That’s because the short-term memory-forming center of the brain, called the hippocampus, is affected early in the disease process.” 2. Word loss. We’ve all experienced a time or two when your brain can’t find the right word, even though it’s on the tip-of-the-tongue. That can be normal, says Heather Whitson, M.D., a professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine and director of the Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development. But if it’s happening a lot and you find that a person is substituting in words that don’t fit the conversation, that’s worrying. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits For example, Whitson says, a person might want to ask, “Have you seen my jacket?” But when they can’t find the word for jacket, they ask, “Have you seen my shirt?” Another warning sign is difficulty joining, following or completing conversations. “Those types of communication skills can be an early symptom,” Heidebrink says. 3. Difficulty multitasking. If you’re someone who has always put out a Thanksgiving dinner without a hitch, and suddenly you find that staple side dishes are missing from the spread, the rolls are burned and dinner is delayed by two hours, that could signal something more serious is at play. “If it just doesn't seem like it's happening well, or it's happening with a lot more effort, that would be a sign that there are executive function issues,” Whitson says. What is dementia? Dementia is an umbrella term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life. It can diminish focus, attention, language skills, problem solving and visual perception. Dementia can also make it difficult for a person to control emotions and can even lead to personality changes. More than 55 million people worldwide have dementia, according to the World Health Organization. Video: 5 Signs of Dementia 4. Repetition. “If a person is being told by family or friends that they are repeating questions or repeating stories and statements in a short timeframe, without seeming to realize that they just told the person that, or they just asked that same question and it was answered, that's a red flag,” Whitson says. 5. Personality changes. A sudden and routine loss of interest in family, friends, work and social events can be a warning sign of dementia. “People may feel less comfortable in social situations — holding a conversation, remembering the conversation — so they may start to withdraw from social situations,” Heidebrink says. A 2023 study published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease found that apathy may be a sign that someone is progressing from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) — symptoms of memory loss or thinking problems that are not as severe as dementia — to Alzheimer’s disease. Acting increasingly anxious, confused, fearful or suspicious may also be a sign of dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. 6. New sleep behaviors. While Whitson says sleep issues can be “very common” among older adults, some sleep behaviors, such as sleepwalking, are not a normal part of aging. “It's important to know that there are some types of dementia that are associated with altered sleep behavior — acting out dreams or talking in your sleep, when that wasn't something that the person used to do,” Whitson says. 7. Worsening sense of direction. Changes in sense of direction can also occur with dementia, Dickson says, and this can manifest in things like difficulty driving and getting lost in familiar environments. “Sometimes it's just a loss of confidence,” Heidebrink adds. “People will start to restrict their driving to very familiar, close destinations, sort of low-speed, low-traffic situations, or good weather only.” 8. Depression. A new and sudden onset of depression later in life can be a warning sign of dementia, Dickson says. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, up to 40 percent of people with Alzheimer’s disease suffer from significant depression. Depression may not just be a symptom of dementia but also a potential precursor. A 2023 study published in JAMA Neurology found that dementia risk more than doubled for adults previously diagnosed with depression. 9. Confusion about time and place. If someone forgets where they are, or can’t remember how they got there, that’s a red flag. Another worrisome sign is disorientation about time — for example, routinely forgetting what day of the week it is, says Jason Karlawish, M.D., a neurologist and professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and codirector of the Penn Memory Center. 10. Difficulty with visual or perceptual tasks. Tripping over something because you don’t recognize that it’s in the way, or not being able to make sense of the time on a clock could be warning signs of dementia, Heidebrink says. Difficulty with balance, trouble reading and problems judging distance or distinguishing color and contrast can also be early indicators, the Alzheimer’s Association says. 11. Financial missteps. Money problems may be one of the first noticeable signs of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, according to the NIA. “There's a lot of reasoning and memory that go into financial tasks, and so [money management errors] can certainly be an early way that people experience changes,” Heidebrink says. According to the NIA, signs of money problems can include difficulties with the following: Counting changePaying for a purchaseCalculating a tipBalancing a checkbookUnderstanding a bank statement 12. Changes in judgment. People with dementia may experience changes in judgment and decision making that can affect everything from their appearance to their financial wellbeing, the Alzheimer’s Association says. A recent study led by researchers at the University of Southern California looked at brain images from 97 adults over the age of 50 and found that people who had brain changes associated with early stages of Alzheimer’s were more vulnerable to financial scams. While not a single, definitive indicator, “assessing financial vulnerability in older adults could help identify those who are in the early stages of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease,” researcher Duke Han said in a news release. 13. Misplacing things. We all lose our keys, reading glasses, that important piece of mail you meant to hold onto. But putting things in unusual places, or misplacing something and not being able to retrace your steps, can be an early warning sign of dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. It’s easy to lose track of things, especially when adjusting to a new routine, like retirement, Whitson says. What’s more concerning is if you find what you’re looking for, but have no recollection of putting it there in the first place. “If you’re frequently finding that you just have no memory of being in that room with that [missing object], to me, that is more alarming, because that suggests that something with short-term memory is not registering,” Whitson says. 14. Misusing items. Another subtle symptom “is not using things for their correct and intended purpose,” Whitson says. For example, eating with a spoon when you would usually select a fork, or pouring wine into a beer glass. 15. Hallucinations. Delusions or hallucinations can be a symptom of dementia — “particularly visual hallucinations, like seeing people or animals that aren't there,” Dickson says. Most common types of dementia These conditions are the leading causes of dementia. People can also have mixed dementia, a combination of two or more types, such as Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s is characterized by amyloid plaques and tangled fibers in the brain and by a loss of connections between nerve cells. Damage initially appears in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in memory formation, and gradually spreads. An estimated 7.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s disease, according to a 2025 report from the Alzheimer’s Association. By 2050, this number is expected to rise to 13 million, the same report states. Vascular dementia. The second most common type of dementia results from damage to the vessels that supply blood to the brain. It tends to affect focus, organization, problem-solving and speed of thinking more noticeably than memory. It’s estimated that 5 to 10 percent of people with dementia have vascular dementia. Lewy body dementia. Abnormal protein deposits in the brain, called Lewy bodies, interfere with brain chemistry and lead to problems with behavior, mood, movement and thinking. More than 1 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, according to federal statistics. Frontotemporal disorders. Degenerative damage to the brain’s frontal and temporal lobes is the most common cause of dementia in people age 65 and younger. Symptoms might include apathy; difficulty communicating, walking or working; emotional changes; and impulsive or inappropriate behaviors. According to UCSF Health, frontotemporal dementia affects an estimated 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 people. Additional sources: National Institute on Aging, Mayo Clinic What to do if you notice symptoms If you’ve noticed changes or have any concerns related to your thinking and memory, or that of a loved one, it’s important to call a doctor sooner than later, health experts say. 8 ailments that can mimic dementia Any number of treatable conditions can cause dementia-like symptoms. Some of the most common: Alcohol abuse Anxiety, depression or stress Blood clots, brain infections or tumors Delirium Head injuries Kidney, liver or thyroid problems Side effects of medication Vitamin deficiencies Hearing loss can also be mistaken for dementia, Whitson says. “Sometimes, if somebody is repeating a question, it might be because they didn't hear the answer before,"" she explains. Source: National Institute on Aging A big reason: “There are many possible causes of these changes,” Heidebrink says. “Not every case where someone is experiencing these changes is automatically Alzheimer's disease, for example. There could be other causes — a medication side effect, a metabolic hormone imbalance, something else that could be treatable.” If the changes are due to dementia, an early diagnosis has benefits. For example, there are newly approved medications that may slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, and research suggests the drugs work better in the beginning stages of the disease. Plus, an early diagnosis makes individuals eligible for a wider variety of clinical trials, the Alzheimer’s Association points out. You can start with your primary care provider, who may refer you to a specialist, like a neurologist or geriatric psychiatrist, for a more thorough evaluation and definitive diagnosis. How is dementia diagnosed? Some methods doctors use to help diagnose dementia: Cognitive and neurological tests assess language, math, memory, problem-solving and other types of mental functions.Blood tests, though relatively new and not yet widely available, can measure levels of beta-amyloid and p-tau217, hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.Brain scans such as MRI or PET imaging can spot changes in brain structure and function. These tests also can identify strokes, tumors and other problems that can cause dementia.Mental health evaluations can determine whether a mental health condition is causing or affecting the symptoms.Genetic tests may be helpful if symptoms appear before age 60. Early-onset Alzheimer’s is strongly linked to genetics, according to the Mayo Clinic. Talk with a genetic counselor before and after getting tested.

But there’s evidence that if you are physically active on a regular basis, you can optimize your bone health throughout your life, says Wendy Kohrt, distinguished professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Colorado. Any movement that causes you to fight gravity by standing up and moving is good for your bones. If you want to amp up the protection, these five exercises will help keep you — and your bones — strong for life. AGATA NOWICKA 1. Push-ups You can do these against a wall, on bent knees or on the floor. Extend your arms and put your hands shoulder-width apart on the surface in front of you. Tighten your abs, then bend your arms, lowering your torso toward the surface. Push yourself back up. Perform the exercise three to five times, rest, and repeat for a second set. AGATA NOWICKA 2. Squats You don’t have to do a deep squat for this exercise to be effective. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, then bend at the knees to slowly squat down. (Rest your hand on a sturdy object if you need extra balance.) Squat as far as you can, but don’t let your butt get below your knees. At the bottom of the movement, tighten your buttocks and use your butt and thigh muscles to return to a standing position. Repeat eight to 12 times. AGATA NOWICKA 3. Walk and stomp Bones are stimulated when they’re jolted, something that doesn’t happen on your typical stroll. Running and hiking will fit the bill, but if walking is more your speed, consider a walk-and-stomp routine: While walking, stomp each foot two or three times every 10 steps or so, imagining you are crushing a can. (BTW: Walking on real ground requires you to lift and push off with your legs in a way that’s much more beneficial than using a treadmill.) AGATA NOWICKA 4. Stair-climb Stair-climbing increases bone density, particularly in postmenopausal women, because it forces your body to resist gravity as you climb while strengthening the leg and hip muscles that support your pelvic bones. Use a handrail as needed — and consider adding an occasional stomp for more bone stimulation. AGATA NOWICKA 5. Hip-leg lifts This exercise strengthens the muscles around your hip bones, which are vulnerable to fracture, and can help to improve balance. To begin, place your hand on a counter or against a wall for balance, and set your feet hip-width apart. Shift your weight onto your left foot, then straighten your right leg and lift it out in front of you until your right foot is about 6 inches off the floor. Do a set of eight to 12 lifts, then shift your weight to your right foot and repeat the motion with your left leg. AGATA NOWICKA AGATA NOWICKA AGATA NOWICKA AGATA NOWICKA AGATA NOWICKA Pam M.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/rsv-symptoms-older-adults/,"7 Common Symptoms of RSV in Older Adults Plus, how to recognize if a mild infection is turning severe By Rachel Nania, Updated December 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 27, 2024 / Updated December 17, 2024 AARP (Source: Adobe Stock(2)) It’s the time of year when COVID-19 and flu are top-of-mind for many. But there’s another highly contagious respiratory virus that spreads in the fall and winter months, and similar to the coronavirus and influenza, this bug can be downright dangerous for older adults. It’s called RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus. And while it’s commonly thought of as an illness that affects babies and young children, RSV sends as many as 160,000 U.S. adults ages 60-plus to the hospital each year, and kills as many as 10,000 older Americans annually, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Doctors and public health experts are hopeful that a suite of new RSV vaccines can help keep these numbers down this year. Health officials recommend that everyone 75 and older get an RSV vaccine﻿ if they didn’t get one when the shots first became available in 2023. The vaccine is also recommended for people 60 to 74 who have underlying health conditions, like chronic heart and lung disease. What are the symptoms of RSV? A mild infection RSV can be tricky to identify, since its symptoms tend to mirror those of other respiratory illnesses, including flu and COVID, says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. While infants and babies with RSV tend to display signs of lethargy, apnea (pauses in breathing) and loss of appetite, the infection in older adults can come with a runny nose, congestion, cough, fatigue, a mild headache and fever. Adults can also have a stuffy nose, sore throat and aches and pains, Schaffner says. ﻿7 Common RSV symptoms in older adults Congestion Cough Fever Lack of energy Mild headache Runny nose Sore throat Source: Cleveland Clinic When RSV turns severe While symptoms are usually mild in most, RSV can make some adults really sick, and older adults are at higher risk for complications from a respiratory virus, like RSV. So are individuals with heart and lung disease or a compromised immune system. RSV can cause lower respiratory infections like pneumonia and bronchitis, and it can worsen existing health conditions like asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and heart failure. ﻿7 Common RSV symptoms in older adults Congestion Cough Fever Lack of energy Mild headache Runny nose Sore throat Source: Cleveland Clinic According to Cleveland Clinic, some symptoms that signal an RSV infection is taking a turn for the worse include: Extreme tiredness or weaknessLow appetitePersistent coughWheezingShortness of breathBluish skin, lips or nailsSudden change in mental state Another clue is if your temperature continues to climb, Schaffner says, or if your cough starts to produce sputum (phlegm or mucus), which could indicate that “you’ve developed a complicating pneumonia.” If you notice any of these more serious symptoms, seek medical attention. Treating RSV symptoms Both flu and COVID-19 have prescription antiviral treatments that can help keep a mild infection from turning severe, but no such treatment exists for RSV, which is why Schaffer says prevention with the vaccine is crucial. If you have a mild infection, you can get relief from symptoms with over-the-counter medications. Ann Philbrick, a pharmacist and associate professor and director of community engagement in the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy, suggests a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) to curb any aches and pains from the illness, though it’s always important to check with a doctor or pharmacist first to see which type is best for your needs. For the cough, she recommends guaifenesin (Mucinex) to help “loosen up the mucus.” Guaifenesin can appear in combination products with dextromethorphan, a cough suppressant, but Philbrick generally recommends steering clear of the latter ingredient. “Because typically when we have an infection, a cough is good to loosen things up and get things flowing through the body,” she says. “Where I do recommend dextromethorphan is if that cough is just keeping you up at night and you absolutely cannot sleep.” Again, before using be sure to check with your doctor or pharmacist. Pseudoephedrine can help with congestion, but the medication can also affect blood pressure. “So for patients that have blood pressure issues already, that’s something that I would certainly limit or just kind of stay away from,” Philbrick says. And don’t forget fluids, she adds; staying hydrated is key.

As a result, older adults are increasingly susceptible to being swept up by the obesity epidemic overtaking the U.S. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 44.3 percent of people ages 40 to 59, and 41.5 percent of those 60 and older, are already considered obese. Numerous lifestyle and physiological factors can make losing weight even more difficult than it was when we were younger. Medical conditions that affect energy, stamina and mobility can affect our activity levels. Challenges sleeping, loss of muscle mass﻿, and declining estrogen and testosterone can also be factors in weight gain after 50. Unfortunately, as the pounds creep up, so do your chances for negative health effects. Being overweight or obese can put you at risk for health conditions like eye disease, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis, body pain and even cognitive impairment. With all the focus on weight loss drugs and surgery, it can be helpful to remember there are still science-backed approaches to reaching or maintaining a healthy weight without prescriptions or direct medical intervention. Just be sure to consult with your health care provider on any new weight loss plans and exercise routines before you begin. Understanding your BMI The first step on your weight loss journey may be taking a look at where your weight falls on the body mass index (BMI) scale. Medical professionals use BMI to determine whether someone is considered underweight (below 18.5), healthy weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9) or obese (30 or higher). BMI is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in meters squared. It doesn’t measure important health factors such as the amount of muscle you have, your age or how you carry weight. Weight and your health after 50 The relationship between our body and weight changes as we age, both in terms of gaining and losing weight, and shifts in what’s considered a safe weight. Being obese and having visceral fat can pose particular health problems for people in their 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond. Read more about what weight and health means in your: 50s 60s 70s and beyond It’s also important to remember that a healthy weight number can be different for different people. Some research has shown that people who were normal weight in early adulthood and gradually gained some weight in middle age and older (but did not get obese) can have the lowest mortality rates. The right weight for you should be determined in consultation with your doctor. If you are seeking to lose weight, it’s important to approach your journey with a focus on positive health outcomes. Fixating on dieting and weight loss can lead to negative body image, low self-esteem, eating disorders and malnutrition. Finding a weight management system that works for your lifestyle and that empowers you to feel your best and reach your goals is key to success. Calculate your BMI and learn how factors like age, race and gender can affect results. How do I lose weight fast? We’ve all been tempted to drop pounds fast for a special occasion or the dreaded weigh-in at the doctor’s office. But medical guidance recommends losing only 1 to 2 pounds per week, with the understanding that weight loss may fluctuate week to week. Losing weight too rapidly can result in lost nutrients, negative changes to your metabolism and lost muscle mass, which can be especially concerning for older adults. A slower, steadier pace can result in longer-term weight loss results and better health outcomes. It’s also important to not just focus on the scale, but to celebrate the increased muscle tone and stamina that can come from exercise, along with better health measures like reduced blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar levels. The guide below offers science-backed expert advice on various tools and recommendations to lose weight healthily and naturally. Weight and your health after 50 The relationship between our body and weight changes as we age, both in terms of gaining and losing weight, and shifts in what’s considered a safe weight.

Read more about what weight and health means in your: 50s 60s 70s and beyond Weight loss supplements While no over-the-counter vitamin or supplement will work on its own to cause weight loss, some may support your journey when combined with changes to your eating habits and exercise routine. Vitamins, including multivitamins, can help you avoid a nutrient deficiency while dieting. Additionally, vitamin B12 has been linked to weight loss and increased metabolism. Supplements aren’t typically approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and research has been mixed on their effectiveness for sustained weight loss, although a few have been shown to have a moderate impact. Some supplements can have serious side effects, especially when taken in larger quantities. It’s always important to speak with your health care provider before trying a weight loss supplement. Learn more about vitamins and supplements, including the science behind their role in weight loss. Best foods for weight loss As with supplements, no one food or beverage is the magic potion to make you instantly drop pounds. However, when combined with healthy eating patterns and regular exercise, sleep and stress maintenance, some foods can help burn calories. Foods that are high in fiber, such as apples and carrots, can help curb your appetite so that you eat fewer calories. And high-protein foods like eggs and nuts take longer to digest, which can leave you feeling more satisfied and less likely to overeat. Read more about key foods to help you to lose weight.

That’s why it’s important to look at the pros and cons of the methods used in the diet, as well as potential pitfalls. Learn more about popular diets for weight loss, including Dash, MIND and Noom. Natural home remedies for weight loss Behavioral modifications can help with weight loss efforts, including tweaks to your daily routine and home life. These “home remedies” are backed by science and can include everything from using smaller plates for your meals to brushing your teeth after eating. Most important is to find techniques that resonate with you and will help you stick with your weight loss plans. Read more on home remedies for weight loss. Losing weight in your face Changes to our faces as we age are inevitable, and weight fluctuations can ﻿affect our facial appearance too. Whether it’s weight gain that causes a double chin or wider neck, or rapid weight loss that can increase wrinkles and sagging, body changes often show up in your face first. But you can take steps to maintain a healthy weight in your face. Read more about losing weight in your face. Exercises to lose weight In addition to helping with weight loss, adding exercise to your life is key to reducing stress and improving your energy, flexibility, stamina and balance, which are all especially important as we age. The most important part of starting a new workout routine is finding something that you enjoy.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/pneumonia-vaccine/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by 5 Reasons to Get a Pneumococcal Vaccine It’s now recommended for all adults 50 and older — here’s why you should get it By Barbara Stepko and Rachel Nania, Updated October 24, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published October 30, 2020 / Updated October 24, 2024 Getty Images Health officials are now recommending that all adults ages 50 and older get a vaccine to protect against pneumococcal disease, a serious bacterial infection that can cause pneumonia, meningitis and other illnesses. Previously, the recommendation was that adults 65 and older get the shot — most adults just need one dose —﻿ as well as individuals 19 to 64 with certain health conditions that make them more susceptible to the disease. William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, says the updated recommendations make things “much simpler” for patients and providers. Roughly 30 to 50 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 have an underlying condition that puts them at higher risk for pneumococcal disease, data shows. “So we would really like to vaccinate a large portion of that population,” Schaffner says. ﻿ Plus, invasive pneumococcal disease, which Schaffner describes as “the most serious kind,” tends to occur at higher rates in Black Americans at younger ages (50 to 64). Lowering the recommended age to 50 “will provide protection for that population at a younger age, when they need it,” he says. “This is a great opportunity to prevent much more illness.” ﻿ What is pneumococcal disease? It’s an umbrella term for any infection caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria — pneumonia and meningitis are a few examples. This bacteria spreads when respiratory secretions (think saliva or mucus) are sent through the air by coughing or sneezing and then inhaled. Streptococcus pneumoniae are particularly lethal for the lungs and can potentially lead to pneumococcal pneumonia, the most common type of bacterial pneumonia the U﻿n﻿i﻿t﻿e﻿d﻿ States. An estimated 150,000 Americans are hospitalized with this illness each year, and it kills about 1 in 20 of those infected. Even with appropriate antibiotics, pneumococcal pneumonia, “particularly in people 65 and older,” has a high case-fatality rate, notes Gregory Poland, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. A big reason: As we age, the immune system becomes less able to fight off infections. But studies show the pneumococcal vaccine can help lower your chances of contracting the disease﻿, or reduce its severity if you do get it, possibly saving you from a stint in the hospital or even death. That alone is a good reason to get the vaccine once you’re eligible. Here are five others. 1. It’s flu season Flu season is upon us, and that matters because “pneumococcal pneumonia can follow other viral infections, particularly influenza,” Schaffner says. Here’s how: The flu virus attaches to, and infects, the cells lining the mucous membranes in the back of the throat and nose. Normally, the cells eject infectious agents out of the body via the nose or mouth, or they’re simply swallowed. But when impaired by the flu, the cells lining these membranes allow bacteria to slip down into the bronchial tubes and trigger a secondary infection in the lungs. The infection inflames the air sacs in the lungs and causes them to fill with pus and fluid, making it harder to breathe and triggering a whole host of other unpleasant symptoms. The flu shot can reduce your likelihood of experiencing this dangerous dual flu-pneumonia infection. So can the pneumococcal vaccine, which unlike the flu shot, isn’t given on an annual basis. For most, one jab will do it. That said, if you’re going in for your flu shot and are eligible for your pneumococcal vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says you can get them at the same time. You can also get the pneumococcal vaccine on another visit. ﻿""It does not have to be seasonal﻿,” Schaffner says. 2. It can help prevent serious infections throughout the body Your lungs aren’t the only part of the body vulnerable to pneumococcal infections. Those pathogens can invade other areas as well. “Bacterial infections, by their nature, are dirty infections — they are bugs in our system,” says Ian Neel, M.D., associate professor of medicine and medical director in the Division of Geriatrics and Gerontology at UC San Diego Health. “If left untreated, or if part of a particularly virulent strain, they typically take hold in a specific site — the lungs, for example. If they expand too much, they can get into other surrounding tissues and can move into our bloodstream. And if it’s in our bloodstream, it can get spread throughout our body, which can be catastrophic.” To say the least. Pneumococcal infections can lead to sepsis, which is an aggressive inflammatory response that can ultimately result in organ failure and death. In rarer cases, the infection can pass through the brain barrier and cause meningitis. 3. It might protect your ticker Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U﻿n﻿i﻿t﻿e﻿d﻿ S﻿t﻿a﻿t﻿e﻿s, and the pneumococcal vaccine may help protect against cardiovascular events in adults. A meta-analysis of 18 studies, with over 700,000 participants, found the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23) provided protection from some cardiovascular events — specifically a heart attack — in people who were vaccinated, particularly those 65 years and older. “One of the things we have learned about the germs that cause inflammation in our bodies — these influenza and pneumococcal organisms — is that even after we recover from the acute illness, the inflammation persists for a while and can put us at increased risk of a heart attack,” Schaffner says. 4. It may benefit your brain While more studies are needed, promising research suggests that the pneumococcal vaccine may also be associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. A team of researchers from Duke University reviewed the medication records of more than 5,000 adults 65 and older to seek out a link between the pneumococcal vaccination and a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. They found that people who received the pneumococcal vaccine between ages 65 and 75 had a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease later in life by as much as 40 percent. The results were presented at the 2020 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference alongside other research that also linked the influenza vaccine to a lower risk of dementia. “Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer’s risk later in life, depending on [genetic makeup],” study author Svetlana Ukraintseva said in a news release. “These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer’s prevention, particularly in noncarriers of certain risk genes.” 5. Pneumonia can be sneaky Many people, children in particular, can have this bacteria in their nose or throat and not display any symptoms, since their immune system stops the germs from moving to another part of the body. However, they can still transmit the disease to others. What’s more, symptoms of pneumonia— including fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and coughing up phlegm or mucus — make it easy to mistake for merely a stubborn cold or a bout of flu or COVID-19. But unlike with a cold, flu or COVID, antibiotics are often needed to treat pneumococcal pneumonia. What to know about the pneumococcal vaccine Who needs it: Young children aside, the CDC recommends pneumococcal vaccines for adults 50 and older. Younger adults with certain health conditions may also be eligible for the shot. Which one to get: There are several different types of pneumococcal vaccines on the market — and more in the research pipeline — but the CDC recommends PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21 for older adults. Just know that if you get PCV15, it should be followed by the PPSV23 vaccine, another type of pneumococcal vaccine, at least one year later to complete the series. (This can be shortened to eight weeks when a patient has an immunocompromising condition.) If you’ve received a pneumococcal vaccine in the past but never completed your series, ask your health care provider which shot you should receive. Why you need it: Pneumococcal pneumonia leads to approximately 150,000 hospitalizations each year in the U﻿n﻿i﻿t﻿e﻿d﻿ S﻿﻿t﻿a﻿t﻿e﻿s, CDC statistics show. Young children and older adults have the highest incidence of serious illness, and older adults are more likely to die from it.

However, these changes can sometimes signify serious eye conditions that can lead to vision loss or even blindness, as well as reveal potentially dangerous health issues unrelated to sight. Getting regular eye exams can help to preserve your sight and detect diseases early. At age 45, less than 1 percent of people are likely to have low vision, which means having impaired vision that may make everyday activities like reading and driving challenging and that cannot be fixed by standard means, including glasses, medication or eye surgery. By 75, that number jumps to nearly 5 percent, and then to 15 percent by the age of 85. But losing your vision with age doesn’t have to be a foregone conclusion. Detection of low vision and other potential eye issues through a dilated eye exam can be key to getting an early diagnosis and treatment. “Older age is a risk factor for various eye conditions, including dry eye disease, cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration,” says eye surgeon Jovi Boparai, M.D. , CEO of CorneaCare in Princeton, New Jersey. Eye exams can also help to diagnose conditions unrelated to sight — hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, aneurysms and even brain tumors — because doctors are able to directly see nerves and blood vessels in the eyes. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), problems found in the eye are often the first indicators of diseases that could be elsewhere in your body.

During an exam an optometrist or ophthalmologist looks at cornea, conjunctiva, eyelids, iris, lens, retina and optic nerve. Read more about eye parts and how your vision works, and take our quiz on eye anatomy. How often should you get your eyes checked? Recommendations for the frequency of eye exams for older adults vary slightly and depend on your age, overall health and risk factors for eye disease. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults get a complete eye examination at age 40 (earlier if you have an eye disease or risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or a family history of eye disease). After that exam, your eye care provider can tell you how often you should have your eyes checked in the future. If you are 65 or older, you should get your eyes checked every year or two, the group says.The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that people at low risk for eye problems get an exam at least every two years between the ages of 40 and 64 and annually at 65 or older.The National Institute on Aging has slightly different recommendations, advising that everyone over age 50 have an eye exam annually, or as recommended by their eye care provider, and every year or two after age 60. More frequent eye exams than those noted above may be needed for people with certain risk factors. These include people who: Wear contact lenses or glassesHave a family history of eye diseaseHave a history of eye surgery, an eye injury or previous eye damage from conditions such as strokes Are of Black, Native American or Hispanic descentAre overweight or obese (a body mass index [BMI] of 30 or more)Have health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, that can cause eye issues or vision loss “Diabetes is the number one cause of preventable vision loss in this country, and it's called diabetic retinopathy. If you have any sort of damage to your eyes from diabetes, you very well may need to be seen more frequently,” says Daniel Diamond, instructor of optometric sciences in ophthalmology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. More than 9 million people in the United States have diabetic retinopathy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It’s important to talk with your doctor or eye care professional to find out the best examination schedule for you. If you already have glasses or contact lenses, you’ll want to have your prescription checked, because even minor changes in sight can you at a higher risk for falls.

Opticians do not conduct eye exams or surgery, but they can help you pick out eyeglasses, take eye and head measurements, and adjust your eyeglasses. 9 types of eye tests A comprehensive eye exam shouldn’t take more than 45 to 90 minutes, according to the AAO. After getting a medical history, including a family history, what medications you take and whether you wear corrective lenses, your doctor may perform the following tests. 1. Eye chart test for visual acuity For this test, you will read an eye chart to decipher how well you can see from various distances. One eye will be covered while the other is tested. A phoropter test can help determine what type of corrective lens you need. Getty Images 2. Phoropter test During this test, your doctor will have you look at an eye chart through a phoropter, which contains different lenses and can help to determine the appropriate contact lenses or eyeglass prescription for you. 3. Pupil tests By shining a bright light into your eye, your doctor can see how your pupils respond to light. Normally pupils will respond by getting smaller. If they don’t, or if they react unequally, you could have an underlying problem with your eyes. 4. Peripheral (side) vision test A loss of vision at the sides of your eyes, which you may not even notice in your daily life, can be a symptom of glaucoma. This can be tested with a visual field test, where you look straight ahead at one fixed point and tell the doctor when you see light or an object off to the side. 5. Eye movement test (ocular motility) The ocular motility test evaluates your eyes’ movement. The eye care specialist will look to see if your eyes are aligned and if the muscles work properly. You may be asked to look straight ahead while the doctor moves an object in several directions and asks you to follow it with your eyes while keeping your head still. The purpose is to determine weakness or other problems in your eye muscles that could lead to double vision. A phoropter test can help determine what type of corrective lens you need. Getty Images A tonometry test is also known as an eye pressure test. Getty Images 6. Eye pressure test (tonometry) Tonometry, otherwise known as eye pressure testing, measures your intraocular eye pressure (IOP). The test could include a quick puff of air onto the eyeball or the application of a pressure-sensitive tip near your eye. Eye numbing drops may be used. Having elevated IOP could be a sign of glaucoma. 7. Slit- lamp exam (front of the eye exam) A slit-lamp microscope is used to light up the front portions of your eye, which include your eyelid, cornea, iris and lens. This test can help to diagnose cataracts and identify injuries to the cornea, among other conditions. 8. Dilated pupil exam (retina and optic nerve test) Your doctor may put dilating eye drops into your eye to widen your pupil during an eye exam. Shutterstock During your visit, the eye doctor will likely put dilating eye drops into your eye to widen your pupil, which is the black dot in the middle of your eye. This allows the doctor to examine your optic nerve and your retina, which is a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of your eyeball that converts images into electric signals and sends them to your brain through the optic nerve. “In addition to an exam, your eye doctor may leverage new technology such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) to objectively analyze the different layers of the retina and optic nerve,” says Boparai. This test can cost extra, approximately $45 in some cases, and is often not covered by insurance. “Your eye doctor may also use visual field testing to evaluate your peripheral and central vision. If you have a condition that requires photo documentation, your eye doctor may obtain images of the front of the eye or of the back of the eye using specialized cameras. If you have a corneal condition, your eye doctor may use corneal topography to evaluate the unique shape of your corneas,” Boparai says. Read more about 10 Diseases Eye Dilation Can Spot. 9. Brain and cognitive testing Eye symptoms can sometimes be an indicator of cognitive issues, according to the Cleveland Clinic. In certain circumstances, your doctor may do a cognitive assessment by making conversation with you to make sure that you know details about yourself and your environment. Additional eye tests include specialized imaging techniques that help to provide early detection of problems in the back of the eye, as well as on its surface and inside the eye. VIDEO: These Meals Help Keep Your Eyes Healthy How much is an eye exam? Expect to pay between $50 to $200 for a comprehensive eye exam without insurance. If you are using insurance, your copay may range between $10 and $40. Medicaredoesn’t cover eye exams, glasses or contact lenses unless you have certain conditions like diabetes, age-related macular degeneration, or are at high risk for glaucoma. If you want to do the eye chart test at home, you can buy one online for $20.﻿ What happens after the eye exam? If your eye care professional finds that you need corrective lenses, they will provide a digital or paper copy of the prescription. The prescription could also include your pupillary distance, which is the distance between the pupils of your eyes. You need that number to buy glasses online. You may have to ask for the pupil measurement, as it’s not always routinely provided. Your doctor may also provide recommendations for treatment and follow-up testing for other eye conditions they detect. If your pupils are dilated during the exam, you may be sensitive to daylight and device screens for a few hours and could have trouble focusing on items close to your face. You may want to wear sunglasses or temporary shades immediately after the visit. Arranging transportation is a good idea if you are concerned about driving after eye dilation. Warning signs of eye problems Anytime you notice changes in your vision, it is a good idea to visit an eye specialist. These changes can include: Decreased vision, such as finding it harder to read fine print or textFading of color visionSquinting or eyestrainHeadaches at the end of the dayEye pain or prolonged itchingDrainage or redness of the eyeDouble visionFloaters (tiny specks that appear to float before your eyes)Circles (halos) around light sourcesFlashes of light When vision loss is an emergency According to the Cleveland Clinic, ﻿unexpected or sudden vision loss in one or both eyes (partial or total) is a medical emergency. In some situations, the vision loss can become permanent, and in others, the underlying condition causing the sudden vision loss can be deadly. Sudden vision loss can look like the following: Blurring or fadingDarkening/dimmingA black curtain or sheet covering part or all of your vision in one or both eyesBright flashes or lights that cover part or all of your vision Call 911 if you experience these sudden vision loss symptoms. Migraines can also cause temporary vision loss. It’s important to talk to your eye care specialist or health care provider to see if you need emergency care in that scenario, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Can I check my eyesight myself at home? A home vision test is not a substitute for an exam by a professional eye care provider and will not diagnose any underlying health conditions you may be facing. However, it can be a first step in learning more about your eye health. The AAO offers what’s known as a Snellen chart for adults along with instructions on setting up the test and determining the results. Other possible home tests include the Amsler grid test for macular degeneration. This can be used to check if lines on the grid look wavy or distorted, or if any of the areas of the grid appear to be missing. The American Macular Degeneration Foundation provides a printable grid with instructions. Smartphone apps are available that offer vision tests and even provide prescriptions, but they may require attaching an additional device to your phone. Your eye care provider may be able to offer more information on their accuracy. What does your eye color say about your health? Your eye color may signal a predisposition to certain medical conditions, such as skin or eye cancer. Additionally, some diseases, medications and traumas can make your eyes seem to change color. These changes can happen in the iris, which is the colored part of the eye, or in another part of your eye that makes the eye color appear to change.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/bmi-calculator/,"BMI Calculator Your BMI — a ratio of your weight to your height — helps to determine if you are at a healthy weight Beth Howard, Updated December 23, 2024 AARP En español Published April 20, 2023 / Updated December 23, 2024 This information is for educational purposes only — it’s not intended to provide specific health advice. We don't guarantee the accuracy of the tool and recommend consulting your doctor or health care provider regarding your particular situation. Your body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of your body fat that is based on your height and weight. Some doctors use BMI, along with other health indicators, to assess an person’s current health status and potential health risks. People with higher BMIs are more likely to develop chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and heart disease. To determine your own BMI, use this calculator. BMI calculator results are grouped into the broad categories: underweight, healthy weight, overweight and obesity. As you review your results, keep in mind that BMI has limitations, and should not be used to assess a child’s weight because the appropriate weight for children varies significantly by age. Learn more about how age and race might affect BMI results in our FAQ, below. If you have questions or concerns about your BMI results, talk to your doctor or health care provider. It’s important to know that many factors besides BMI — including family history, eating habits and activity levels — also affect your overall health. Learn more about losing weight naturally and healthily. Body Mass Index (BMI) FAQs Open All What is BMI? BMI, or body mass index, is a screening tool that takes into account a person’s height and weight. It slots people into four weight groups (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obesity) that may be linked to health problems. But BMI doesn’t directly measure a person’s health. The BMI should be used along with other measures, including your level of physical activity, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, to assess your risks for disease. What is a healthy BMI? The healthy weight category is defined as a BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9. A weight in this category is linked to fewer health problems than the underweight, overweight and obesity categories. What should my BMI be? The healthy weight category — defined as a BMI of between 18.5 to 24.9 — is considered ideal. But keep in mind that BMI is not a perfect measure. For example, it does not take into account how much fat you carry or where the fat is distributed, factors that can affect your metabolic health. How is BMI calculated? Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. How accurate is BMI? That depends. BMI can’t tell how much of your weight is from fat or muscle, so it misses information important to assessing your health risks. For instance, athletes can have a high BMI because of their muscle mass, even if they’re not overweight. Also, the definitions for the weight categories are based primarily on white populations, so it may be less accurate for people of other races and ethnicities. How can age or race affect BMI? BMI doesn’t differentiate between fat, bone and muscle; therefore, it may be less accurate for older people, who tend to lose muscle mass and bone density as they age. (That’s why people over 65 may benefit from a slightly higher BMI, between 25 and 27.) Research shows that the BMI definition of obesity overestimates risk in Black people and underestimates it in individuals of Asian descent, which may lead to inappropriate treatment and health disparities.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/do-you-need-rsv-vaccine/,"What to Know About Vaccines After 50 View Series Brought to you by Do You Need to Get the RSV Vaccine? Age recommendations for shots have been updated for the 2024-2025 cold and flu season By Rachel Nania, Updated September 09, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 03, 2024 / Updated September 09, 2024 Photo Collage: AARP (Source: Getty Images(2)) Last year was the first time older adults had the opportunity to get a vaccine that can help prevent complications from RSV, a common virus that circulates during cold and flu season. RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus, typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but the illness can turn severe in older people and infants. Two vaccines for older adults were approved in 2023, and a third was cleared this year. But not many people rushed out to get the shot once it became available. An estimated 24.4 percent of adults ages 60-plus rolled up their sleeves for the RSV vaccine during the 2023-2024 season, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Vaccine fatigue stemming from multiple rounds of COVID-19 shots may have contributed to the low uptake, says Kathleen Linder, M.D., a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases at Michigan Medicine. “I also think that people don’t really appreciate how severe RSV illness can be,” Linder adds. “You hear about something like RSV and you think, ‘Oh, it’s a cold virus. If I have a cold, I’ll go on about my life.’ But the reality is, particularly in older people and in people who are immunocompromised, an RSV illness can be very severe.” As many as 160,000 adults ages 65 and older are hospitalized with RSV each year in the U.S., according to the CDC, and up to 10,000 older adults die from an infection. “That is not insignificant,” says Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair in the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health. Here’s what you should know about the RSV vaccine for the 2024-2025 season. Video: CDC Director Explains Why Older Adults Should Protect Against RSV Who should get the RSV vaccine? The CDC recently streamlined its RSV vaccine guidelines and adjusted the age range for older adults who should get the shot. For this season, the CDC says everyone 75 and older should get the vaccine; so should people ages 60 to 74 who live in nursing homes or have certain chronic health issues, like lung or heart disease, that put them at higher risk for severe illness. People ages 50 to 59 were not included in the recommendations. In 2023, the official advice was to talk to your doctor about getting an RSV vaccine if you were 60 or older. ﻿ The change was made in part to simplify the recommendations and provide clarity on who benefits most from the vaccine, explains Amadea Britton, M.D., an RSV expert and medical officer at the CDC. “We now have a year of data from the first-ever RSV vaccines — we had millions of people get them — and we saw that they were really effective at preventing older adults from ending up in the hospital,” Britton says. “And that’s, I think, a really strong reason to go out and get vaccinated.” Video: CDC Director Explains Why Older Adults Should Protect Against RSV A study published Sept. 4, 2024 in JAMA found that the vaccine was 75 percent effective in preventing hospitalization in its first season. What if you got the vaccine last year? Unlike the COVID-19 and flu vaccines, which have updated formulations this fall, protection from the RSV vaccine is longer lasting. So if you got the shot last year, you can sit this year out, Britton says. According to the CDC, we know so far that the vaccine’s durability lasts for at least two winter seasons, but more data is needed to determine how long that protection will continue. ﻿ Researchers and public health officials are monitoring for signs of waning immunity in clinical trial participants, who are a few years out from their vaccines. “There’s definitely a possibility that this may be a vaccine that we recommend you get more than once in your lifetime,” Britton says. “But not yet.” Which vaccine should you get? Older adults have three options for the RSV vaccine — one from Modern﻿a, mResvia (an mRNA vaccine), one from GSK, Arexvy, and another from Pfizer, Abrysvo. If you’re wondering which you should get, Britton’s advice is to get what’s available at your pharmacy or clinic. “We don’t have any preferential recommendation. Whatever is available is great, it will protect you from RSV,” she says. And in clinical trials, “all of them were shown to be safe and effective,” Britton adds. What are the side effects? The RSV vaccine is “a pretty well tolerated vaccine, overall,” Linder says. Some people may experience temporary side effects, like injection site pain, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, joint stiffness/pain and nausea. These symptoms are generally a sign that the body is mounting an immune response, doctors say. Serious side effects from the vaccine are uncommon, but federal researchers found that a small share of people who were vaccinated with Arexvy and Abrysvo went on to develop a rare neurological disorder known as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS can cause numbness, weakness or even paralysis. Researchers, however, have noted that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk. Can you get the RSV vaccine with your flu and COVID-19 shots? If you’re planning on getting the RSV vaccine this year, and also the annual flu and updated COVID-19 vaccines, know that you don’t need to make separate trips to the clinic or pharmacy. It’s safe to get them all at once, the CDC says. There is a possibility you could experience higher rates of common side effects if you get all three at once, Britton says. “But we’ve seen that a lot of people still prefer to do it, just for convenience.” Want to get the vaccines at different visits? When it comes to scheduling those shots, you don’t need to wait a specific amount of time between the appointments, the CDC says. How much does it cost? The RSV vaccine is available to Medicare beneficiaries at no cost under Medicare’s prescription drug plan, known as Part D. And private health plans are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC in the year after they are approved, but some may cover them in the current plan year. ﻿It’s always a good idea to check with your insurance provider to make sure the vaccine is included in the current plan year and use an in-network provider to avoid out-of-network charges. Out of pocket, the RSV vaccine can cost roughly $300. Are there other ways to protect yourself from RSV? If you’re not eligible for the RSV vaccine but still want to avoid getting sick from the virus, there are some things you can do to lower the likelihood of catching it. Any kind of measures that you would take to protect yourself from flu and COVID-19 also work against RSV, Linder says. “So avoiding people who are sick, wearing a mask if you’re going to be in an area with a lot of people, washing your hands frequently — these are always a plus,” she says. Taking steps to prevent an RSV infection can also lower the likelihood that you’ll experience other health issues too, Linder says. “After an RSV infection, people are at significantly higher risk for heart disease, for example. So just having a respiratory viral infection﻿ doesn’t only mean things are going to be affecting your respiratory system,” she explains.

Outbreak tracking maps show that the vast majority of the country is experiencing high or very high levels of flu activity, and health experts say it’s not clear when infections will slow down. While flu activity typically peaks between December and February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it can stretch into April. Already, the CDC estimates that the current flu season has seen at least 24 million illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths from influenza, and the number of cases continues to climb. For plenty of people, a case of the flu is mostly mild. That is not true, however, as you age. The rate of flu hospitalizations among older adults towers over younger populations, the latest CDC data shows. “Even though people over 60 are less than 20 percent of the population, they account for over 80 percent of the serious complications of influenza,” says William Schaffner, M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. No matter your age, getting a flu shot can help keep you healthy — and while the ideal time is early fall, doctors say it’s not too late. More than half of the overall U.S. population has yet to receive this year’s flu shot, according to the CDC. Roughly 70 percent of older adults got the vaccine for the 2024-2025 season. Unfortunately, a flu shot isn’t foolproof. “So what you do when you get the flu turns out to be very important for this [over 60] age group,” Schaffner says. Emergency warning signs of flu complications If you experience any of the following, seek medical attention right away: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening chronic medical conditions Source: CDC Here are eight ways to hasten your recovery from the flu, and the warning signs of a severe infection you need to know. 1. Call your health care provider ASAP Not everyone who gets the flu needs to see their doctor, but people over 65 do. That’s because age itself — along with many other conditions that often come along in later years, such as diabetes and heart disease — puts you at risk for serious complications from the flu, namely pneumonia. “As we age, our immune system responds less vigorously than it does when we’re younger,” explains Stuart Ray, M.D., professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins Hospital. “Both antibodies and T cells play important roles in protecting against infection and severe disease from influenza. And those tend to decrease during late adulthood.” Your doctor will likely prescribe an antiviral medication that helps your body fight off the influenza virus. Research shows that taking an antiviral, like Tamiflu, at the first sign of the flu can reduce symptoms and shorten your bout of the flu by one day. Don’t postpone treatment With antivirals, time is of the essence. You should take them within 48 hours after symptoms kick in. “What we adults tend to do is say, ‘I’d rather not go to the doctor. Let’s see if I feel better tomorrow,’” Schaffner says. “When we get what we think is influenza, it’s important to contact our health care provider, because the sooner we get the treatment, the better the success of the treatment.” Emergency warning signs of flu complications If you experience any of the following, seek medical attention right away: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening chronic medical conditions Source: CDC Keep in mind: You don’t have to make an in-person appointment. Your doctor should be able to assess your symptoms virtually, and new, over-the-counter tests that check for influenza and COVID-19 make it easier to diagnose flu. Miss your 48-hour window? There’s still some benefit to taking an antiviral “beyond the 48 hours, but it diminishes day by day,” Schaffner says. 2. Stay home The flu is highly contagious, spreading through droplets in the air when you cough, sneeze or talk. And that’s true even before you feel fluish. According to the National Institute on Aging, people with the flu can spread it a day before and up to a week after feeling sick. Don’t leave home until your fever is gone The CDC recommends staying home until you’re fever-free — without the help of fever-reducing meds — for 24 hours. 3. Wash your hands Disease-causing germs are easily spread by dirty hands. You know the drill: Throughout the day, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with regular soap and water — antibacterial soaps have no added benefit, according to the CDC — for at least 20 seconds. Don’t expect alcohol-based hand sanitizer to get the job done Sure, in a pinch it’s better than nothing. But research shows that soap and water are far more effective than hand sanitizers in removing certain kinds of germs. That said, if you’re nowhere near a bar of soap and running water, reach for the hand sanitizer. Just make sure it contains at least 60 percent alcohol. 4. Drink plenty of fluids “It’s important to stay well-hydrated when you have a fever,” Ray says. “Hydration will also help alleviate general malaise.” To that end, keep a big glass of water on the nightstand — juice, broth, decaffeinated herbal tea all work, too. Don’t reach for that morning mug of coffee Same goes for any caffeinated beverage and also alcohol. All of these are dehydrating, which will slow your recovery. “Dehydration means you can’t get your secretions up,” Schaffner says. “It’s more difficult to mobilize [the secretions] out of your chest and cough them up, and that can predispose you to the development of pneumonia.” 5. Rinse and moisten your sinuses A neti pot is one way to clear out built-up mucus in your sinuses. (Make sure you read up on how to use them properly to avoid any potential health risks.) If you’re not comfortable using the little teapot-looking container, here’s another way to relieve congestion and keep your nasal passages moist. “A warm — not hot — shower will immerse you in warm moisture, and that will lubricate your mucous membranes, particularly if you can cup some warm water into your hands, snuffle that up into your nose, and then very gently blow your nose,” Schaffner suggests. Don’t use a humidifier If your humidifier is just-out-of-the-box brand new, that’s one thing. But if you’ve had yours for a while, it’s probably best to skip it, Schaffner says. “They’re usually not cleaned very well, so bacteria grows and suddenly you’re aerosolizing contaminated water.” 6. Consider over-the-counter pain relievers Acetaminophen and ibuprofen aren’t cures, but they can help reduce fever and alleviate aches and pains. Just “be sure to read the label carefully because these medications are not without risk — they can injure the liver, kidneys, intestines and cause other side effects — and these risks rise with age and complex health history,” Ray says. “Moreover, they don’t reduce the risk of hospitalization or death.” Don’t take decongestants Or at least not without consulting your health care provider. Here’s why: “Decongestants contain a combination of ingredients, some of which can increase your heart rate, even raise your blood pressure, and possibly interfere with sleep,” Schaffner says. 7. Stay physically active Forget what your mother said about staying in bed 24/7. “You have to listen to your body. But the more time you spend horizontal, the worse it is — physically and psychologically,” Schaffner says. Don’t overdo it That said, now is not the time to try for your personal best — for example, turning that daily power walk into a run or trying that hot yoga class you’ve been curious about. “Although gentle exercise, even just walking around, will make you feel better,” Schaffner says. 8. Pay attention to symptoms If your symptoms are getting progressively worse — you’ve got chest pain, your temperature is going up, you’re coughing up yellow phlegm — call your doctor, “particularly if you have any underlying illnesses and you’re worse today than you were yesterday,” Schaffner says. Don’t try to tough it out on your own You may be in the early stages of pneumonia, the most common complication of the flu. It can cause severe illness in people of every age, but older adults are among the most vulnerable. ﻿Research published in 2018 found that more than ﻿1 in 6 adults 65 and older who are hospitalized with pneumonia die from the infection.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/dietary-supplement-side-effects/,"Dietary Supplements and Side Effects Natural doesn’t always mean safe, so check with your doctor before popping a pill BSIP / Getty Images By Rachel Nania, AARP En español Published June 16, 2022 It’s common knowledge that prescription drugs can cause side effects — TV ads don’t let you forget that. And plenty of people know that taking over-the-counter medication can lead to unwanted symptoms (think of how some antihistamines can make you sleepy). When it comes to dietary supplements, however, many consumers are unaware that their vial of vitamins or bottle of herbs and other botanicals (think echinacea and ginkgo biloba) could come with risks. And a big reason boils down to how they’re sold — “as openly and as freely as food,” says Pieter Cohen, M.D., an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplement safety. “So just like you can buy some broccoli or a can of tomato sauce, you can just buy whatever sort of supplements or botanicals or probiotics you want in the store,” he says. And this helps to create a ""false impression"" that the powders, pills and capsules can’t cause harm. But a 2015 study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that about 23,000 people wind up in the emergency room each year due to adverse events caused by dietary supplements. Reactions the researchers identified ranged from chest pain and heart palpitations to dizziness and vomiting, and adults 65 and older were more likely to be hospitalized because of them. Rashes, shortness of breath, diarrhea, severe joint or muscle pain, slurred speech and blood in the urine are other possible adverse events that can result from supplement use, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These symptoms can vary from less serious to life-threatening. Did You Know? Fresh fruits and veggies are packed with vitamins and minerals, but manufacturers also add them to everyday foods, like breakfast cereals and beverages. So you may be getting more nutrients than you think through your diet, and taking more than you need raises the risk of side effects. Source: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements How supplements can cause side effects How can a vitamin or plant product cause adverse reactions typically associated with powerful drugs? Reasons run the gamut, experts say. Did You Know? Fresh fruits and veggies are packed with vitamins and minerals, but manufacturers also add them to everyday foods, like breakfast cereals and beverages. So you may be getting more nutrients than you think through your diet, and taking more than you need raises the risk of side effects. Source: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements Supplements, which are not held to the same federal approval standards as over-the-counter and prescription drugs, despite their widespread use, contain active ingredients that can have strong effects on the body, the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements explains. And in some products, these ingredients can be particularly potent. Cohen points to red yeast rice as an example — it’s a traditional Chinese culinary and medicinal product that’s “been used for hundreds of years to treat a variety of problems.” In the U.S., supplements containing red yeast rice are often marketed as effective at lowering cholesterol, and that’s because some red yeast rice products contain a substance produced by the yeast that is “chemically identical to the active ingredient in the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin,” the NIH’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health says. Some supplements contain no or low levels of this substance (known as monacolin K), but others are formulated “more like a prescription drug,” Cohen says. In turn, they can cause the same types of side effects and drug interactions as lovastatin, like muscle pain and weakness and liver toxicity, according to the NIH. And often consumers have no way of knowing how much of this prescription-like substance is present in a supplement. Supplements can also interact with other drugs in dangerous ways. Vitamin K can hamper the effectiveness of blood thinners, while vitamin E can augment their power, increasing the risk of bleeding. And Saint-John’s-wort can weaken the effects of some heart medications, antidepressants and statins. Older adults need to be especially careful when it comes to possible interactions such as these, Cohen warns, since “many people who are over 65 are taking prescription medications.” In fact, more than 4 in 10 adults 65 and older take at least five prescription drugs a day, and nearly 20 percent take 10 or more, according to a Lown Institute report. What’s more, older people don’t metabolize compounds found in drugs and supplements as efficiently as their younger peers. “So taking excessive supplements can certainly lead to more problems in someone [who has a harder time] getting it out of their system, because the kidneys are not functioning like they would in a 20- or 30-year-old,” he explains.

Ginkgo biloba Source: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health/NIH Be a savvy consumer The guidance from experts isn’t to avoid supplements entirely but to exercise caution when using them. “These products are health products and should be considered just like over-the-counter medications,” Cohen says. “We know that we have to be careful with [drugs like aspirin and Motrin]. And supplements should be treated the same way.” His advice: If you’re interested in starting a supplement, step back and think about why you want to take it, and then bring that concern to your doctor. “We actually know that going out and taking a multivitamin just for general health — to prevent heart disease, cancer, you name it — doesn’t work,” he says. So ask your physician if you have a health issue that can be alleviated with a vitamin, mineral or other product. (You can also check out the FDA’s new Supplement Your Knowledge initiative for a list of other questions to bring up with a health care provider regarding supplement use.) If you are already taking a supplement — and more than half of Americans are — it’s important to let your doctor know, says Cara Welch, director of the FDA’s Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Keep a record of what you are taking and how often. Or, better yet, bring the bottles to your next appointment so your doctor can take a look “and adjust accordingly, based on what they know about the patient,” Welch says. If a supplement is recommended, look for one that has a stamp from NSF International or U.S. Pharmacopeia, Cohen suggests. These third-party groups test supplements and verify that they contain the ingredients listed on the label and that they aren’t tainted with harmful substances. And remember that a supplement “should not claim to treat, cure or prevent disease,” Welch says. If you see one that does, that’s a red flag. Finally, if you experience side effects or a bad reaction after taking a supplement, stop taking the product and report it to the FDA. “We have physicians that review every single one of those adverse-event reports to see if they indicate an issue with a particular product or a particular ingredient,” Welch says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/sudden-blurry-vision-in-both-eyes/,"Sudden Blurry Vision in Both Eyes: Symptoms, Causes and Treatment There are numerous causes of sudden blurred vision, some can be a medical emergency By Kimberly Goad, AARP Medically reviewed by Stanley Sack, M.D. Comments Published December 18, 2024 Illustration: Remie Geoffroi Blurry vision is nothing out of the ordinary — especially as you age. Consider cataracts, dry eye, far-sightedness, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration. These are all common among people over 60. And since these conditions develop gradually, your eye doctor can treat symptoms and reduce your chances of severe disease if you keep up with regular eye exams. Sudden blurry vision, however, is altogether different. “Sudden change always indicates a significant issue,” says Ashley Brissette, MD, assistant professor of ophthalmology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York Presbyterian Hospital. “Gradual blurry vision is often due to cataract progression, prescription change, or slow progressive changes to the eye that can be halted with proper treatment. A sudden change may signify a more serious problem that could cause permanent damage to vision.” Here’s what you need to know. Why is my vision blurry? The potential culprits can range from the relatively harmless (like eye strain from too much screen time) to the potentially life-threatening (like a stroke) and plenty of vision thieves in between. “Blurred vision is a hallmark symptom of many conditions because the eye is composed of a complex system of blood vessels and nerves that are directly connected to the same network of blood vessels and nerves involved in conditions that affect the entire body,” says Usiwoma Abugo, MD, spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an ophthalmologist at Katzen Eye Group in Lutherville, MD. What causes sudden blurred vision? Vision loss is considered sudden if it occurs, well, suddenly — as in, over a period of a few seconds or minutes — but also if it happens over the course of a few days. Some or all of your vision may be affected. But any sudden change is potentially serious, even if it resolves on its own. Here are some of the culprits: Illustration: Remie Geoffroi Eye drops Whether over-the-counter or by prescription, eye drops can cause sudden blurry vision. But it’s cause for concern only if the blurriness doesn’t give way to clear-eyed relief within a few minutes, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. If your vision remains cloudy, that could be a sign the formula is irritating the cornea. Illustration: Remie Geoffroi “Occasionally, eyedrops contain ingredients that can be irritating to the eye or may have some toxicity,” says Michelle Andreoli, MD, spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and comprehensive ophthalmologist at Northwestern Medicine. “Typically, the irritating or toxic agents in an eyedrop are the preservatives. If an eyedrop causes blurriness or irritation, the best course of action is to not use the drop again and rinse the eye out with preservative-free over-the-counter artificial tears. This will typically remedy any discomfort or blurriness in two to three hours.” If not, she adds, you should see your ophthalmologist. Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) When you have a stroke (a.k.a. a “brain attack”), part of your brain loses its blood supply, which keeps that area of the brain from getting oxygen. When the affected brain cells are starved of oxygen, they stop working properly and that can cause sudden vision loss. A TIA, often incorrectly dubbed a “mini stroke,” is as serious as a true stroke and can also affect large areas of the brain. A big difference between the two? A stroke doesn’t stop on its own and requires treatment to stop and reverse the effects. With a TIA, the symptoms generally last less than an hour, but may continue up to 24 hours. Retinal detachment As the name suggests, retinal detachment happens when your retina (the light-sensitive layers of nerve tissue at the back of your eye) pulls away from its normal position. If a retinal detachment isn’t treated right away, more of the retina can detach, which increases the risk of permanent vision loss or blindness. Diabetes-related retinopathy People with diabetes — especially those who struggle to keep blood sugar levels in check — face a higher risk of diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in adults. When elevated blood sugar levels remain high for long periods of time, the tiny blood vessels throughout the body, including those in the retina, are damaged. The result: retinal swelling and blurred vision, usually in both eyes. While diabetic retinopathy generally develops gradually, sudden vision loss can occur if a fragile blood vessel bleeds into the eye or a retinal detachment is triggered. Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) With AMD you lose your central vision, leaving you unable to see fine details of whatever it is you’re looking at. Say, for instance, you’re trying to read the time on a clock with hands from across the room or even up close. With AMD, you might see the clock’s numbers, but not the hands. Of the two types of AMD — dry and wet — only the latter comes on quickly. And although wet AMD is less common, it’s much more serious since you lose vision faster with wet AMD than with dry AMD. Closed-angle glaucoma With glaucoma, ocular fluid can’t drain as it should, and the pressure from that build-up in the eye damages the optic nerve, leading to partial vision loss or blindness. This happens suddenly with closed-angle glaucoma (a.k.a., angle-closure glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma), a rare form of the condition. Complicating matters: Although some people experience early symptoms like halos, mild headaches, eye pain, or blurred vision, people at risk for closed-angle glaucoma usually show no symptoms at first. Is sudden blurred vision an emergency? It can be. Obviously, the temporary cloudy vision caused by eye drops isn’t typically a medical emergency. But when blurred vision is accompanied by symptoms such as paralysis, dizziness, or trouble talking (all signs of a stroke) or a sudden increase in floaters, flashes of light, and a dark shadow on the sides or in the middle of your field of vision (symptoms of retinal detachment), it’s a medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention. Not sure? Play it safe. Call 911 or head to the emergency room right away. “Sudden blurred vision is more of an indication of an acute condition in the body that needs to be urgently assessed,” says Abugo. What are the treatment options for sudden cloudy vision in both eyes? It depends on the cause. Blurry vision due to problems with the eye itself may be treated with eye drops, medications, or surgery. If inflammation is to blame, steroids may be used. And if there’s sudden blockage of a blood vessel, the goal is to improve blood flow as soon as possible. “Treatment of blurred vision usually takes a systematic approach that looks at onset — for instance, gradual versus sudden — associated symptoms such as slurred speech or limb weakness, and medical history,” says Abugo. If the blurred vision came on suddenly, your doctor will generally treat the condition causing the sudden blurriness. “This is in contrast to a cataract, which typically is addressed non-urgently over a series of visits that may result in surgery by your ophthalmologist,” adds Abugo. “If any change in vision is experienced, it’s important to see your ophthalmologist right away,” advises Brissette. “Prompt evaluation by a healthcare professional can help diagnose the underlying cause and prevent further damage, which is important to preserving your vision and health.” Illustration: Remie Geoffroi What if you get blurry vision when you stand up? You may have a type of low blood pressure called orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which your blood pressure quickly drops when you stand up after sitting or lying down. “Rapid onset blurriness when you stand is most commonly related to an abrupt decrease in blood supply to the head,” says Andreoli. “Blood pressure issues, medications, and dehydration can often cause this type of change.” If it happens regularly, you should see an ophthalmologist. Symptoms usually improve when you change your medications or make a practice of standing up slowly. Can dehydration cause blurry vision? Dehydration can also raise your risk for dry eye syndrome, one of the most common causes of blurry vision, and that in turn can up your chances of having blurred vision. Can stress cause sudden blurry vision? Stress is to blame for everything from chest pain and a weakened immune system to digestive woes, muscle aches, trouble sleeping—the list goes on. It is not, however, usually to blame for blurry vision. A rare exception: Ophthalmic migraines (a.k.a. ocular migraine and retinal migraine). “Stress can lead to migraine issues in the brain, and this can cause an isolated visual event called ophthalmic migraine which is a loss of vision that lasts 15 to 30 minutes,” says Andreoli. Ophthalmic migraines can affect vision in one or both eyes, adds Andreoli, though research suggests they more commonly affect just one eye. What happens if you have blurry vision and nausea? This odd combination of symptoms should be treated as a medical emergency. “Blurry vision that comes with pain in the eyes and nausea can be very dangerous and can represent a severe eye condition called acute angle closure glaucoma,” says Andreoli. “This can cause blindness very quickly. Any patient with blurry vision, pain, and nausea should immediately call their local ophthalmologist.” Illustration: Remie Geoffroi Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/eye-dilation-diseases/,"10 Diseases Eye Dilation Can Spot Dilating your eyes can help your doctor diagnose serious problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure or a brain tumor By Michelle Crouch, AARP Comments En español Published January 09, 2024 Christian Weber / Getty Images More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health Getting your eyes dilated is no fun. It distorts your close vision and makes bright light painful for several hours after your appointment. But optometrists and ophthalmologists say the short-term inconvenience is worth it. The special drops that your eye doctor uses for dilation allow your doctor to see all the different parts of your eye and spot early signs of problems that could threaten your eyesight and your overall health. In fact, a dilated eye exam can detect more than 270 diseases and abnormalities, according to the American Optometry Association. Looking into a﻿n undilated eye compared to one that’s been dilated is “like the difference between looking through peephole or opening up the door and seeing all the way into the room,” explains Ethan Greenberg, M.D., assistant professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School and an ophthalmologist with M Health Fairview. Unfortunately, many Americans who should have annual dilated eye exams aren’t getting them. Fewer than 60 percent of the 93 million adults in the United States at high risk for vision loss received a dilated eye exam in the preceding year, according to a 2017 survey. Annual exams are especially important for older adults, who are at higher risk of developing eye problems such as cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration. Is it really necessary to have your eyes dilated? Some optometrists have started offering “no-dilation” exams. As an alternative to dilation, they use retinal imaging devices to look at the inside of the eye, which can sometimes cost the patient extra. However, dilation is still the gold standard, Greenberg says. “Nothing fully replaces a dilated exam,” he says. “You’re going to miss some things sometimes without a dilated exam.” A 2017 study published in Seminars in Ophthalmology compared the use of Optomap, a common retinal imaging device, to a traditional dilated eye exam for evaluating patients with a history of retinal detachment. The device’s ability to detect retinal holes, tears and scarring was “poor” compared to a dilated eye exam, the study found. The American Optometric Association’s evidence-based clinical practice guidelines note that dilation is required for a thorough evaluation of ocular structures. The organization recommends that patients ages 65 and older have an annual eye exam with dilation at least once a year. More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health What your doctor can catch with an eye exam During a dilated eye exam, your doctor can check for many different diseases, including some that have no early warning signs. Here are some of the diseases and conditions your doctor can spot with a dilated eye exam: 1. Macular degeneration This eye disease happens when aging causes damage to the part of the eye that controls sharp, straight-ahead vision, leading to vision loss and possibly blindness. Catching it early can allow for treatments that can slow its progress. 2. Glaucoma Because glaucoma often has no symptoms, many people don’t know they have it until it causes significant, irreversible vision loss. Although there is no cure for glaucoma, if it’s caught early, there are treatments that can preserve treatments and prevent vision loss. 3. Cataracts Dilating your eyes makes it easier for your doctor to check for early signs of cataracts, a slow clouding of the eye’s lens that makes it difficult to see, especially at night. 4. Diabetes An eye exam can reveal damage to the blood vessels in the back of your eye, an early sign of diabetes. “We can see blood vessels in the retina better than anywhere else in the body,” Greenberg says. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of blindness in older adults. 5. High cholesterol If your doctor sees a white ring around the edge of your cornea, that can be a sign of high cholesterol, which increases your risk of heart disease and stroke, says Sharon Fekrat, a professor of ophthalmology and a retina specialist at the Duke University School of Medicine. Can You Drive After a Dilated Eye Exam? Your eyes will likely stay dilated for four to eight hours, with your eyesight gradually improving over time. How blurry your vision will be and how long the blurriness lasts will depend on what type of drop your doctor uses and how your eyes react. While many doctors allow patients to drive with dilated eyes, your safest bet is to make arrangements to have someone take you home after your appointment. 6. High blood pressure A dilated eye exam can reveal uncontrolled high blood pressure, which increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. During an exam, “the very small blood vessels look narrowed in the retina, and instead of looking red, they are slightly pink or silvery,” Fekret says. “They are also much narrower than we would expect.” 7. Sexually transmitted diseases Syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, HIV, gonorrhea, genital warts and pubic lice can all affect layers of the eye. Untreated syphilis that shows up in the eye can lead to vision loss and even blindness. Herpes that has been dormant in older adults can appear in the eye if your immune system weakens, Greenberg says. 8. A brain tumor An undiagnosed tumor can cause pressure to build up in the brain and cause changes to your optic nerve that your doctor can see. 9. Cancer A leukemia reoccurrence is sometimes diagnosed through an eye exam, because leukemia cells tend to collect in the eye, Fekrat says. Breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer can also affect layers of the eye. 10. Infections and inflammation Bacterial infections sometimes show up in the eye as blood spots on the retina, especially if it’s an infection like acute endocarditis that affects the heart and blood vessels, Greenberg says. Rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions can also affect the eye. Can You Drive After a Dilated Eye Exam? Your eyes will likely stay dilated for four to eight hours, with your eyesight gradually improving over time. How blurry your vision will be and how long the blurriness lasts will depend on what type of drop your doctor uses and how your eyes react. While many doctors allow patients to drive with dilated eyes, your safest bet is to make arrangements to have someone take you home after your appointment. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

And while interest in cruising is down slightly among the 50-plus population this year compared to last, a recent AAA survey finds that, overall, the share of travelers considering a cruise vacation in 2023 is up. However, the return to the skies and seas does not mean COVID-19 is no longer a threat. “Indoor densely populated places where we’re exchanging exhaled breath with one another is still going to be a concern for me,” says Wilbur Chen, M.D., adult infectious disease physician and director of the University of Maryland﻿, Baltimore Travel Medicine Practice. That concern isn’t limited to COVID, either. Flu spreads in a similar way, Chen points out. It’s important to note, though, that since the start of the pandemic, many cruise lines have invested in better air circulation systems with medical﻿-grade HEPA filters, says travel expert Pamela Kwiatkowski, cofounder and chief insurance officer at Goose Insurance Services in Vancouver, British Columbia. “I think that’s the first step they’ve taken in terms of improving the air filtration system, which removes almost all of the airborne pathogens,” she says. Still, plenty of bugs can lurk on busy boats. Read on to discover some common illnesses you can pick up on a cruise — and what you can do to help keep yourself healthy on your next getaway. ﻿ 1. Flu and other respiratory illnesses Flu season spiked early this year in the U.S., along with another respiratory illness that can be particularly dangerous for older adults, respiratory syncytial virus, which is known as RSV. Cases of flu and RSV have declined from fall’s peak, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows, but the viruses that cause these two illnesses are still circulating in the U.S. and other parts of the globe. “Influenza is complicated during cruise travel because﻿, of course﻿, people on a cruise ship — both the passengers and the crew — may come from different parts of the world, which means that the rates of influenza for your particular country may not necessarily be the same as in other places,” says Jose Lucar, M.D., an infectious disease physician and associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. According to the CDC, flu season in the southern hemisphere, which includes Australia and parts of South America and Africa, typically runs April through September. In the tropics, flu flares up throughout the year. Staying healthy: If you haven’t rolled up your sleeve for the flu shot yet, make sure you get it at least two weeks before going on a cruise, Lucar says. The same applies to the latest COVID booster. When it comes to RSV, there isn’t a vaccine yet, but the FDA could approve one soon. A few other tips: If you’re at high risk for flu complications, talk to your doctor about antiviral treatment and prevention before your trip, the CDC recommends. Don’t forget about high-quality face masks, which can help to tamp down the spread of respiratory illnesses. And be sure to make — and pack — a list of all the medications you take, in case you wind up needing medical care on board. “That just makes it easier for everyone, so that if there is an emergency, if you’re not able to talk really well, you can at least hand the sheet over and it’s done,” Chen says. 2. Norovirus This is one of the most well-known bugs that can foil fun on a ship. Norovirus — marked by diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain — is to blame for more than 90 percent of diarrheal disease outbreaks on cruises, according to the CDC. That said, norovirus outbreaks on ships account for only 1 percent of all such reported cases. “This infection is very contagious,” Lucar says. The virus is also a “hearty” one, Chen points out. It can survive for long periods of time on surfaces and is resistant to common disinfectants. Close living quarters, shared bathrooms, populated pools, busy buffet lines and rapid turnover of passengers make it difficult to control the spread of the virus once it hits a ship. “It’s just really the perfect scenario for transmission of highly contagious GI [gastrointestinal] pathogens,” Lucar says. According to the Cruise Lines International Association, the risk each year of getting laboratory-confirmed norovirus during a ship outbreak is about 1 in 5,500. The association, which says it is the largest cruise industry trade association in the world, noted on its website that crew members use strict sanitation and cleaning practices created with the CDC’s Vessel Sanitation Program. Cabins are cleaned once a day﻿, and other common areas, such as elevators and pools, are cleaned multiple times a day. In late February, more than 300 people aboard a Princess Cruise﻿s ship fell ill with diarrhea and vomiting, according to the CDC, though the agency didn’t cite the cause of the illness that sickened the 284 passengers and 34 crew. The Ruby Princess increased disinfection and cleaning procedures in the wake of the outbreak. Other bugs that have popped up on boats include salmonella and E. coli. One to keep an eye on is shigella, which the CDC notes has been behind GI outbreaks on cruise ships. This bacterium causes an infection known as shigellosis, which can cause fever, stomach pain and diarrhea that can be bloody or prolonged. Typically, the infection is treated with antibiotics, Chen says, but the CDC recently issued a warning that antibiotic﻿-resistant strains are circulating in the U.S. Chen isn’t aware of any outbreaks of the resistant varieties on cruise ships, but it’s something to monitor. Staying healthy: To avoid getting a GI bug, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water before eating and after going to the bathroom and coming into contact with high-touch surfaces, like doorknobs and stair railings. Hand sanitizers don’t work well against norovirus, Lucar notes. Travel expert Kwiatkowski also recommends drinking plenty of water to keep your body running at its best. However, she advises passengers stay away from the water at ports, particularly if a passenger is vulnerable to gastrointestinal illnesses. “Handwashing, cleaning your stateroom, watching what you eat and how much you eat, and making sure that you stay hydrated will go a long way in preventing these illnesses, from you catching them even if they are there,” she says. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist about any medications you should pack, such as loperamide (Imodium) to help treat diarrhea or dimenhydrinate (Dramamine, Gravol) for nausea. If your immune system is compromised, your doctor may want to prescribe something ahead of your trip. 3. Measles Although less common than respiratory and GI illnesses, measles, along with chicken pox and other vaccine-preventable diseases, can circulate on cruise ships. Measles, a highly contagious virus that can linger in the air even hours after an infected person leaves the room, was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, thanks to a successful vaccine program. But cases still pop up in the ﻿States, and the virus is common in many countries around the world. If an unvaccinated or under﻿-vaccinated passenger or crew member contracts the virus and brings it on board, other vulnerable people can get sick, Chen explains. (A ship was quarantined off the coast of St. Lucia in 2019 when measles was reported on board.) The same goes for chicken pox (varicella), which is similarly caused by a highly contagious virus that can circulate among unvaccinated people. Staying healthy: To avoid these and other vaccine-preventable diseases, make sure you’re up to date on your routine vaccines before traveling. Two doses of the chicken pox vaccine are more than 90 percent effective at preventing the disease, and two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles. 4. Seasickness Is the motion of the ocean getting to you? Seasickness, while not contagious or related to an infection, can make you feel downright miserable. The good news: Most people recover quickly from seasickness, formally known as motion sickness, and there are medication﻿s that can help. Motion sickness — which can cause dizziness, nausea and vomiting whether you’re on a boat, in a car or on a roller coaster — occurs when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses. Interestingly, adults 50 and older are less susceptible than younger adults and children, the CDC notes. Staying healthy: If you’re prone to going a little green when you travel, talk to your doctor ahead of your trip about medications that can help with symptoms. Prescription and over-the-counter ﻿antihistamines — like dimenhydrinate ﻿(﻿Dramamine), for example — are most frequently used to treat motion sickness. ﻿ However, antihistamines can interact with other medications and often cause drowsiness and decreased mental alertness, and the non﻿sedating ones appear to be less effective, the CDC says. Your doctor may also prescribe or recommend a patch that can help prevent nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness. Another tip: Have your physician review your current list of medications, since common pills — including some antidepressants and painkillers — can make seasickness worse, according to the CDC. ﻿ A few other things that can help with seasickness: Try lying down on your stomach, shutting your eyes or looking off into the horizon.Avoid the upper levels of the boat﻿.Stay hydrated and limit alcohol and caffeine﻿ consumption.Avoid smoking﻿. Even short-term cessation reduces your susceptibility to motion sickness, the CDC says﻿.Distract yourself with music, controlled breathing or aromatherapy (try mint or lavender). Sucking on a flavored lozenge (some experts recommend a hard ginger candy) may also help, the CDC says.While the CDC says the scientific data on acupressure for seasickness is lacking, it works for some. You can find wrist bands for motion sickness in many drugstores. 5. Burns and bites A word of advice from Lucar and Chen: Don’t forget the SPF when packing for your cruise. A burn on vacation can ruin your fun in the sun and put you at higher risk for skin cancer. “Also, if you’re going to places that have a lot of insects and mosquitoes, make sure you wear your insect repellent so that you don’t get a bunch of bites, because we also are worried about malaria, dengue, chikungunya, ﻿Zika — those sorts of things — at ports of call,” Chen says. Staying healthy: Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, the CDC recommends, and be sure your bottle says “blocks UVA and UVB” or “broad spectrum” on the label. When it comes to insect repellent, look for a spray that’s registered with the Environmental Protection Agency. Layering it with sunscreen? Put the repellent on second, over the sunscreen, the CDC advises. To ease any health-related concerns you might have before booking a cruise, Kwiatkowski suggests using a travel agent who is a cruise line expert or contacting the cruise line to ask about their cleaning protocols and track record. “I know it sounds like a lot of work,” she says, “but travel is a big investment, and you really want to travel worry﻿-free.”﻿﻿ Rachel Nania writes about health care and health policy for AARP.

If you have concerns, don’t put off the exam By Nsisong Asanga Updated April 29, 2025 Reviewed by Jessica K. Caldwell, Ph.D. Comments En español Published January 17, 2024 / Updated April 29, 2025 Teera Konakan / Getty Images Some forgetting is normal at any age. Everybody misplaces their keys, right? But for some people, confusion gets pronounced, and simple tasks such as managing money and driving become difficult without assistance.﻿ Although there is no vaccine or cure for dementia, early diagnosis is still crucial. Seeking help early and getting a diagnosis offer time to try therapies that may slow disease progression and relieve troublesome symptoms. Such actions also give the patient and family members time to anticipate care needs and plan financially. In the United States, more than 7 million people are living with dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. As the older population grows, those numbers are expected to rise sharply. The average age of onset is around 84 years. When it comes to diagnosis, “there’s no specific blood test or brain scan to tell if you have dementia. We often make the diagnosis by bedside testing,” says geriatric psychiatrist Karen Severson, M.D., based in Jupiter, Florida. She’s referring to simple questions a doctor might ask or short cognitive tests to check a person’s ability to recall and communicate, such as drawing a clock face. Although she uses the term “bedside testing,” these evaluations more often happen during a visit to the doctor’s office. Getting a dementia diagnosis Symptoms of Dementia Dementia shows up in many ways.

Blood samples may be taken to see whether the thyroid is working normally and to look for vitamin deficiencies. For one type of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, blood tests are becoming available. They measure proteins, such as beta-amyloid and tau, that are typical signs of Alzheimer’s. At present, blood tests are not enough to diagnose Alzheimer’s; they are considered with other evidence. They also don’t say anything about cognitive function.Cerebrospinal fluid tests. The fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord can be tested for the two Alzheimer’s-related proteins — beta-amyloid and tau — that can clump and form tangles.​Brain scans. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) look for changes in brain shape and size and patterns of altered brain activity that are common in dementia.Mental health evaluation. A psychiatrist may help pinpoint symptoms that may be treatable with medications or cognitive behavioral therapy. An evaluation could also rule out depression.Genetic tests.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/lasik-disqualifications/,"Can You Be Too Old for LASIK? 10 conditions that could disqualify you from getting this laser eye surgery By Lauren Evoy Davis, AARP Comments En español Published April 11, 2025 Getty Images Laser surgery to correct vision is the most common elective eye surgery — more than 800,000 people get it each year, according to the Refractive Surgery Council. People tend to have LASIK, short for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, between ages 20 and 40. But can older adults get this surgery, or do people age out of the option? “We never think of a hard, fast rule or cut off age-wise; the decision of who should have a type of elective refractive surgery is considered to be truly patient-specific, as long as they don't have any outstanding health conditions with their eyes,” says Michelle E. Andreoli, M.D., a clinical assistant professor of ophthalmology at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Although there’s no definitive age cut-off for LASIK, you must be at least 18 years old to have the procedure. To perform this type of refractive surgery, doctors use an ultraviolet laser to reshape the curvature of the cornea, the clear covering of the eye that refracts light. More effective for younger eyes Research scientists in Germany studied two groups of people who got LASIK surgery. One group included 341 people aged 55 and older, and the second group included 341 people between the ages of 30 and 40. They found that the safety for both groups was very similar, but it was not equally effective. After the surgery, the people in the older group had more nearsightedness, also called myopia, and worse clarity of vision, according to a 2024 article published in the journal Scientific Reports. The researchers found no difference in the effectiveness and safety of farsighted people. People tend to have more problems with their eyes as they age. So other eye conditions can certainly limit the success of the surgery, says Wuqaas M. Munir, M.D., associate professor of ophthalmology at the University of Maryland Medical System. Who should skip LASIK? Lasik is not for everyone. If you have one of these conditions, you might need to hang on to your glasses, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Many of these conditions become more common with age, making older eyes less likely to be good candidates for the surgery. 1. Certain autoimmune diseases These can include conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. People with arthritis can develop eye issues from inflammation. Lupus is associated with vision changes. Also, the medications used to treat some autoimmune disorders hamper the immune system, making healing a challenge. 2. Blepharitis This inflammation of the eyelids causes crusting of the eyelashes that increases risk of infection, so people with this condition aren’t good candidates for LASIK surgery, 3. Cataracts This condition causes clouding of the eye. You should wait to have LASIK until after you’ve had cataract surgery. 4. Diabetes This metabolic disease can also affect your sight. Although some people with well-controlled diabetes may be candidates, they may have a longer healing period. 5. Immunodeficiency conditions like HIV People with these conditions may not heal properly after surgery due to the conditions themselves or medications like steroids, which can slow healing. 6. Glaucoma This is a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve. Those with uncontrolled glaucoma are not a good candidates for LASIK. 7. Large pupils Depending on the size of your pupils, LASIK may not be recommended. 8. Migraines If you take sumatriptan (Imitrex) for migraines, you might be at risk for drug-induced conjunctivitis (pink eye). 9. Thin corneas Instead of LASIK, those with thin corneas might do better with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). In this procedure, the epithelium, the top surface of the eye, is removed rather than forming a flap, as is done with LASIK. 10. Dry eyes This condition, where your eyes don’t make enough tears, is common in people over 50. LASIK can make it worse. You would want to check with your doctor to see if you have any of these conditions or others that would make you less eligible, such as problems with your immune system. “They don't necessarily mean that you can't have the surgery, but there are risk factors for healing,” Munir says. Questions to ask before choosing a surgeon Ask your eye doctor to help you find a reliable surgeon. You will want to find someone who does the operation frequently, so it’s a good idea to ask how many years the surgeon has been performing the procedure. You can also ask what kind of laser they use to see if it’s the latest FDA-approved technology. The newest technology was released in 2018 and is called iDESIGN Refractive Studio, STAR Excimer Laser System. What to expect If you’re feeling nervous, the doctor can prescribe a sedative to take before the procedure, and you should have someone drive you to and from the surgery center. The doctor will seat you in a reclining chair, numb your eye, and use an instrument to hold your eye open during the half-hour surgery. The doctor will create a flap on the cornea using a laser to reshape it, thus correcting your vision. Many people have 20/20 vision or better after surgery. Once you are ready to go home, your doctor will give you goggles to wear while you sleep to protect your eyes from scratches. After the surgery, keep your hands away from your eyes. You shouldn’t shower until the next day. The American Academy of Ophthalmology warns that some people might have discomfort following the procedure that diminishes over time. This can include: Blurry visionDouble visionDry eyesEye painHalosLight sensitivityScratchiness Andreoli says typically the halos and dry eye side effects are worse for people over 50. You'll visit your eye doctor a day or two after the procedure to check your eyesight and assess the healing process. You may need touch-ups later People who get LASIK can enjoy better vision for a long time, but not forever, because laser surgery doesn’t prevent the eye from changing or aging, according to the Refractive Surgery Council. Some people need reading glasses several years after LASIK surgery. “The average LASIK patient in the United States can go about 10 to 15 years before they are slipping and starting to need distance glasses,” Andreoli says. One option is to get a touch-up. She cautions there may be some trade-offs to getting an enhancement. She adds that a touch-up may sharpen your eyesight for distance but may worsen your close-up sight. Cost considerations LASIK surgery can cost between $1,000 to $ 4,000, and insurance may not cover much, if any of the cost, because it is considered an elective surgery. If you’re still working and have a Flexible Spending Account or a Health Savings Account, you can use funds from those accounts for the surgery. Medicare considers this surgery elective and does not cover the cost but some Medicare Advantage might. You’d have to check with your provider about your case. Although insurance will not likely cover any of the cost, the surgery center may offer a warranty, which is worth asking about. Be wary of low-cost deals that seem too good to be true. In 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) refunded $1.1 million to consumers tricked by bait-and-switch advertising by LCA-vision. Advertisements for $300 procedures were actually priced between $1,000 and $2,295 per eye for the surgery. Patients were given the true cost estimate following an eye exam during an in-person consultation. When deciding whether LASIK is right for you, consider your overall health, cost, and long-term expectations.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/medications-that-harm-liver/,"10 Medications That Can Harm the Liver Your liver works hard to keep your body healthy, but certain medications may put it at risk By Goldina Erowele, AARP Reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published February 05, 2025 Pete Ryan Your liver is one of the hardest working organs in your body. It cleans your blood, helps digest food and keeps you healthy. But did you know that some common medications can make your liver sick? It’s a condition known as drug-induced liver injury, explains Udoka Ikezuagu, M.D., a hospitalist at Loma Linda University Medical Center in Murrieta, California. And while most medications are safe when taken as directed, older adults can be more sensitive to these risks, so it’s important to be aware and bring any concerns to your healthcare provider. Older individuals are also more likely to take multiple medications — roughly 40 percent of people 65 and older regularly take five or more prescription drugs, a Lown Institute report found — raising the risk of stress and damage to the liver. Here are 10 medications that in some instances can hurt the liver, plus ways to help protect it from damage. 1. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) What it is: Acetaminophen is a popular over-the-counter (OTC) medication for treating mild to moderate pain and reducing fever. Common names: Tylenol, Paracetamol (internationally) How it affects the liver: Acetaminophen is safe if you follow the directions and take the recommended amount, but it’s easy to overdo it, since it’s found in many combination medications, such as cold and flu remedies. Taking too much acetaminophen for a headache or muscle ache can be hard on your liver and cause harm. This risk goes up if you drink alcohol or already have a history of liver problems. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Always follow the label and don’t take more than the recommended amount. (According to the manufacturer, the daily dose limit is 3,250 milligrams (mg) for adults. However, some doctors may allow up to 4,000 mg per day.) Be sure to read the list of ingredients on all OTC medications, and talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist before using acetaminophen if you drink alcohol or have liver problems. 2. Statins What they are: Statins are prescription medications that lower cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease. Common names: Atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor) How they affect the liver: While generally safe and well tolerated, statins can raise liver enzymes, in particular one called ALT, or alanine aminotransferase. However, increases less than three times the upper limit of normal may not require your doctor to stop statin use. And enzyme levels go back to normal once you stop the medication. In rare cases, they can cause serious liver problems, especially if you already have issues with your liver. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Your healthcare provider may order blood tests to check your liver function while you take statins — not everyone requires one — and, if needed, make any necessary changes. Common blood tests to check liver function include: AST (aspartate aminotransferase): Normal range is 8 to 33 U/LALT (alanine aminotransferase): Normal range is 4 to 36 U/LALP (alkaline phosphatase): Normal range is 44 to 147 IU/LBilirubin: Normal range of total bilirubin is 0.1 to 1.2 mg/dL 3. Amoxicillin-clavulanate What it is: Amoxicillin-clavulanate, an antibiotic, treats a variety of bacterial infections. Common names: Augmentin How it affects the liver: Amoxicillin-clavulanate can sometimes harm the liver. Though the exact cause is unclear, research suggests it’s likely due to an allergic reaction caused by clavulanate. Liver problems can occur a few days to weeks after starting the medicine or even after finishing it. The risk increases with prolonged use and existing liver problems. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Watch out for yellow skin or eyes (jaundice), tiredness or dark-colored urine. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately. 4. Antiseizure medications What they are: These medications are used to prevent and treat seizures and certain types of nerve pain. Common names: Phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Tegretol) How they affect the liver: Antiseizure medications such as phenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) can prompt an abnormal immune response in the liver, called hypersensitivity syndrome, which can damage nearby tissues. Medications like valproic acid (Depakene) and lamotrigine (Lamictal), can also affect the liver. Tips to lower your risk of injury: If you are prescribed these medications, your healthcare provider may perform blood tests to check your liver health. Depending on test results, your provider may adjust your dose or switch you to a different medication. 5. Methotrexate What it is: Methotrexate is a prescription drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. Common names: Trexall, Rheumatrex How it affects the liver: Methotrexate can harm the liver, especially if taken for a long time or at high doses. (People taking the drug short-term may not be affected.) It may cause liver inflammation and, over time, lead to scarring (fibrosis) or serious liver disease (cirrhosis). The risk increases if you drink alcohol or already have liver problems. Tips to lower your risk of injury: If prescribed, your healthcare provider may test your liver with blood work and adjust your medication if needed. Discuss your treatment plan with your doctor, and avoid alcohol while taking this medication. 6. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) What they are: NSAIDs are over-the-counter medications used to treat pain, inflammation and fever. Common names: Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren) How they affect the liver: NSAIDs are usually safe for short-term use. However, taking them for a long time or at higher doses can put stress on the liver and, in some cases, cause liver damage. People with liver conditions or those taking multiple medications that affect liver function are at higher risk. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Before using NSAIDs, check with your healthcare provider. They may recommend starting with the lowest dose for the shortest time or may suggest an alternative. 7. Certain herbal and dietary supplements What they are: Herbal and dietary supplements are often marketed for various health benefits, but some can cause damage to the liver. Kava and black cohosh are two examples. Common names: Kava (Piper methysticum), black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) How they affect the liver: Kava is used for anxiety and insomnia and has been associated with serious liver damage, though the exact cause is unclear. Black cohosh, often used for menopause symptoms, has been linked to liver problems such as a rise in liver enzymes and liver failure. More than 30 cases of liver injury linked to these supplements have been reported in the U.S. Because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate or approve herbal or dietary supplements in the same way it does with other medications, ingredients in marketed products can vary, and some may contain harmful substances. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Be a savvy consumer and know that “natural” doesn’t always mean safe. Always talk to your doctor before using supplements, and avoid using these supplements if you have existing liver problems. 8. Antifungal medications What they are: Antifungals are a class of medications used to treat fungal infections in the skin, lungs and nails. Common names: Fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral) How they affect the liver: Antifungal medications like fluconazole and ketoconazole can harm the liver, but keep in mind these medications are often prescribed for short-term use. The effects can range from a mild rise in liver enzymes (which is generally not concerning and can be monitored), to inflammation and even liver failure in rare cases. Watch out for yellowing skin or eyes, tiredness or dark urine. Tips to lower your risk of injury: If you notice these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately. They may order blood tests and, if necessary, adjust your medication. 9. Amiodarone What it is: Amiodarone is a prescription for treating and preventing life-threatening irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). Common names: Cordarone, Pacerone How it affects the liver: Amiodarone can damage the liver, affecting up to 1 percent of people who take it every year. It can raise liver enzyme levels or, in rare cases, lead to liver scarring. The FDA has issued a boxed warning about the risk of liver injury with this medication. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Your healthcare provider will check liver enzyme levels before starting the medication and during treatment. 10. Isoniazid What it is: Isoniazid is an antibiotic used for treating tuberculosis (TB) and, in some cases, preventing it. Common names: INH, Nydrazid, Rifater How it affects the liver: Isoniazid is broken down by the liver and can cause liver damage. It causes mild inflammation to serious liver injury — especially in older adults, those with liver conditions, or those who drink alcohol. It also has an FDA-boxed warning about liver inflammation risk, particularly when combined with certain medications. Tips to lower your risk of injury: Your healthcare provider may check the health of your liver with lab tests. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience nausea, vomiting, yellow skin or eyes, or dark urine. Risk factors for liver damage Some factors can raise the risk of liver damage from medications, including: A history of liver issuesFrequent alcohol useTaking multiple medications Working closely with your healthcare provider and pharmacist can help protect your liver. They may check your liver health and adjust your treatment if needed, says Jessica Njoku, a pharmacist with Harris Health System in Houston. To help protect your liver, take your medications exactly as prescribed, Ikezuagu says, and never change your dose without talking to your healthcare provider first. What’s more, be sure to talk to your doctor before mixing prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and supplements.

By Jessica Migala with Sari Harrar, Ginny Graves, Nicole Pajer and Beth Howard, AARP Comments En español Published May 18, 2023 ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHRISTINE RÖSCH When it comes to weight, your 60s are a pivotal decade. A full 41.5 percent of adults age 60 and older are considered obese, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With age, your body accumulates more fat and deposits more of it around your middle, while at the same time you’re losing muscle, all of which introduces higher odds for developing a cadre of health problems — high blood pressure and cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and a decline in physical functioning. Your weight isn’t everything, but it can indicate how much body fat you’re carrying. And body fat isn’t just benign, sleepy stuff; it acts as an endocrine organ that’s involved in the metabolism of sex hormones, blood clotting and blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity. Hitting that sweet spot — not too much, not too little — is important for aging well. Doctors use the BMI scale (body mass index) as one measure of body fat to determine whether you’re underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese. (Find yours at aarp.org/bmi.) In the general population, a BMI of less than 18.5 is considered underweight; 18.5 to 24.9 is healthy weight; 25 to 29.9 is overweight; and 30 and over is obese, with a BMI of 40 or higher indicating severe obesity. But those numbers might not apply so clearly to people in their 60s. One 2022 study found that the best BMI for health for those over age 65 is 27 to 28 in men and 31 to 32 for women. This is referred to as the obesity paradox, and exactly why it exists isn’t fully understood, says Kristen DeCarlo, M.D., a geriatrician who practices in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at UI Health in Chicago. That doesn’t mean you should ignore weight gain. Consider your weight one indicator of your health, along with your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. But pay attention to where you’re carrying those pounds too. “Visceral fat is the fat that’s hidden in your abdominal cavity,” says Jean-Pierre Després, a professor in the department of kinesiology at Université Laval in Quebec City, Quebec. More visceral fat means more than just a wider waistline; it means a higher risk for heart disease, diabetes and stroke. What’s happening to my body in my 60s? “Our bodies are different in our 60s from when we were in our 20s and 30s,” says Gitanjali Srivastava, M.D., medical director of Vanderbilt Obesity Medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. 1. You may still be gaining fat The fat gain you experienced in your 50s may continue into your 60s. “For reasonably healthy adults, there’s a natural increase in body fat until your 80s,” says DeCarlo. Hormonal changes and medication side effects, coupled with muscle loss and fat gain, add up to a body that now carries around proportionally more fat. 2. Your muscles need protection It’s generally believed that every pound lost through diet is about 75 percent fat and 25 percent muscle, says DeCarlo. If your doctor has advised you to lose weight, the key is to hold on to as much muscle as you can. Do that by consuming 15 to 25 percent of your daily calories from protein and regularly participating in both aerobic exercise (150 minutes a week of walking, biking, jogging or swimming) and resistance exercise (weight lifting at least twice a week). You may lose as much as 3 percent of your overall muscle strength every year in your 60s. Men tend to hold on to more of their muscle power longer; for women, the decline happens quickly after age 65. 3. Your metabolism is on the fritz This is the decade when metabolism is starting to sputter. Your metabolism — or the rate your body burns calories — remains pretty stable in your adult years until your 60s. A 2021 study in Science identified “the break point”: age 63, after which metabolism begins to decline. Your body requires fewer calories to keep it working (your heart beating, your lungs breathing); having less muscle also contributes to a more sluggish engine. 4. Your waistline doesn’t lie There’s a cheap and easy way to get an idea of how much of the concerning visceral fat (as opposed to subcutaneous fat — more on this shortly) is setting up shop in your belly: Measure your waistline. Men should be under 40 inches; women should be less than 35 inches. Also, check your pants. The butt may be baggier but the waist tighter. “How your pants fit can be an accurate indicator of visceral fat,” says Srivastava. 5. Menopause has left a mark By the time a woman is postmenopausal, 15 to 20 percent of her body fat is visceral fat, compared with just 5 to 8 percent when she was premenopausal. These changes are associated with higher blood pressure, cholesterol, insulin resistance and inflammation, according to a 2022 review at Columbia University. 6. Your neck may be getting thicker Are the collars on your button-ups too tight? It’s not the dry cleaner’s doing. As we age, our muscles loosen and become laxer, and “there can be more fat deposition in areas near the base of the tongue,” says Srivastava. A neck size greater than 16 inches for women or 17 for men, she says, can be a sign that you’re carrying excess fat in the neck, which can put you at risk for conditions like sleep apnea. Why visceral fat is bad for you As you age, the fat underneath your skin begins to reroute into your abdomen, where it becomes visceral fat, says Srivastava. Visceral fat is the deeper fat that lives within your belly and hugs your stomach, liver and intestines. Your butt, legs, arms and face may appear thinner, but more visceral fat equals a wider waistline, and that distribution matters: “Visceral fat is the more dangerous fat to have,” she says. When Austrian scientists scanned the bellies of 10,894 people for a 2020 study, they found that 20-year-olds had on average less than a pound of visceral fat. It surged to over 2 pounds for women and 4 pounds for men by their 60s. While many of us monitor our weight out of vanity, doctors suggest you consider monitoring your weight, BMI and waist measurement as important as monitoring your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. If they get out of control, you may be in danger. When scientists tracked 190,672 adults for 10 years or longer, obesity boosted the risk for heart attacks, strokes and heart failure — and nearly tripled the odds for the most obese middle-aged group. Even those without obesity can be at increased risk from visceral fat, says Morgana Mongraw-Chaffin, assistant professor of epidemiology and prevention at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She conducted a study of 1,005 midlife women and men, none of whom had obesity. But those with higher levels of abdominal fat raised their risk for diabetes by 51 percent and doubled their risk for metabolic syndrome — a collection of risk factors including low levels of heart-helping HDL cholesterol, high levels of ticker-menacing triglycerides, and above-normal blood pressure and/or blood sugar. The good thing about visceral fat is that you can lose it quickly. One study found that just four weeks of brisk walking resulted in an inch reduction in waist circumference. “With exercise, you can lose visceral fat even if you don’t lose weight” says Després. Reducing your waist size by about 1.5 inches can reduce the risk for diabetes by 60 percent. Weight, cancer and immunity There’s another common killer that becomes more prevalent as we reach our 60s: cancer. Rates increase from about 350 cases per 100,000 people in those ages 45 to 49 to more than 1,000 per 100,000 people in those 60 and older. One reason, according to the National Institutes of Health, is the decline in the immune system’s ability to detect and correct cell defects. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity is linked to at least 13 types of cancer. Some are hormone-related: Obesity creates inflammation, which disrupts the immune system, and causes dysregulation of the hormonal system. “Obesity leads to an increase in certain hormones that lead to an increase in cancer: breast, endometrial, thyroid, pancreas and so forth,” says Omar Ghanem, M.D., a metabolic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “Those connections are well established, and we know that losing weight with bariatric surgery can reduce the risk,” he says. Bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce cancers that aren’t related to hormone levels. In a recent analysis of 15 studies, including a total of nearly 950,000 people with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery and more than 17 million who didn’t, the researchers found that the surgery group had an almost 50 percent reduction in the risk of liver, colorectal, kidney, urinary tract, esophageal and lung cancers. Obesity is also a risk factor for developing an autoimmune disease, a problem that becomes more common with age, particularly in women. These diverse conditions, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, occur when the immune system starts attacking the body’s own healthy tissues. “People with rheumatoid arthritis in particular have premature immune aging,” says Cornelia Weyand, M.D., an immune system researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “Their immune age is about 25 years older than their actual age.” The last three years have driven home how obesity can impact the immune system. Researchers recently looked at how weight affected outcomes for some 150,000 COVID patients. They learned that patients with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 (just above the “obesity” threshold) were 7 percent more likely to be hospitalized and 8 percent more likely to die than people who were a healthy weight. Those with a BMI of 45 or higher (considered “morbidly” obese) were 33 percent more likely to be hospitalized and 61 percent more likely to die. But the immune system can rebound if you bring your weight under control. A 2022 study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital of people with obesity who lost 18 percent of their body weight after weight-loss surgery revealed that within just three months, the patients’ immune systems were measurably healthier, with reduced white blood cell levels and reduced inflammation. How we think about weight Conventional wisdom once said that “feeling fat” was strictly a young person’s problem. Now a wave of research is uncovering long-overlooked struggles — and newfound wisdom — about weight and body image for people in their 60s. “It’s not like you grow out of a negative body image,” says psychologist and body image researcher Lisa Kilpela, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. “There are a lot of reasons to suspect it could get worse with age for some people.” ""It’s not like you grow out of a negative body image. There are a lot of reasons to suspect it could get worse with age for some people."" Lisa Kilpela, psychologist and body image researcher Over half of women in their 60s say weight or body shape concerns have a negative impact on their lives. In one large University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill survey, up to 64 percent thought about their weight every day. Men aren’t exempt. Half in a small Canadian study of men ages 60 to 83 said they felt unattractive because of their weight. Body dissatisfaction made 17 percent of men and 39 percent of women ages 50 to 65 uncomfortable wearing a bathing suit in public, according to a UCLA survey of over 52,000 U.S. adults. But in your 60s, a negative body image can have far more serious consequences: Binge﻿-eating was a problem for up to 26 percent of women ages 55 to 83 in a recent study by Kilpela and others. “For the longest time, people didn’t think older women had eating disorders,” Kilpela says. “Older women who come to our lab say things like, ‘Thank you for thinking of us. We thought we’d be the forgotten ones because of our age.’ ” Body dissatisfaction is associated with higher risk of depression, poorer sleep and less than optimal self-care. “It’s like the way you treat an old pair of sneakers versus a brand-new pair,” says Kilpela. Of course, not everyone in their 60s battles big-time body dissatisfaction, says psychiatrist Debra Safer, M.D., an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who specializes in treating eating and weight disorders. In a study of body image and “fat talk” in women ages 18 to 87, just 12 percent of those 61 and older said they harangued themselves frequently about their weight — the lowest number of any age category in the study. “Self-compassion is the antidote,” Safer says. “Compassion for all your body has allowed you to do and still enables you to do.” CHRISTINE RÖSCH 6 Most Effective Weight-Loss Steps to Take in Your 60s Eat less, move more. Losing weight comes down to just those four words, right? Not really. Decades of research show that effective weight loss involves food choices as much as, if not more than, food volume. And certain lifestyle choices significantly affect success or failure. These six steps are widely accepted as key to effective weight loss. 1. Start your day with protein Studies show that “protein timing”—﻿ eating 25 to 30 grams of protein in the morning, and the same amount at lunch and dinner—helps people at midlife and beyond maintain muscle mass, which in turn reduces fat gain. This is the basis of AARP’s New York Times bestseller The Whole Body Reset. The average American currently eats about 10 grams at breakfast and about 60 grams at dinner. 2. Choose farm foods over factory foods That means fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, seafood, olive and avocado oils, low-fat dairy and lean meat throughout the day. The fewer processed foods, the better. Foods in their natural form are the basis of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which are consistently rated as the best programs for weight management, heart health and longevity. 3. Move at least 30 minutes a day Daily active living beats a few weekly gym sessions and sitting around the rest of the time. Aim for a total of at least 150 minutes of movement per week — walking swimming, biking, gardening — for cardiovascular fitness, and at least two days a week of resistance training for muscular strength, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 4. Cut down on simple carbohydrates, especially sugar That means minimizing cookies, sodas and other sweets. Simple carbs not only fill you up with calories while providing minimal nutrition, but a higher carbohydrate intake leads to water retention, making you look, feel and weigh heavier. 5. Stop eating at 7 p.m. Eating later in the evening increases your next-day hunger, decreases your next-day calorie burn and triggers your body to store more fat, according to a recent study. 6. Go to bed at least seven hours before you need to wake up Ghrelin is the hormone created in the stomach that signals us to eat. Sleeping less than seven hours a night has been shown to elevate ghrelin, meaning you may be driven to consume more calories the next day. ""It’s not like you grow out of a negative body image.

Health officials are predicting that the 2024-2025 respiratory illness season will be similar to last year’s, possibly even better. “That being said, there are a lot of assumptions that go into a projection,” Center﻿s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Mandy Cohen, M.D., said at an August press briefing. “If those assumptions prove wrong, say, for example, the number of people who ultimately get vaccinated against flu, COVID-19 and RSV is lower than expected, then that could mean more hospitalizations, not fewer.” Newly updated COVID-19 vaccines were recently approved and are making their way to pharmacies and clinics nationwide. Flu shots for the 2024-2025 are also starting to become available and are especially important for older adults who are at higher risk for getting seriously ill if infected. The CDC estimates that between 70 and 85 percent of flu-related deaths in the United States occur among adults 65 and older, and as many as 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations happen to people in this age group. “Influenza is a serious illness, and people need to be thinking of it as such,” says Mark Rupp, M.D., a professor and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. But often people don’t think of flu as being as serious as some other diseases, says Kathleen Linder, M.D. a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases at Michigan Medicine. “I think part of the challenge is that people use the word ‘flu’ to mean a lot of different illnesses,” Linder says. “You hear people talk about the stomach flu, which isn't influenza at all. And I think it's just important to remember that influenza proper can be very, very dangerous. Some of the sickest patients that we see in our ICU are people who have influenza.” Research shows the flu vaccine can lower your risk of hospitalization and death from influenza. Rupp says that on an average year, “there's somewhere around 25,000 deaths in the United States due to influenza that can be very much diminished at risk by getting an influenza vaccine.” Here’s what you need to know about getting the shot this year. 1. The vaccine targets three influenza viruses Similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, the composition of the flu vaccine is updated each year to target stains of the influenza virus that health officials expect will be circulating. This year’s flu shot will be trivalent, meaning it will protect against three different influenza viruses, including H1N1, H3N2 and a B/Victoria lineage virus. The vaccine was found to reduce the risk of hospitalization from flu in high-risk individuals by 35 percent during the southern hemisphere’s 2024 flu season, which typically runs April through September, a new report from the CDC shows. The researchers note that the vaccine’s effectiveness could be similar in the northern hemisphere if similar flu strains circulate during its flu season (October through May). 2. Older adults need a high-dose version There are different flu vaccine options available, and for people under 65, health officials don’t recommend any licensed vaccine over another. However, adults 65-plus should choose one of the higher-dose vaccines available, the CDC says. The high-dose shots are: Fluzone high-dose vaccineFlublok recombinant flu vaccineFluad adjuvanted flu vaccine “The issue is that as people get older, their immunologic response is not as robust as younger, healthier people,” Rupp says. ﻿ ﻿In order to account for this, he says, you can either get a flu vaccine with a higher antigen level —﻿ a marker that tells the body's immune system that something is harmful ﻿— or that includes an ingredient called adjuvant, which stimulates the immune system to create a stronger immune response. “Both of them are ways in which you can get older people to have an appropriate amount of protection,” Rupp says. These higher-dose shots may result in more of the temporary, mild side effects that you’d expect from a standard-dose flu vaccine, the CDC says. Common side effects from the flu shot can include: Pain, redness or swelling at the injection siteHeadacheFeverNauseaMuscle acheFatigue Vaccine side effects typically disappear after a few days and are normal signs that the body is building protection. 3. It’s best to be vaccinated by the end of October The best time to get the flu vaccine is in September or October, the CDC says. If you get it too early, say in July or August, you “might run out of immunity by the end of the season,” Linder says. Flu season in the United States typically stretches from October to February, though activity can last as late as May, according to the CDC. It takes about two weeks after you are vaccinated for immunity to fully set in. 4. You can get your flu shot with COVID-19 and RSV vaccines Like last year, the advice from experts this fall is that the flu and COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same appointment, so there’s no need to make two separate trips to the pharmacy or doctor’s office. You can also get your flu shot with an RSV vaccine, which is recommended just one time for everyone 75 and older and people 60 to 74 with certain health conditions. If you’re due for all three vaccines, it’s fine to get them all at once, the CDC says. You can find flu, COVID-19 and RSV shots near you at vaccines.gov.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/how-much-water-should-you-drink-a-day/,"Do You Really Need 8 Glasses of Water a Day? Accumulating research shows that staying hydrated is important for older adults abu hasan ahmad / Getty Images By Kimberly Goad, AARP En español Published February 08, 2023 Ask any adult how many 8-ounce glasses of water they’re supposed to drink per day and they’ll probably deliver the one-word answer before you’ve had a chance to get the question out: eight.﻿ Not seven. Not nine. Eight. That’s the number that took hold in 1945 when the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council made its official recommendation for water intake. Though hidden within a more complex equation, the recommendation translated to roughly 64 ounces a day. And it referred to a person’s total daily water intake — not just pure water but also the amount taken in from foods and other beverages — though it was widely misinterpreted to mean that everybody, everywhere should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of plain water every day. Up for debate in the decades since: Do you really need that much? The answer isn’t so simple. “There are many factors that affect water needs and hydration status, such as body size, climate, activity and metabolic rate, etc., so water needs may differ from one individual to another and even for the same person under different circumstances,” says Paul Jacques, a senior scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center for Aging at Tufts University. Although the eight-glasses rule is an easy recommendation to remember, depending on how it’s interpreted, it might not meet the current recommendations for total water intake (meaning water contained in other beverages counts), which is 13 cups per day for men and nine cups a day for women, Jacques says. If you include water content from food, that number is even higher. The health-hydration connection Though experts may not agree on the precise amount of water we should drink to meet the total daily DRI (or dietary reference intake) for overall water consumption, this much is clear: Staying hydrated is a big deal. “You might think that since your body has so much water — more than 50 percent — it shouldn’t make a difference, even if you lose some,” says Stavros Kavouras, a professor of nutrition and director of the Hydration Science Lab at Arizona State University. “However, the data suggest that even a 1 to 2 percent water deficit is enough to lower exercise performance, impair cognitive function and worsen cardiovascular function.” That’s not all. A new study from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that adults who aren’t sufficiently hydrated may age faster, face a higher risk of chronic diseases — such as lung disease, diabetes, heart failure and stroke — and be more likely to die younger than those who stay well-hydrated. The results are based on 30 years’ worth of data collected from more than 11,000 adults in the U.S. who were 45 to 66 years old when the study began. The researchers looked at levels of sodium in the participants’ blood to determine hydration (higher concentrations are a sign that they most likely weren’t consuming enough fluids) and found that those with blood-sodium levels at the higher end of the normal range had aged faster than those at the lower end of the range. “While more research is needed, the main theory regarding the mechanism by which hydration status might affect health and aging is through elevated levels of antidiuretic hormone,” Jacques says. That’s the hormone “that helps regulate total body water by [controlling] water excretion in the kidneys and by stimulating thirst.” If you’re underhydrated, that hormone is elevated, he says. Exacerbating the problem: Research shows we tend to drink less as we age. One study published in 2019 in the journal SAGE Open Nursing suggests that up to 40 percent of older adults may be chronically underhydrated. The obvious culprits: Certain medications, such as diuretics, may negatively affect water balance, plus some older adults may intentionally reduce their water intake because of incontinence or other concerns about bladder control. What’s more, the sensation of thirst tends to decline with age. “When you’re younger, you get thirsty and you get something to drink, but older people in the same situation don’t feel thirst,” says Rosanne Leipzig, M.D., professor of medicine in the Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and author of Honest Aging. “It’s unclear why, but it has amazing repercussions.” Staying hydrated Generally speaking, eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, “even though it was not originally developed based on scientific data, is very close to what we need,” Kavouras says. Of course, lifestyle, climate and overall health play a role, he adds. “You will not have the same water needs if you train five hours a day in the middle of the summer, vers﻿us having a fairly sedentary lifestyle in the winter, but eight glasses a day is a good goal for most people.” How do you know if you’re not properly hydrated? Look for warning signs such as dry mouth, sluggishness and dizziness. Another indication: if you're going to the bathroom two to three times a day (and not every two to three hours) and producing urine that has a strong odor and looks more like apple juice than lemonade. To help remedy the situation, aim to eat more foods with high water content. For instance, cantaloupe, strawberries, watermelon, lettuce, celery, spinach and cooked squash are all at least 90 percent water; yogurt, apples, grapes, oranges, carrots, pears, pineapples and cooked broccoli are 80 to 89 percent water. “Hydration is a big deal — especially for older adults,” says Roopa Anmolsingh, M.D., with the Cleveland Clinic Center for Geriatric Medicine. “As a geriatrician, I would advise older people to discuss with their primary care providers what their individualized recommended daily water intake should be.” Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

But this winter, there’s a fourth bug that’s also bringing misery to the masses: Outbreaks of norovirus, a gastrointestinal affliction, are surging too, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. The convergence of all four has spawned the nickname the “quad-emic.” An uptick in any of these viral illnesses is not unexpected this time of year, health experts say. Cases of flu, COVID and RSV (short for respiratory syncytial virus) tend to start climbing in the fall and peak in the winter months. Currently, emergency room visits for flu and RSV are high and continue to increase, the latest CDC data shows. Norovirus cases also tend to creep up in the cold-weather months, even though you can catch the nasty stomach bug any time of year, says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. However this year, “we appear to be having, across the country, a more substantial winter increase of norovirus,” Schaffner says. According to the CDC, reported norovirus outbreaks for the 2024-2025 season are the highest they have been in 12 years. Edward Liu, M.D., chief of infectious diseases at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, says we don’t have a clear understanding as to why norovirus cases are especially high this year. It could be that more people are clustering together this winter, he says. (Norovirus is highly contagious and can spread quickly and easily from person to person.) A new strain of the virus could also be to blame, since “newer strains generally circulate more widely until things tamp down,” Schaffner adds. Video: CDC Director Explains Why Older Adults Should Protect Against RSV Quad-emic is a threat to older adults Age-related changes that impact the immune system — plus underlying chronic health issues that become more common with age — put older adults at higher risk for serious complications from respiratory illnesses such as COVID, flu and RSV, the CDC says. Warning signs of severe illness with these infections can include trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, and dizziness or confusion, among others. Similarly, older adults are among those at higher risk for complications from a norovirus infection. The virus causes around 900 deaths in the U.S. each year, and most are among adults aged 65 and older, the CDC says. The concern with norovirus, which brings on vomiting and diarrhea, is dehydration, Schaffner says. “Deaths associated with norovirus usually are a consequence of dehydration and also loss of control of chronic underlying illnesses,” he says. Older adults are more vulnerable to dehydration, research shows, since the amount of water in our bodies decreases with age. Decreased kidney function can also affect fluid levels in older bodies, the Cleveland Clinic says. Signs of dehydration can include decreased urination, dry mouth and throat, fatigue, and feeling dizzy when standing up, according to the CDC. What’s more, weakness caused by days of nausea and vomiting with a norovirus infection can put older adults at higher risk for falls, Liu says. And falls are the leading cause of injury among adults 65-plus. Video: CDC Director Explains Why Older Adults Should Protect Against RSV Staying healthy during a quad-emic Just because there’s a lot of illness swirling about this winter, doesn’t mean you’re destined to spend the season sick. There are vaccines that can protect against severe illness for COVID, flu and RSV, and health officials recommend that older adults get them. (No, it's not too late to get the shots if you skipped them this fall, doctors say.) Masks can also help thwart an infection from influenza, COVID and RSV, Schaffner says, since they are spread mainly by way of respiratory droplets that are made when people exhale, cough, talk or sneeze. When it comes to norovirus, hand washing is key, Liu says, since the virus spreads through contaminated food, water or surfaces, where it can survive for days, even weeks. And it’s best to skip the hand sanitizer and stick to soap and water, since sanitizers are not very effective against norovirus, Schaffner says. Folks who are more susceptible to severe illness from any of these bugs may also want to consider social distancing during the current outbreak. “Stream the movie rather than going to the movie,” Schaffner says. And watch yourself around the grandkids if they have been sick, since “it's very easy to pass [these illnesses] from the grandkids to grandparents,” Liu says. The good news: Just like spikes in virus activity are expected in the winter, lulls are expected in the spring. “Generally, we see less of it once it starts to warm up,” Liu says.

Frankie Alduino Catherine Lydon Mesa remembers feeling like she had been hit by a train on a Saturday evening in September 2022. “I was shaking so much from a fever that I had my hand under my chin to keep my teeth from clattering so loud,” recalls Mesa, now 61. In the days that followed, she struggled to catch her breath, was tortured with headaches, and was so weak that she had to crawl from her bed to the bathroom. “I couldn’t even stand up,” says Mesa, who lives in Queens, New York. Sitting in her bed to eat a bowl of soup would exhaust her. The diagnosis: COVID-19, an illness that she had managed to avoid for more than two years since it first started spreading in the U.S. in early 2020. Given an underlying health condition — Mesa was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, in her 20s — she did what she could to lower her risks of getting infected with the coronavirus. She was vaccinated, boosted and wore a mask in public. Still, the virus eventually found her, and it made her really sick — just like it’s done to millions of older adults. It’s been five years since COVID-19 arrived in the U.S., and in that time, adults age 50 and older have accounted for roughly 94 percent of the 1.2-plus million American deaths. And while hospitalizations are fewer now than they were earlier in the pandemic, the illness is still sending thousands to inpatient wards and wings, and the vast majority are older individuals, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. Why COVID hits older adults so hard Biological changes that develop with age are a big reason why older adults have borne — and continue to bear — the burden of this disease. When you’re older, the immune system cannot fight off foreign invaders as well as it could in your younger years, explains Emily Landon, M.D., executive medical director for infection prevention and control and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine. “And as we get older, your body isn’t as quick or as good at recognizing when something’s wrong.” What’s more, older individuals are more likely to have underlying health conditions, like heart disease or lung disease. And when you pile on an infection, “those medical problems leave you at a disadvantage,” Landon says. An estimated 85 percent of Americans 65 and older have at least one chronic health condition, research suggests, and more than half have two. A 2021 study led by federal researchers found that diabetes and obesity were among the leading risk factors for death from COVID-19. An estimated 1 in 3 U.S. adults 65 and older have diabetes, and more than 40 percent of adults 60 and older have obesity. ‘We had tons of patients’ Anthony W. Okolo, M.D., was a second-year medical resident practicing in the Bronx in early 2020. “I remember when we started hearing a lot about COVID, it came in waves of intensity — that’s the best way I would describe it,” says Okolo, now a hospitalist and geriatrician at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. At first, he recalls chatter about the outbreak abroad; then the virus was in the U.S. “And then the hospital became a full-blown COVID treatment hospital,” he says. Patients were filling the beds, and many of them were older individuals. In Chicago, it was a similar scene. “We had tons of patients,” Landon says. “At one point, almost 50 percent of our hospital was just COVID patients. I mean, it was unbelievable.” By mid-April 2020, about a month after lockdowns started, the hospitalization rate for adults 65 and older was 30.7 per 100,000 people, according to CDC data. For adults under the age of 50, the rate was much lower at 5.1 per 100,000. “We didn’t have any native immunity whatsoever,” Landon says about the coronavirus in 2020. That has changed with the development of vaccines and with ongoing infections. Still, the virus continues to prey on older adults. In early January 2025, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate for adults under 50 was 1.0 per 100,000 people; for individuals 65-plus, it was 18.3. COVID’s lingering effects It’s not just the initial infection that disproportionately impacts the older population. Some research suggests that COVID-19 is more likely to linger in older people, leaving them with new or persistent symptoms — a phenomenon known as long COVID. A CDC study found that 1 in 4 adults age 65-plus have developed at least one long-term health issue as a result of COVID-19. Another large study published in the journal BMJ found almost 1 in 3 adults over the age of 65 sought medical care for new or ongoing COVID symptoms weeks after their initial illness. Mesa, the Queens resident who caught COVID in 2022, is one of them. About a month after she first got sick with COVID-19, she went to see her physician for an unyielding cough and prolonged exhaustion. Her doctor suspected it was long COVID but wanted to give her a little more time to see if the symptoms cleared. Sometimes it takes longer for people with underlying health conditions to return to normal, Mesa was told. Mesa gets a moment of respite in her bedroom. Frankie Alduino She hoped by the four-month mark, she would feel better. “That’s not what happened,” says Mesa, who was diagnosed with long COVID and is now a patient advocate for Solve M.E.'s Long COVID Patient Leadership Advancement Network. More than two years after her run-in with COVID-19, she still struggles with its effects. Everyday tasks like showering and driving can be strenuous. Going out to dinner with friends will wipe her out for the following two days. A simple trip upstairs, “and the coughing fits come on again,” Mesa says. She’s seen some improvement in her long COVID symptoms with medications, therapies and changes to her routine, but she’s still not back to her pre-pandemic self. Nonetheless, she says she feels “beyond fortunate” and tries to focus on what she can do rather than what she can’t. “I also have a tremendous amount of gratitude because I was so sick, I feel that I was spared for a reason,” Mesa says. Mesa gets a moment of respite in her bedroom. Frankie Alduino The Next 5 Years of COVID Living with long COVID Millions of people suffer from long COVID, and many of them are older adults. Some of the most common symptoms older adults experience include: Extreme tiredness or lack of energy (fatigue) Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Coughing Joint pain and weakness High blood pressure Changes in smell or taste Difficulty thinking, concentrating and remembering (brain fog) Source: National Institute on Aging These days, we’re better able to disrupt COVID’s destruction, in large part because of scientific advances made in the past five years. Vaccines developed at record speed help keep mild infections from turning severe. One report from the Commonwealth Fund found that the shots averted 18.5 million additional hospitalizations and 3.2 million additional deaths between December 2020 and November 2022 alone. At-home tests that can alert you to an infection and prescription antiviral treatments to treat it have also helped turn the pandemic tides. “The medicines we have available for COVID right now are really good, but if you don’t know if you have COVID, then you can’t get the medicine,” Landon says, highlighting the importance of the nasal-swab test kits. However, with COVID here to stay, there’s more work to do in our ongoing fight against the virus. Many doctors and researchers say vaccine acceptance is key to our continued success. Roughly 23 percent of the U.S. adult population received the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. The share is higher among older adults, but not by much — an estimated 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had received the most recent COVID-19 vaccine as of November 2024, according to federal data. “I think because we remember so acutely what the pandemic was like, and to not be in a state where we’re hearing sirens going off all hours of the day can have us lower our guard a little bit,” says Amanda K. Johnson, M.D., senior assistant vice president of care models in the Office of Ambulatory Care and Population Health for NYC Health + Hospitals. “But getting vaccinated is important for you, and it’s important for your loved ones.” It’s possible we could see a combination flu-COVID vaccine in the next few years, which public health experts say could help boost vaccination rates. “For some folks, it is one or the other,” Johnson says. Making headway with long COVID treatments is another goal for researchers in the forthcoming years. “There’s not the research base to tell us exactly how to treat and manage that condition just yet, and so I’m hoping that now that we’re out of the emergency response mode, we don’t lose sight of the millions of Americans who are still suffering and living with long COVID,” Johnson says. ﻿ An estimated 6 percent of U.S. adults have long COVID, according to a CDC study, and a significant share of them (about 20 percent) say the illness limits their ability to carry out daily activities. “I just think that anything that anybody can do, no matter how big, how small, is a step in the right direction to helping the overall [long COVID] community﻿,” Mesa says. It may feel like the pandemic is behind us, but the public health community isn’t letting it fade too far in the rearview mirror. Now and in the years to come, they’re taking lessons from our experiences with COVID and preparing for future outbreaks — be it with the coronavirus or an entirely new pathogen. “It’s so hard to imagine that we are five years out from the beginnings of the pandemic, but I’m hoping that people bear in mind that this is the kind of event that has happened before, and it’s possible that it could happen again in our lifetimes,” Johnson says. Okolo adds, “We don’t know what’s coming next. We don’t know if we’ll ever have another pandemic to that scale, but I think what we can learn from COVID in real-time is the importance of having protocols and playbooks in place for if and when such an incident should happen again.” Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID Living with long COVID Millions of people suffer from long COVID, and many of them are older adults.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/hand-sanitizer/,"7 Things to Know About Hand Sanitizer When to use it, how it works and why you shouldn't make it at home Getty Images By: Rachel Nania, AARP En español Published June 12, 2020 One of the best ways to prevent a coronavirus infection is to wash your hands with soap and water — and when soap and water aren't available, public health experts say alcohol-based hand sanitizer is the next best option. But just how effective are gels and sprays when it comes to getting rid of dangerous germs, such as the coronavirus? Here are seven things you should know about hand sanitizer. 1. Hand sanitizer kills germs but doesn't clean your hands Soap and water reign supreme when it comes to infection control, but believe it or not, soap and water do not kill germs; they remove them. The duo's effectiveness boils down to the mechanics of handwashing. The rubbing and scrubbing of soap between your palms and fingers creates friction that breaks down the structure of the bacteria and loosens the germs from your skin, explains Maryanne McGuckin, an infection prevention specialist and author of The Patient Survival Guide: 8 Simple Solutions to Prevent Hospital- and Healthcare-Associated Infections. When you rinse your hands under water, you wash those germs down the drain. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, on the other hand, do kill germs on the skin — most germs, anyway. Hand sanitizer is less effective at killing Cryptosporidium, norovirus and Clostridium difficile, all of which cause diarrhea, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says. Scientists suspect hand sanitizer does, however, kill the coronavirus. Hand sanitizers also don't work as well if your hands are visibly dirty or greasy, and they may not remove harmful chemicals such as pesticides and heavy metals like lead. 2. Sanitizer trumps soap and water in certain situations Is Your Hand Sanitizer Safe? Is Your Hand Sanitizer Safe? Because handwashing — when done properly — is better at getting rid of germs and grime, hand sanitizer, for the most part, should be used as a backup to soap and water. “The time to use hand sanitizer is when you can't get to a sink and some clean water and a clean towel,” says Elaine Larson, professor emerita of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and a scholar in residence at New York Academy of Medicine. That said, the CDC recommends using hand sanitizer as a first choice in certain situations, such as before and after visiting a friend or loved one in a hospital or nursing home. (That's why you'll often see dispensers posted directly outside patient rooms.) A squirt of hand sanitizer on your way in and out reduces the likelihood you'll introduce a dangerous bug or leave with one. It's also a good idea to use hand sanitizer regularly when interacting with people who have weakened immune systems, Larson says. 3. Not all hand sanitizers are equal To kill most disease-causing germs, the CDC recommends using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Anything less than that may not work as well “for many types of germs,” and could “merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright,” the CDC says. When searching the shelves, you may come across hand sanitizers that contain benzalkonium chloride instead of alcohol. These products, however, are not recommended by the CDC, since “available evidence indicates benzalkonium chloride has less reliable activity against certain bacteria and viruses” compared to alcohol-based sanitizers. 4. Sanitizing technique matters Hand sanitizer works best when used correctly. Apply the recommended amount to the palm of your hand (make sure it's enough to cover the entire surface of both hands) and distribute the sanitizer all over, paying special attention to the fingertips, “because that's where you touch most other things,” Larson says. Continue rubbing the hand sanitizer into your hands until your skin is completely dry — it should take about 20 seconds. This step is key, both Larson and McGuckin say. ""The alcohol works and it does kill the virus and most bacteria, but the problem that we have … is that people don't use it appropriately for the given period of time,” McGuckin adds. 5. Cleaning products are not a substitute for hand sanitizer Courtesy World Health Organization Disinfectant sprays and antibacterial cleaning wipes should not be used as stand-ins for hand sanitizer. These products are meant for “hard, nonporous surfaces,” not human skin, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says. Even so, some people are using them this way. A report released by the CDC in early June found that approximately one-third of adult respondents in a recent survey engaged in “nonrecommended high-risk practices” with cleaning supplies in an effort to prevent a coronavirus infection. These practices included using bleach on food products, applying household cleaning and disinfectant products to skin, and inhaling or ingesting cleaners and disinfectants — all of which are unsafe. 6. Hand sanitizer can be dangerous Hand sanitizer can be toxic when ingested, especially by children. It can irritate the lining of the throat and cause gastrointestinal issues. And “drinking only a small amount” can cause alcohol poisoning in kids, according to the FDA. If you or your child ingests hand sanitizer, call poison control or a medical professional immediately. Hand sanitizer is also flammable. Though the CDC says the incidence of fires due to alcohol-based hand sanitizer is “very low,” it advises hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities to store hand sanitizer in a safe manner away from sources of ignition. The U.S. Postal Service also has restrictions on shipping alcohol-based hand sanitizer through the mail due to flammability concerns. 7. Homemade hand sanitizer can be ineffective There's no shortage of recipes for homemade hand sanitizer on the internet during this pandemic era. But the FDA, which regulates hand sanitizers, says it's best to leave the production of germ-killing gels to the professionals. ""If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer,” the agency says. Also: Adding rubbing alcohol to a bottle of non-alcohol hand sanitizer will not make the sanitizer more powerful. The FDA says it “is unlikely to result in an effective product.” Courtesy World Health Organization"

According to a new study, it can make you age faster too.﻿ The study, published recently in the journal Science Advances, shows that ongoing exposure to heat over 80 degrees accelerates biological aging, which is how your body ages on the inside at the cellular level, regardless of how many birthdays you’ve had. This might mean, for example, that instead of getting a specific health condition at a certain older age, it happens earlier, says Deborah Carr, director of the Center of Innovation in Social Science at Boston University, who studies heat and aging. “[It] means you [have] more years of suffering, more years of demands on your caregiver,” Carr explains. It also means you may not have Medicare in place to properly care for any premature health problems that arise, she notes. Heat’s impact on the aging process If you’re living in an area with extreme heat for half the year, you could be even more prone to faster aging, the study found. In fact, for people living in hot climates, biological aging sped up nearly three years in some cases. For the study, a team of researchers at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California used different biological clock models to measure markers of aging in blood samples from 3,686 American adults, ages 56 and older. The researchers then compared each individual’s aging outcomes, measured by slight changes in their DNA, with their geographical heat index, considering heat and humidity. Researchers categorized hot days as those that were 80 to 90 degrees, 90 to 103 degrees, and 103 to 124 degrees. They found that people who lived in areas that experienced more days of extreme heat were more likely to see greater increases in their biological age compared with people who experienced fewer hot days. “Participants living in areas where heat days, as defined as Extreme Caution or higher levels [90 degrees and up], occur half the year, such as Phoenix, Arizona, experienced up to 14 months of additional biological aging compared to those living in areas with fewer than 10 heat days per year,” study coauthor Eunyoung Choi said in a statement. “Even after controlling for several factors, we found this association. Just because you live in an area with more heat days, you’re aging faster biologically.” How heat affects your health Biological age varies for everyone because it’s based on how your cells age. Chronological age, meanwhile, refers to how long you’ve been alive. One of the ways s﻿﻿cientists measure biological age is based on methylation — a process that changes DNA. “When you have extreme heat or when you’re exposed to it, it causes stress to your body. That stress can manifest, particularly in your cells, by changes in your DNA,” explains Arnab Ghosh, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine who studies the effects of extreme heat on older adults. It’s not just heat that can affect a person’s biological age, Ghosh says. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking or having a condition like diabetes, can change it too. Some evidence suggests that accelerated biological aging could raise the risk of dementia; it has been linked with other health issues, too, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. Heat can also raise the risk of heart attack and stroke, according to research. Ghosh notes that heat can be harder on some older individuals, including people who take certain medications or have other chronic conditions. Women may also be more susceptible to complications from heat, according to a study published in 2024, which found that women ages 40 to 64 were as vulnerable to the effects of heat as men ages 65-plus. “Whether that [heat-related stress] leads [directly] to problems or aging or advanced aging is still an open question,” Ghosh says. And researchers aren’t sure if heat stress effects are permanent, he adds. Your personal heat baseline Being in 90-plus-degree weather isn’t a standard cutoff for when heat stress begins. Everyone has a different threshold, meaning you can still experience heat stress at 80 degrees, for example. People who live in warmer climates year-round may partly adapt to the heat naturally, but it can be harder during a heat wave. If you live in Arizona, for example, you may have a different baseline than someone who lives in Montana — a phenomenon known as acclimatization, Ghosh says. Everything from your behavior and age to chronic conditions and what you wear can influence your risk for heat stress, Ghosh says, and scientists don’t know the threshold for each person. A 2021 study showed that being in 75.2 degrees continuously without proper cooling can affect your body. “That can really have a significant wear and tear on the body, especially at night,” says Carr. A certain temperature can feel different in various places — it may be cooler near a beach but feel warmer in a city with little breeze, Carr says. Knowing your threshold can get complicated if you spend part of your year in a hotter area and the rest in a cooler climate, she adds. Plus, structures in areas that are warmer year-round likely have air conditioning, but that’s not the case in cooler areas, especially where older homes are common, Carr points out. 5 ways to ward off heat’s harmful health effects You can’t stop the temps from climbing, but there are a few ways to stay safe in the heat — and perhaps ease the heat stress that could make you age faster. 1. Stay alert. Watch the news or stay up to date on advisory warnings so you can adapt what you do, how you hydrate or what you wear, Ghosh says. “As temperatures warm up, people have to be more aware of the environment around them and adjust accordingly,” Ghosh adds. The first heat wave of the season can be the worst on health, he says. 2. Avoid extreme temps. The hottest time of the day is during midday hours— a good time to stay indoors in air conditioning, especially during a heat wave, Ghosh says. If you know you don’t do well in high heat, don’t run errands at the hottest times of the day. As you get older, you may not be able to do things at midday that you could do just a few years ago, Carr explains. “People really need to be mindful about altering their behaviors [when it’s hot],” Carr adds. 3. Watch your meds. Certain medications, such as those for high blood pressure or heart disease, may raise your risk for fainting in high heat. Know if any drugs or supplements you take could make you less tolerant to the heat, Ghosh says. Keep your medications out of the heat too, Carr adds, since exposure to varying temperatures can alter them chemically. 4. Keep cool at night. Sleep in a lower temperature to avoid heat stress — especially if you already have trouble sleeping, Carr says. 5. Plan for the heat. “Have a climate plan just the way you might have a will,” Carr advises. Know where you can go if you need to leave your home or what to do if you don’t have power due to high heat. “That can be really helpful, especially for older people,” Carr says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/how-to-reduce-microplastics/,"7 Ways to Trim Microplastics from Your Life It’s impossible to get rid of them all, but you can cut back substantially with the right changes By Katherine Hobson, AARP Comments En español Published April 17, 2025 Paul Spella The more researchers look for microplastics in the human body, the more they find them. The tiny fragments are released when larger plastic items break down in the environment and when they’re shed from plastic-containing packaging or materials during use. Increasingly, researchers are showing that microplastics can make their way into the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and elsewhere. What isn’t clear is whether they pose a health threat to people. Researchers reported recently that levels of plastic in the brain were higher in people who had dementia than in those who didn’t, but they don’t know whether the plastic contributes to dementia risk or if changes seen in dementia make the brain more susceptible to microplastic accumulation. In 2024, researchers found jagged microplastics and even tinier nanoplastics in the plaques in some people’s carotid arteries, and those people had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke or death, according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. In 2024, researchers published a review of evidence, mostly animal studies, that found exposure to microplastics is “suspected” to harm human digestive and respiratory health, including a potential link to colon and lung cancer. It’s “highly probable” that microplastics could harm human health, says Philip Kuriakose, M.D., a hematologist and medical oncologist at the Henry Ford Cancer Institute in Detroit. “But it hasn’t been fully proven yet.” The potential for health problems is particularly relevant for older adults, whose bodies are less able to repair the harm that plastics (and the chemicals they may contain) can do to the body, Kuriakose says. Exposure to microplastics could exacerbate existing health problems that are more common with age, such as heart disease and possibly vascular dementia, he says. Microplastics are everywhere – they’ve even been detected on Mount Everest – and it’s not practical to avoid them entirely. “We’re never going to be able to eliminate plastic exposures, and in some cases, we shouldn’t, because there’s a risk-benefit ratio for everything, and there are benefits of plastics,” says Douglas Walker, an associate professor in the Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health at Emory University, who studies microplastics. “But I do think we should have mindfulness about our plastic use.” Here are some relatively easy lifestyle changes that can help reduce your exposure, the researchers say: 1. Cut back on single-use plastics. Plastic pollution accumulates in the environment – including the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. You can do your part by following Walker’s top recommendation: Choose alternatives to the plastics you use once and then toss, such as plastic wrap, bags, cutlery and food and beverage containers, whenever possible. 2. Opt for water from the faucet rather than bottled. If you have access to clean tap water, it’s a better choice than buying bottled, says Britta Baechler, marine biologist and director of ocean plastics research at the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. One 2024 study found that an average liter of bottled water contained 240,000 tiny pieces of plastic, 90 percent of them the extremely tiny nanoplastics. While tap water also contains microplastics, bottled water has more, research has shown. That seems to be true even for water sold in glass bottles, suggesting microplastic particles are getting into the water through the packaging process, she says. “For me, that’s evidence to suggest that tap water is best for both you and the planet,” Baechler says. When you’re on the go, fill up a reusable stainless steel or glass bottle. Home-based water filtration is also an option. Look for a filter that has NSF/ANSI 401 certification, which means it can reduce the amount of microplastics in your water. AARP’s Brain Health Resource Center Find in-depth journalism, explainers on diseases of the brain — dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, mental-health topics — plus healthy habits to support memory and mental skills. Learn, take action, build healthy habits 3. Don’t mix plastic containers and heat. Walker says he stores and heats up leftovers in a glass container rather than a plastic one. And when he buys foods meant to be heated up in their single-use plastic packaging, he transfers them to a microwave-safe dish or bowl, and then heats them. Some foods shouldn’t even be stored in plastic. For example, it’s a good idea not to store oil-rich foods in plastic containers or to let them come into contact with plastic wrap because the oil can cause the plastic to leach into food, Walker says. 4. Extend that caution to hot beverages. When your barista hands you coffee in a disposable cup, it’s most likely lined with plastic, even if it’s primarily made of paper. When hot liquid hits that plastic, it releases microplastics into your drink, research has found. Bring your own reusable, non-plastic cup, instead. (Bonus: Some coffee shops will give you a small discount if you BYOC.) Are you a tea drinker? Recent studies have pointed out micro and nanoplastics found in teabags, which can leach particles into the tea. Those kinds of findings “made me change my tea-drinking habits,” Baechler says. “I now use looseleaf tea in a reusable stainless-steel steeper.” 5. Look for alternatives to plastic cutting boards and cooking utensils. Chopping food on plastic cutting boards is a potentially “substantial” source of microplastics in food, according to a study reported in 2023 from the University of North Dakota. Other options include boards made of glass, marble, bamboo or wood. (Just be sure you understand how to clean and care for them properly.) Plastic cooking utensils such as spatulas can also be swapped out for metal or silicone. Don’t feel you have to get rid of everything in your kitchen immediately. “I do a little bit at a time, and then eventually I’ve taken a lot of [plastic] things out of my life,” says Tracey Woodruff, M.D., a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive sciences at UC San Francisco and an author of the 2024 review of evidence on microplastics and health. 6. Focus on minimally processed foods. You may have heard a lot about plastics in the ocean – more than 8 million tons of plastic flow from rivers and beaches into the ocean every year, according to the UN Environment Program, and that plastic is gobbled up by the seafood we eat. But fish and shellfish aren’t the only protein source of microplastics. A study published in 2024 looked at 16 types of protein that people commonly eat, including fish and shellfish, pork, beef and chicken, and plant-based proteins such as tofu and meat replacements. “We found there’s no difference in concentration of microplastics,” says Baechler, an author on that study. She and colleagues found at least some microplastics in 88 percent of the samples. One way to trim back on the microplastics you eat: steer clear of processed foods, which had more microplastics than lightly processed foods, Baechler says. And when you shop, try to avoid plastic packaging when possible, Kuriakose says. 7. Vacuum and leave your shoes at the door. We inhale plastic particles indoors and out. In your home, a vacuum with a HEPA filter can get rid of some of the microplastics, which are present in dust, says Woodruff. Removing shoes at the door also cuts down on tracked-in dust from outdoors, she says. Synthetic fabrics can produce tiny plastic fibers, and dryers seem to disperse those into the air, one study found. To be on the safe side, when you pull the lint filter out of the dryer, clean it out directly over a trash bin and keep it as contained as possible, Baechler says. You can also buy fewer clothes made with synthetic fibers, to the degree that that’s practical. Bonus tip: Make yourself resilient in other ways. While you’re being mindful about your exposures, you can shore up your own defenses against all potential threats to your health, Woodruff says. That means adopting habits like a healthy diet, regular exercise, sufficient sleep and not smoking.

It Could Be Norovirus What to do if you catch the highly contagious virus — and tips for avoiding it during outbreaks RealPeopleGroup / Getty Images By Rachel Nania, Updated January 02, 2025 AARP En español Published March 23, 2023 / Updated January 02, 2025 You’re fine one minute, and the next, it hits you: stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. You’ve got a stomach bug. And while a few different germs could be to blame, chances are it’s the dreaded norovirus, the most common cause of these symptoms. Each year, norovirus sickens about 20 million Americans and causes around 900 deaths, mostly among adults 65 and older. If it seems like you’re seeing more of it now, you’re not wrong. Cases surged in November and December of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And while norovirus outbreaks are most common between the months of November and April, the number of outbreaks recorded during the first week of December, the latest data available, was well above previous years. Common Symptoms of Norovirus Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain The very nature of norovirus makes it hard to dodge. For starters, the intestine-inflaming virus spreads quickly and easily among people; you can also pick it up from contaminated foods and surfaces. Plus, it’s what University of Maryland infectious disease physician Wilbur Chen describes as a “hearty” virus. It can survive on surfaces for long periods — we’re talking hours, even days. And it only takes a few virus particles to make you sick. Meanwhile, infected individuals can shed billions. Preventing norovirus Still, experts say there are a few steps you can take to help prevent a bout with the bug. And the most important is the most basic. “When talking about norovirus, and really any other virus, the best way to prevent yourself from getting sick is not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth unless you’ve washed your hands first,” says Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic. There’s a cringe factor to how norovirus is transmitted: by tiny particles of feces (poop) or vomit from an infected person. If someone has norovirus and doesn’t wash their hands after using the restroom and then goes to touch a doorknob, others can pick it up if they touch the doorknob and then touch their mouth. The same goes if that infected person shakes another individual’s hand or handles food. (Food like fruits and vegetables can also get contaminated when washed or grown with contaminated water.) Common Settings of Norovirus Outbreaks Health care facilities, including nursing homes Restaurants/catered events Schools and child care centers Cruise ships Source: CDC And an important note on cleaning your hands: “Alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't work so well against norovirus, so washing your hands well with soap and water is critical and important,” says Sabrina Assoumou, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of medicine at Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine. Soap and water — a vigorous scrub for about 20 seconds — can break up the virus’ structure much better than alcohol-based gels and sprays. If someone in your house comes down with norovirus, limit the amount of sharing that happens with food and utensils, Assoumou advises. And clean surfaces frequently and thoroughly. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a list of cleaning products that are effective against norovirus. You can also use a solution of 5 to 25 tablespoons of household bleach per gallon of water (2 percent to 10 percent), the CDC says. Finally, because norovirus is the leading cause of illness from contaminated food in the U.S., it’s important to wash fruits and vegetables and to cook oysters and other shellfish thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Common Symptoms of Norovirus Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain Common Settings of Norovirus Outbreaks Health care facilities, including nursing homes Restaurants/catered events Schools and child care centers Cruise ships Source: CDC What to do if you get it Unfortunately, if you do come down with norovirus, there’s no medicine to treat it. “The big thing is hydration,” Binnicker says. “That’s what’s going to put most people in the hospital with norovirus, is getting dehydrated.” About 465,000 people head to the emergency room each year with norovirus, and more than 100,000 are hospitalized with it. Water, sports drinks and over-the-counter rehydration drinks can help to replace fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhea, the CDC says. Just steer clear of anything with alcohol or caffeine. And pay attention to your symptoms — this is especially important for older adults, who are more susceptible to dehydration. If you start to feel dizzy or lightheaded or notice you haven’t urinated in a while, that could be a sign of severe dehydration, which requires medical attention. Another reason to see a doctor is if your symptoms don’t let up after a few days. The good news is, most of the time norovirus leaves as quickly as it comes on; people start to feel better within one to three days. That said, you can still spread the virus to others even a few days after you’re feeling fine, Binnicker says. “So, it’s really important, even after you get better, after you’ve stopped having symptoms, to continue to really be diligent about washing hands, especially if you’re in a household with other people,” he adds. More reason the keep up the hand hygiene: Immunity to norovirus is short-lived. Plus, there are different types of noroviruses, and infection with one will not protect you from another.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/digestion-changes-with-age/,"New Tummy Troubles? How Aging Affects the Digestive System Learn how these changes can impact your health at 50-plus — and what you can do to get some relief By Stacey Freed, AARP Comments Published March 21, 2025 Shana Novak (Prop Stylist: Michelle Longo/Halley Resources) Your digestive system is hard at work 24/7. With breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks in between, breaking down food into nutrients for use as energy, growth and cell repair is an exhausting schedule. After decades of this routine, your digestive system would probably like to retire. While that’s not an option, it does slow down as you get older, which can give rise to new health challenges. Here’s a look at what happens to your digestive system as you age and how you can alleviate some common complications. Digestive changes — from gum to bum Digestion starts in your mouth, says Sarah Cook, a registered dietitian at UR Endocrinology at Highland Hospital in Rochester, New York. Many older adults have xerostomia, “a fancy way of saying lack of saliva or dry mouth,” Cook explains, making it difficult to taste and swallow food. This is often a side effect of medications like muscle relaxers and those taken for allergies, depression and Parkinson’s disease. Cook points out that our teeth age, too, and those changes can also interfere with chewing, swallowing and digesting. From your mouth, your chewed food — now a small ball called a bolus — enters your esophagus, which starts pushing it toward your stomach. However, aging muscles are not as strong as they once were, and a decrease in muscle contractions makes it harder for food to move through the digestive tract, slowing digestion and creating a feeling of fullness. “Often [older adults] don’t feel hunger, and they have a decreased appetite, which can lead to all kinds of problems,” such as not getting enough calories or making poor nutritional choices and “eating things that are more pleasurable versus more nutrient-dense,” says Sandra Darling, an osteopathic physician in the Department of Wellness and Preventive Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. Along the way, digestive enzymes in your mouth, pancreas, stomach and small intestines help break down your food. But as we age, there’s a decline in the production of these enzymes, making it more difficult to break down food into smaller particles that can be absorbed into the body. “That can lead to abdominal pain and food sensitivities that were never a problem before,” such as an intolerance to lactose or dairy products, Darling says. It also can increase sensitivity to acidic, spicy or greasy foods. “Foods that maybe you could eat when you were middle-aged, all of a sudden are very difficult [to consume],” Darling adds. “And it can cause a lot of pain; it can cause a lot of acid reflux.” Common digestive issues for older adults While gastrointestinal (GI) problems can plague anyone at any age, older adults tend to experience them more often, which doesn’t always bode well for overall health. “They say our health begins in our gut, and as soon as you have an unhealthy digestive system, that can lead to an unhealthy body and brain,” Darling says. According to the Cleveland Clinic, some common GI issues that may worsen with age include: Constipation. You feel full and have difficulty passing stool, which may be hard or dry. Not eating enough fiber and not drinking enough water can cause this uncomfortable condition, and so can some medications. About one-third of older adults have occasional symptoms of constipation, the National Institute on Aging says.Gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD or acid reflux. You may have a burning sensation in your throat or have trouble swallowing due to stomach acid flowing back up through the esophagus.Diverticulosis. According to the Cleveland Clinic, 50 percent of people over 60 have this ailment, in which small pouches develop on your intestines and push through weak spots in the outer wall. You may feel pain in your lower abdomen or have a fever if there’s an infection (known as diverticulitis). Research suggests that diverticulosis is caused by a diet low in plant fiber and high in processed starches. This may make it difficult to expel waste and put pressure on the colon.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an umbrella term that includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD is an autoimmune disorder in which a person’s immune system attacks the GI tract, leading to chronic inflammation. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and blood in the stool. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the condition appears to result from interactions between genetics and the environment. A study published in 2021 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that the prevalence of IBD in older adults has risen over the past two decades. IBD should not be confused with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), which can cause cramping, belly pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea and/or constipation. The exact causes of IBS aren’t known, but it can be triggered by stress, food allergies, and severe infection, among other things. Lifestyle changes can help relieve symptoms There are a few general steps you can take to alleviate digestive issues. For example, stress can exacerbate GI troubles, so “it’s critical to learn some breathing techniques, meditation, even walking in nature” to help manage stress, Darling says. In addition to reducing stress, you can do the following to help tackle digestive issues and keep your digestive system running smoothly: Limit triggers like caffeine, spicy foods and citrusEat smaller mealsEat earlier in the evening to give your body more time to digest before lying down to sleep. (As a side note, depending on what you’ve eaten, it takes two to five days for your food to go all the way through — and out — your digestive system.)Eat fiber-rich foods, like whole grains (barley, brown rice), whole-wheat pasta or bread, fruits, vegetables, beans, and nuts. These foods can help stool pass more easily through your digestive system. The National Academy of Medicine recommends 21 grams of fiber for women over 50 and 30 grams for men over 50.Participate in regular physical activity. “Just more movement in general,” Darling says.Drink lots of water. That said, all fluids count. The National Council on Aging suggests dividing your body weight by three and drinking that number of ounces in fluids. If you’re 150 pounds, that means 50 ounces of water daily. Hydration helps stave off constipation. There is a bit of a paradox when it comes to digestion, nutrition and aging. As we age, “our nutrient requirements for vitamins and minerals increase, but the recommended calorie intake decreases,” Cook says. Moderately active females should get 1,800 calories daily, and moderately active males should get 2,200 to 2,400 calories daily, according to the National Institutes of Health. “Try to make every meal or snack count,” Cook says. “Make it a nutrient-dense option and not waste your calories on things that aren’t giving you much other than pure calories.” Stacey Freed is a contributing writer who covers remodeling, construction, lifestyle issues, education and pets.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-medications/,"Is an ‘Ozempic Pill’ the Future of Weight Loss Medications? When it comes to treating obesity, researchers are working to expand the pool of options By Rachel Nania, Updated November 08, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published July 03, 2023 / Updated November 08, 2023 Florian Gaertner / Getty Images The type 2 diabetes medications Ozempic and Mounjaro and their close relatives prescribed for weight loss, Wegovy and the newly approved Zepbound, have taken the world by storm for their ability to help people shed excess pounds. But these injectable drugs might not be the last word on weight loss medications. Researchers are working to expand the pool of options in the same medication class — what’s known as GLP-1 agonists. Among them: a daily pill. Obesity medicine physician scientist Fatima Cody Stanford, M.D., says she’s “thrilled to see the level of investigation that’s being put forth” with regard to the latest research. “We've seen this broaden as more and more people are beginning to recognize obesity for the complex, chronic, multifactorial, relapsing disease that it is, and I’m really excited to see that,” says Stanford, who works at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. More than 40 percent of Americans have obesity ﻿—﻿ defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater based on height and weight ﻿— according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting them at increased risk for other chronic illnesses such as heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Research shows that losing 5 to 10 percent of your total body weight can help to improve these conditions. So far, the more popular GLP-1 medications on the market are helping people lose, on average, 12 to 18 percent of their total weight, and some new drugs under investigation are achieving results beyond that. ﻿(Some of the current medications are approved specifically for weight loss, while others are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes but are being prescribed off-label by doctors for weight loss.) Here’s what to keep an eye on in the weight loss treatment pipeline﻿. A weight loss pill A few medications in clinical trials made news at the 2023 American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions, one being a daily semaglutide pill from the same company that makes Ozempic and Wegovy. (Semaglutide, ﻿a GLP-1 agonist, is the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which are given as weekly injections.) Late-stage study results published June 25 in The Lancet found that participants who took a semaglutide pill lost, on average, 15 percent of their body weight over a 68-week period, compared to 2.4 percent in the placebo group. Thirty-four percent of study participants who took the pill lost 20 percent of their body weight. A lower-dose semaglutide pill is currently available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The higher-dose version under investigation is being studied for both type 2 diabetes and weight loss management. Other GLP-1 pills are also in the works. Eli Lilly’s orforglipron helped study participants who were overweight (defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9) or who had obesity cut up to 14.7 percent of their body weight, on average, after 36 weeks in a phase 2 trial. The results were published June 23 in the New England Journal of Medicine. And Pfizer’s danuglipron, yet another GLP-1 agonist being researched﻿, was found in a phase 2 clinical trial to help participants with type 2 diabetes lose weight and lower blood sugar levels in the first 16 weeks, according to research published in JAMA Network Open. Slightly different from the GLP-1 pills but equally as buzzworthy is an investigational medication called retatrutide. In another set of trial results, also reported at the 2023 American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions, researchers found that study participants with obesity lost more than 24 percent of their starting body weight (an average of 60 pounds) in a 48-week period when taking the highest dose of retatrutide. All of the participants taking the pill lost at least 5 percent of their total body weight in the trial. The phase 2 results were ﻿published June 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study’s authors note that participants taking the medication were continuing to lose weight at the end of the trial, and researchers “speculate that greater weight reductions may be observed in the longer-duration phase 3 trial.” While some people may prefer a weekly injection, Chetna Bakshi, M.D., a bariatric surgeon at Northwell Health’s Syosset Hospital in New York, says adding a pill to the mix could “offer more options for those patients who are unable to do the injections.” It could also be a good option for people who travel often, since the injectable medications have to be refrigerated. “A pill is very easy to take with you, so it definitely allows for more options for patients,” Bakshi says. More medications could improve access Adding new options to the arsenal could help improve access for patients. Both Ozempic and Wegovy are on the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list, and Stanford says she has “struggled to get these medications on a consistent basis” for her patients who have the insurance or the means to pay for them. (A one-month supply costs around $1,000 or more.) What’s more, there are currently just three GLP-1 drugs approved for the treatment of overweight and obesity — Wegovy, Zepbound (approved by the FDA on Nov. 8 and whose active ingredient is tirzepatide) and an older medication called Saxenda, whose active ingredient is liraglutide — leaving health care providers with “fairly limited options for someone who does not have diabetes,” Bakshi says. While we wait for more research and potentially more drug approvals to trickle in, both Stanford and Bakshi say it’s important to talk to your health care provider about your weight loss goals and options if you’re struggling to lose weight. These treatments are not for everyone, Bakshi stresses, and like all medications they can cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain and constipation. Patients with certain conditions, such as a history of medullary thyroid cancer, should not take them, Bakshi adds. “There’s no miracle drug; everything comes with risks, everything comes with complications,” she says. It’s also important to consider costs. Many insurance companies will cover drugs that have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients who have diabetes. Coverage for approved weight loss medications, however, is trickier. ﻿Many insurance plans, including Medicare, won’t cover them﻿. ​​ ​Editor's note: The story, first published July 3, 2023, has been updated to reflect the new federal approval of Zepbound for weight loss.

How to keep the usually harmless critters at bay with good hygiene By Barbara Stepko, AARP Comments En español Published November 18, 2020 Getty Images Demodex mites live in your eyelashes. Getty Images Hygiene tip Until you're rid of mites, ditch your eye makeup, change your towels regularly, and keep bedding and pillowcases clean by washing them in hot water and drying them in a heated dryer. Also give family members and pets the once-over to check for symptoms of an infestation. How's this for unsettling? Right now, as you are reading these words, microscopic parasites (known as Demodex mites) are living in your eyelashes. What the heck are they doing there? Well, these critters crave oil, which makes the edges of your eyelids prime real estate, since each edge is lined with 25 or so sebum-producing glands. These mites aren't crazy about light, so during the day they burrow deep in the eyelash follicles and snooze. They come out at night, while we're sleeping, and have a party — mating and munching on dead skin cells. “That's why we tend to have more crusting around our eyes when we wake up,” says Julie Lam, an optometrist in Cave Creek, Arizona. When fun time is over, they crawl back into our hair follicles to lay their eggs. Before you make a beeline for your bathroom mirror, magnifying glass in hand, there are a few things you should know. First of all, you can't see these mites. Also, and this is somewhat reassuring, we all have small numbers of them; they're part of our bodies’ normal microbiome. ""In small numbers, Demodex mites typically aren't a problem,” reassures Scheffer Tseng, M.D., a Miami-based ophthalmologist. “However, if they reproduce in large numbers, you reach a threshold.” That's when things can turn kind of, well, icky. Eye and skin problems associated with mites Blepharitis. “Blepharitis is the number one common disease associated with mites,” Tseng says. This inflammation of the eyelids, which typically occurs as a result of a blockage in the oil glands at the base of the lashes, can be caused by an infestation. What's more, Demodex mites carry bacteria and release it into the skin, triggering irritation and inflammation on the lids that can lead to the signature symptoms: crusty lashes, itchiness in the surrounding skin, fluctuating blurry vision, and red, swollen, watery eyes. (Making matters worse, the mites feed on the ensuing crusting, exacerbating the condition.) And the eggs that they lay at along the base of the lashes can lead to trichiasis (misdirected lashes) or lash loss. Rosacea. Demodex mites also frequently occur in greater numbers in those with rosacea, leading to flare-ups. In fact, people with the skin condition have about 18 times more mites. “We're still trying to figure out the connection — whether Demodex mites are the cause or result of rosacea,” Lam says. However, according to the National Rosacea Society, “Evidence appears to be mounting that an overabundance of Demodex may possibly trigger an immune response in people with rosacea, or that the inflammation may be caused by certain bacteria associated with the mites."" How to handle a possible mite overload Demodex mites live in your eyelashes. Getty Images Hygiene tip Until you're rid of mites, ditch your eye makeup, change your towels regularly, and keep bedding and pillowcases clean by washing them in hot water and drying them in a heated dryer. Also give family members and pets the once-over to check for symptoms of an infestation. See your doctor if you experience possible symptoms of an outbreak. They can carefully remove individual lashes and look at them under a microscope to see if there are mites stuck to the hair follicles. The most effective way to eliminate a mild infestation is daily eye hygiene. Clean the eye area twice a day, with warm water and a gentle cleanser. Less-than-clean skin supplies mites with extra lipid nourishment, encouraging them to stick around and reproduce. “You don't necessarily have to kill the mites, you just need to prevent the mites from mating,” Tseng says. “They will eventually die off.” Even better, pick up a package of eyelid wipes. The back-and-forth cleansing motion tends to be more efficient in clearing away makeup, oil and other buildup on eyelids, says Lam, who prescribes Ocusoft lid scrubs to patients. Wrap one around your finger and lightly scrub along the base of the top and bottom lashes, then rinse off. If you have a bout of blepharitis, apply a warm, moist washcloth over clean eyes for a few minutes every day. The warm moisture will make it easier to wipe away crusty buildup and keep lids and lashes clean. It will also help reduce gland secretions, which bring on the bacteria that cause irritation. And the fewer secretions, the fewer mites you'll have since they'll have less to feed on. Demodex mites live in your eyelashes. Getty Images Hygiene tip Until you're rid of mites, ditch your eye makeup, change your towels regularly, and keep bedding and pillowcases clean by washing them in hot water and drying them in a heated dryer. Also give family members and pets the once-over to check for symptoms of an infestation. More serious outbreaks ""Blepharitis is usually bacteria-based, so when you clean around the eyes, it usually gets better,” says Lam. But if cleaning around the eyes doesn't reduce symptoms, Lam says, “you have to be a bit more aggressive.” Tea tree oil, swiped along the lash line, is a kind of kryptonite to mites. “In its pure form or in high concentrations, tea tree oil contains chemical components which can be extremely irritating,” says Tseng, who suggests using a kinder, over-the-counter formulation infused with diluted tea tree oil. One such product, Cliradex, contains a potent component in tea tree oil — terpinen-4-ol. It works by killing mites directly and disrupting the life cycle to prevent reinfestation, as well as easing symptoms such as itchiness. ""The total life cycle of mites is several weeks,” says Lam. “But I usually have patients on tea tree wipes for at least 30 to 60 days, depending on the severity of the condition.” In-office procedures, such as eyelid microexfoliation, may also be recommended to offer relief to those with blepharitis-related issues. BlephEx, for example, employs a device with a rotating sponge tip to dislodge debris, crusting and remains of bacteria along the lash line. For a severe infestation, your eye doctor may prescribe a medicated ointment, which is rubbed along the lash line. Not only will it fight bacteria and ease inflammation, it will help prevent mites from moving around — and multiplying. Additional antibiotics and/or steroids may be needed to treat underlying skin conditions. Barbara Stepko was a longtime health and lifestyle writer, and former editor at Women’s Health and InStyle.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/is-it-too-late-to-get-flu-shot/,"Everyone is Sick: Is it Too Late for a Flu Shot? Plus, the importance of testing and treating during this historically bad flu season By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published February 24, 2025 AARP (Getty Images 3) If it seems like everyone around you is getting sick this winter, you’re not wrong. The U.S. is having one of the worst flu seasons in years, with most states reporting high or very high levels of flu activity. Tens of thousands of patients are filing into hospitals each week, the latest federal data shows, and so far, 16,000 people in the U.S. have died from the flu this season. At the same time, other bugs, such as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), COVID-19 and norovirus, are also swirling about and sickening the masses. Steven Furr, M.D., a family physician in Jackson, Alabama, and board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, says a few factors are feeding the worrying influenza trends this year. “One, this is just a tough flu strain that’s going around right now,” Furr says. “Typically, there are two flu strains we deal with, influenza A and influenza B. Influenza B tends to be a milder strain, whereas influenza A tends to be much more severe. And essentially, every case we’re seeing this year is influenza A.” Another contributor: Flu vaccination rates are low this year compared to previous years. As of Feb. 8, less than half of the U.S. adult population (45 percent) has received a flu shot this season, and roughly the same share of children (45.9 percent) have been vaccinated for influenza, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. “So that really hurts when the number of people who are immunized is much less,” Furr says. Making matters worse, Furr says, is that doctors are seeing more cases of pneumonia following the flu. (Influenza can cause damage to the lining of the lungs, Furr explains, leaving you more susceptible to other infections that can morph into pneumonia.) In some instances, the subsequent pneumonias are resistant to antibiotics, making them especially difficult to treat. Preventing the flu: It’s not too late If you skipped your flu shot this fall, doctors say it’s not too late to get one now. “Usually, you’ll get some protection within a week to 10 days, and we’re not through the flu season yet,” Furr says. While flu activity tends to peak in February, cases can continue through March and April. “In fact, we’ve seen some years where it actually goes to the summer months,” Furr says. Another reason to get the vaccine if you haven’t already: While influenza A is pummeling the country now, sometimes influenza B “starts showing up later in the season,” Furr says. And it’s possible — albeit unlucky — to get infected with both strains during the same flu season. “So really, if you haven’t been vaccinated, you ought to do so,” Furr adds. Adults 50 and older are also eligible for a pneumococcal vaccine, which can help prevent a common type of pneumonia. This vaccine can be administered at any time during the calendar year. Feeling sick? It’s important to test and treat If you start experiencing symptoms of the flu — fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue and more — it’s important to get tested to confirm that what ails you is, indeed, influenza. Symptoms of other respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19 and RSV, can sometimes mimic the flu. Furr says a sure sign of flu is the rapid onset of symptoms. “Most people who get the flu will tell you, ‘I was fine at 11:51 a.m., but I felt really bad at 11:52 a.m.’ I mean, you can just almost point to the time that you suddenly get those severe body aches, then you start getting the fever,” he says. You can get a flu test at your doctor’s office or use a combination COVID-19/flu test, sold over the counter at most drugstores. If you’re positive for flu A or B, your doctor can prescribe antiviral medication that can help keep your symptoms from becoming severe — and the medicine works best when started immediately. (There are also antiviral treatments for COVID-19 if it turns out your infection is caused by the coronavirus.) “Antivirals interfere with the virus and decrease the level of the virus in a person’s body, and thereby decrease complications, decrease symptoms, get you better faster, and in some cases, [they] even prevent death,” Amesh Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, explained in a recent media briefing with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID). Antiviral treatment is especially important for older adults, who are more likely to get seriously ill from an influenza infection, says William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Between 50 and 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur in adults 65 and older, CDC data shows, and 70 to 85 percent of flu-related deaths happen in this age group. “As we get older and physically age, our immune systems also aren’t quite as robust as they were when we were younger, and so our immune systems are less able to fight off these infections,” Schaffner said during the NFID briefing. “As a consequence, older people are more likely to be hospitalized, admitted to the intensive care unit, and, frankly, die of these infections. We would like to do as much as we can to prevent that progression of illness.” Taking an antiviral early on in the course of an influenza infection may also reduce your risk of developing a secondary infection, like pneumonia. That’s because antivirals help keep your immune system in fighting shape so it’s better able to mount a defense against other infections that are trying to take hold, Adalja explains. “When you have influenza, it’s kind of a battle between the virus and your immune system. And a lot of the defense systems go into overdrive fighting influenza, and that puts you at risk for developing bacterial pneumonia because you are paralyzed fighting influenza,” Adalja says. “Year in and year out, the data would indicate that taking an antiviral as early as possible does reduce the severity of illness and keep you out of the hospital and the intensive care unit,” Schaffner says. “And often when it comes to influenza, the secondary bacterial infections that cause the more severe cases of pneumonia, that’s what puts you into the intensive care unit.” A few other tips to help stay healthy this flu season: Avoid people who are sick, cover your coughs and sneezes, and wash your hands and frequently touched surfaces often, the CDC says.

So if you’re on the thin side, should you consider plumping up? Not necessarily. If you come from a naturally thin family or have consistently had a low body mass index (BMI), a lighter-than-average weight may not be a problem. “Sometimes people have a low BMI but they’re perfectly healthy,” says Allison Miner, a professor of nutrition and dietetics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. (A BMI less than 18.5 is considered underweight.) Some research has found that having a bit of extra weight as you age may even be good for you. Some studies have found people with higher BMIs after 60 may have a lower dementia risk than those who were underweight or have a normal weight — though it might be because people lose weight as dementia begins to take hold. Having a healthy weight seems to be important for bone strength as well. Being underweight is a risk factor for osteoporosis and increases risk of fractures. (Obesity has been associated with risk for fractures in some cases, so striving for a healthy weight is best.) Calculate Your BMI Try AARP’s Body Mass Index Calculator and determine your healthy weight. Unintentionally shedding pounds due to things like illness, depression or a medication that steals your appetite can spell danger in your older years. “Unhealthy weight loss can lead to a state called sarcopenia, which is when you’ve lost so much muscle mass that you don’t have enough for healthy function,” says Naomi Parrella, M.D., chief of lifestyle medicine at Rush University System for Health in Chicago. Trying to gain weight for health reasons sound like an enviable challenge for much of the country but, experts say, putting on pounds can be just as difficult as taking them off. The challenge is making sure that the weight you’re putting on is made up of more muscle than fat. The good news: “The human body is designed to heal and thrive no matter how old you are,” Parrella says. When it comes to losing weight, men typically have it easier since they have more lean muscle mass than women. Plus they tend to drop weight faster because they have more pounds to lose compared to women. Meanwhile, women have an easier time gaining weight. As people age, maintaining a healthy weight can become a challenge—but not always in the way you might expect. While it’s often easier for women to gain weight, men generally have an advantage when it comes to losing it due to their higher lean muscle mass. They also tend to drop pounds more quickly because they typically start with more weight to lose. However, for both men and women, the real concern with aging isn’t just weight management—it’s the gradual loss of muscle mass that naturally occurs over time. Quick tips for gaining healthy weight Small changes to your meals and snacks can make a big difference, reccommends Rachel Gargano, chief registered dietitian at Live it Up and a board-certified nutritionist in sports dietetics and breastfeeding. Gaining weight in a healthy way means focusing on nutrient-dense foods that provide extra calories without making you feel overly full. Here is her expert advice: Drizzle extra oil or butter on your meals—since they're packed with calories but don’t take up much space, it’s an easy way to get more in without feeling too full.Make a PB&J on whole wheat bread, cut it into four pieces, and snack on one throughout the day. Small bites add up!Blend up a smoothie for a snack. Use whole milk, nut butter, banana, and frozen fruit or baby spinach for extra nutrients and fiber. Want even more calories? Toss in a little olive.Sprinkle seeds, nuts, or avocado on meals and snacks to sneak in extra calories without much effort.Don’t skip snacks! Go for high-calorie options like nut or seed butters, whole nuts, avocado, milk or reduced-fat Greek yogurt—make sure to avoid saturated fats which can raise cholestoral. Here’s 10 more strategies to help you put on healthy weight: 1. Talk to your doctor Before focusing on gaining weight, it’s worth asking—why was it lost in the first place? Could it be from medication side effects, dental issues like poorly fitting dentures, a recent illness or hospital stay, or even changes in mood like depression? Calculate Your BMI Try AARP’s Body Mass Index Calculator and determine your healthy weight. If you’re recovering from an illness like cancer, ask your doctor if there are any limitations or considerations you should be aware of as you regain the weight. Likewise, if you’re too blue to feel like eating, seek mental health treatment. pamela_d_mcadams / Getty Images Snack break No-Bake Peanut Butter Balls 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter, store-bought or homemade 1½ cups oats, old fashioned 1/2 cup finely chopped or powdered nuts (any type) 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/3 cup dried cranberries or raisins 1 TB vanilla extract 1 tsp flax or chia seeds Combine the ingredients, adjusting the amount of peanut butter to ensure a firm texture that is not too sticky. Smooth peanut butter provides more calories than chunky peanut butter because the body is more efficient in digesting smooth peanut butter. Roll into tablespoon-size balls and place on parchment paper. Cover and refrigerate. —Alison Miner 2. Focus on gaining muscle mass When you are increasing the number on the scale, good nutrition and strength training should go hand in hand, says David Creel, director of exercise physiology at the Bariatric & Metabolic Institute at Cleveland Clinic. Strong muscles are key to doing the things you want to as you age and avoiding frailty. “When we’re talking about loss of muscle, we’re concerned about function, like being able to carry your groceries,” Creel says. That’s where strength training comes in. You don’t have to work out at the gym or with a trainer, though if you’re new to this type of exercise, a few sessions can be beneficial to learn the proper form. You can get a decent workout at home using small weights or resistance bands, or just lift household objects (soup cans, milk jugs). Do push-ups against a wall using gravity and your body as the weight, squats while holding onto a counter, and crunches for your core. Aim to work out two days per week, but not on consecutive days, Creel advises. To get started, check out workout videos for simple strength training exercises on our﻿ Staying Fit page. ﻿ 3. Eat more often For most healthy adults, three balanced meals a day about five hours apart is the ideal meal schedule, Miner says. If you want to gain weight naturally, though, you need to increase meal frequency. Instead of your typical three meals, add a hearty snack three hours after breakfast and lunch and another one before bed. 4. Increase protein intake To gain muscle mass instead of fat, you need high protein foods—and plenty of it. “As we get older, our body needs to take in a little bit more protein to stimulate muscle growth and for muscle maintenance,” Parrella says. It’s also necessary for strength training, Creel says. “You want to make sure that you’ve got the resources to put on the weight as muscle,” he says. The general recommendation is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (about 3.6 grams per 10 pounds). But “we’re finding that it’s better to get more like 1.2 or 1.3 grams per kilogram in someone who is trying to gain weight,” Creel says. People absorb protein less effectively as they age, so it’s important to spread your intake throughout the day. A good rule of thumb is to consume 25 to 50 grams of protein, three or four times a day, or every time you eat. “Otherwise, you can’t absorb enough protein at a time to maintain your muscle mass,” Parrella says. In addition to animal protein like chicken, beef and fish, consider soy products like tofu and edamame. You can also get quality protein from dairy products and nuts and by combining legumes with grains — amaranth and quinoa are particularly high in protein. And mix whey protein powder with smoothies, or drink packaged whey protein shakes. pamela_d_mcadams / Getty Images Snack break No-Bake Peanut Butter Balls 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter, store-bought or homemade 1½ cups oats, old fashioned 1/2 cup finely chopped or powdered nuts (any type) 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/3 cup dried cranberries or raisins 1 TB vanilla extract 1 tsp flax or chia seeds Combine the ingredients, adjusting the amount of peanut butter to ensure a firm texture that is not too sticky. Smooth peanut butter provides more calories than chunky peanut butter because the body is more efficient in digesting smooth peanut butter. Roll into tablespoon-size balls and place on parchment paper. Cover and refrigerate. —Alison Miner 5. Have a large breakfast People tend to be hungry when they wake up in the morning, so use this to your advantage and eat a full breakfast. “That’s when you really want to deliver the calories,” says Miner. “Eating more calories when you’re hungry is really the key.” Appetite wanes in the evening, so you can eat less then. 6. Eat more calories and fat Even if they know they should gain weight, many people are afraid to add fat to their diets, says Bonnie Taub-Dix, dietitian and author of Read It Before You Eat It: Taking You From Label to Table. “Fats like almonds, avocado, nut butters, and olive and avocado oils are great ways to get healthy fat in your diet, get concentrated calories, but not have a negative impact on your health.” Miner suggests cooking rice and oatmeal with milk, even evaporated milk, to add calories. And use coconut milk as a base in stews and curries. Feel free to enjoy whole-fat yogurt. “The latest evidence on the full-fat yogurt and even cheese, believe it or not, is that they do not increase blood cholesterol levels,” Miner says. 7. Eat energy-dense meals “A meal with a salad, a main dish and different sides is a lot of food to eat for someone who may not be used to eating that much,” Taub-Dix says. “And a big salad before a meal could be too filling. You want to make the meal more concentrated. The goal is less volume of food.” One-dish meals that combine vegetables, legumes, and chicken or fish (think: stews and soups) are a good option, Taub-Dix says. If you really want a salad, make it count: Include beans, nuts, avocados and dressing made with healthy oils like olive oil — nothing fat-free. Anna_Shepulova / Getty Images Smoothie Time High-Calorie/High-Protein Smoothie 1 cup of whole cow’s milk or whole milk yogurt (substitute coconut milk, if vegan). But make sure not do go over the reccommended daily limit of saturated fat, about 13 grams a day is the maximum you want to consume, according to the American Heart Association. 1/3 cup of finely chopped walnuts 1 banana or 1 cup of blueberries or strawberries (fresh or frozen) 1 cup chopped fresh baby spinach or ½ cup shredded carrots 1/3 cup of orange or apple juice 1 TB chia or flax seeds 2 TB whey protein powder (substitute pea protein powder, if vegan) Put ingredients in a blender, adjusting the amount of each ingredient to suit your taste. Blend on high for 1½ minutes. Drink between meals or as a meal substitute. —Alison Miner 8. Take your time Just as people should lose weight gradually, making behavioral changes that will stick, you should take a measured approach to healthy weight gain. “Adding 300 to 500 calories a day is a good place to start,” Creel says. That should allow you to gain about a half pound to ﻿a pound a week. ﻿ 9. Drink your calories Downing a lot of high-calorie beverages is one of the ways that people gain weight, so it’s the natural strategy for adding heft to your frame, Creel says. Instead of plain water, drink milk or 100 percent juice, he says. Smoothies are the perfect choice. “The reason we use them for weight gain is because the body doesn’t have to do anything to break it down,” Miner says. “So all the calories that you’re taking in will be absorbed.” You can even add whole or ground nuts to the mix. “The body is not efficient in breaking nuts down,” Miner says. “If I were to give someone a half cup of nuts to eat, they might only absorb a half to three-quarters of the calories as if they were blended into a drink.” Start with an instant breakfast drink or protein powder and add nuts and whole milk or almond milk. Then experiment with Greek yogurt, 100 percent juices, fruit and nut butters. 10. Stimulate your appetite “It’s really hard to force yourself to eat when you’re not hungry,” says Miner. And older people tend to have a lower appetite to start with. Solution? If a prescribed medication is wrecking your appetite, ask your doctor if there’s a substitute and troubleshoot other medical issues that might be robbing your appetite. You can also ask a doctor about medications that increase hunger, such as megestrol acetate, oxandrolone or dronabinol. Food should also seem more appealing after exercise, Creel says. In addition to resistance training, try some light cardio in the pool, he advises. “There’s evidence that swimming, especially in cold water, may stimulate appetite more than exercise on dry land, as your body has to generate more heat,” he says. “It’s also a great activity for older adults who might have some limitations as well.” Anna_Shepulova / Getty Images Smoothie Time High-Calorie/High-Protein Smoothie 1 cup of whole cow’s milk or whole milk yogurt (substitute coconut milk, if vegan).

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/norovirus-stomach-bug-symptoms-prevention/#comments_widget_id,"Stomach Bug? It Could Be Norovirus What to do if you catch the highly contagious virus — and tips for avoiding it during outbreaks RealPeopleGroup / Getty Images By Rachel Nania, Updated January 02, 2025 AARP En español Published March 23, 2023 / Updated January 02, 2025 You’re fine one minute, and the next, it hits you: stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. You’ve got a stomach bug. And while a few different germs could be to blame, chances are it’s the dreaded norovirus, the most common cause of these symptoms. Each year, norovirus sickens about 20 million Americans and causes around 900 deaths, mostly among adults 65 and older. If it seems like you’re seeing more of it now, you’re not wrong. Cases surged in November and December of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And while norovirus outbreaks are most common between the months of November and April, the number of outbreaks recorded during the first week of December, the latest data available, was well above previous years. Common Symptoms of Norovirus Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain The very nature of norovirus makes it hard to dodge. For starters, the intestine-inflaming virus spreads quickly and easily among people; you can also pick it up from contaminated foods and surfaces. Plus, it’s what University of Maryland infectious disease physician Wilbur Chen describes as a “hearty” virus. It can survive on surfaces for long periods — we’re talking hours, even days. And it only takes a few virus particles to make you sick. Meanwhile, infected individuals can shed billions. Preventing norovirus Still, experts say there are a few steps you can take to help prevent a bout with the bug. And the most important is the most basic. “When talking about norovirus, and really any other virus, the best way to prevent yourself from getting sick is not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth unless you’ve washed your hands first,” says Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic. There’s a cringe factor to how norovirus is transmitted: by tiny particles of feces (poop) or vomit from an infected person. If someone has norovirus and doesn’t wash their hands after using the restroom and then goes to touch a doorknob, others can pick it up if they touch the doorknob and then touch their mouth. The same goes if that infected person shakes another individual’s hand or handles food. (Food like fruits and vegetables can also get contaminated when washed or grown with contaminated water.) Common Settings of Norovirus Outbreaks Health care facilities, including nursing homes Restaurants/catered events Schools and child care centers Cruise ships Source: CDC And an important note on cleaning your hands: “Alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't work so well against norovirus, so washing your hands well with soap and water is critical and important,” says Sabrina Assoumou, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of medicine at Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine. Soap and water — a vigorous scrub for about 20 seconds — can break up the virus’ structure much better than alcohol-based gels and sprays. If someone in your house comes down with norovirus, limit the amount of sharing that happens with food and utensils, Assoumou advises. And clean surfaces frequently and thoroughly. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a list of cleaning products that are effective against norovirus. You can also use a solution of 5 to 25 tablespoons of household bleach per gallon of water (2 percent to 10 percent), the CDC says. Finally, because norovirus is the leading cause of illness from contaminated food in the U.S., it’s important to wash fruits and vegetables and to cook oysters and other shellfish thoroughly to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Common Symptoms of Norovirus Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Stomach pain Common Settings of Norovirus Outbreaks Health care facilities, including nursing homes Restaurants/catered events Schools and child care centers Cruise ships Source: CDC What to do if you get it Unfortunately, if you do come down with norovirus, there’s no medicine to treat it. “The big thing is hydration,” Binnicker says. “That’s what’s going to put most people in the hospital with norovirus, is getting dehydrated.” About 465,000 people head to the emergency room each year with norovirus, and more than 100,000 are hospitalized with it. Water, sports drinks and over-the-counter rehydration drinks can help to replace fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhea, the CDC says. Just steer clear of anything with alcohol or caffeine. And pay attention to your symptoms — this is especially important for older adults, who are more susceptible to dehydration. If you start to feel dizzy or lightheaded or notice you haven’t urinated in a while, that could be a sign of severe dehydration, which requires medical attention. Another reason to see a doctor is if your symptoms don’t let up after a few days. The good news is, most of the time norovirus leaves as quickly as it comes on; people start to feel better within one to three days. That said, you can still spread the virus to others even a few days after you’re feeling fine, Binnicker says. “So, it’s really important, even after you get better, after you’ve stopped having symptoms, to continue to really be diligent about washing hands, especially if you’re in a household with other people,” he adds. More reason the keep up the hand hygiene: Immunity to norovirus is short-lived. Plus, there are different types of noroviruses, and infection with one will not protect you from another.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/high-blood-pressure-symptoms-and-causes/,"High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): A Guide to Symptoms, Causes and Tests Explore risk factors for high blood pressure, testing options and why it is known as the silent killer By Kimberly Hayes, AARP Reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments En español Published June 03, 2024 Getty Images High Blood Pressure Guide Symptoms, causes and tests Stages and types Treatment and prevention High blood pressure myths Alcohol and blood pressure Hypertension headache myths Smoking and high blood pressure Anxiety, stress and hypertension Is hypertension genetic? Medications that raise blood pressure Home blood pressure monitoring Surprising causes of hypertension A staggering three-quarters of Americans over age 60 have high blood pressure, otherwise known as hypertension, putting them at increased risk for stroke, heart attack and heart failure. Men tend to have higher blood pressure rates in their younger years, but women catch up around the time of menopause. Hypertension increases with age: ﻿Only 22.4 percent of people ages 18–39﻿ have the condition. But those numbers rise to 54.5 percent for people age 40–59 and 74.5 percent for people 60 and over. These alarming rates are even higher for people of color, especially for African Americans. Hypertension prevalence across all ages is higher among non-Hispanic Black adults (57.1 percent) than non-Hispanic white (43.6 percent) or Hispanic (43.7 percent) adults. ﻿ What causes high blood pressure? “The main cause of high blood pressure is aging blood vessels,” said Jordana Cohen, MD, MSCE, Associate Professor of Medicine, Renal-Electrolyte and Hypertension at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. She is also chair of the Hypertension Science Committee for the American Heart Association. Blood vessels tend to stiffen with age and becomes less flexible, which can drive up the pressure inside them. However, studies have found that there are populations of older people who don’t have high blood pressure, for example the remote South American Yanoma﻿mi tribe, whose members live in near-total isolation in the rainforests in southern Venezuela and northern Brazil. They eat very little salt and fat and have a diet high in plantains, fruit and meat, and their blood pressures stay the same as when they were younger. Research suggests that this could be related to their lower consumption of salt, and the fact that they eat a lot of potassium, Cohen said. They also have less exposure to modern-day risk factors such as pollution, stress and other diseases that are prevalent in our society, such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease, which all contribut﻿e to high blood pressure, Cohen added. Understanding a blood pressure reading Blood pressure is measured in stages, with a normal range being less than 120/80. The top number — the systolic— measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The bottom number — the diastolic — measures the pressure in your arteries when the blood is flowing back to the heart through the veins. Your blood pressure numbers are measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Stages at or above 120/80 include: elevated, stage 1 hypertension and stage 2 hypertension. A severely elevated blood pressure of 180/120 or greater can be a hypertensive crisis and could require guidance from your doctor, or in some cases, emergency care. VIDEO: How to Read Your Own Blood Pressure “The top number is what’s mostly considered our biggest indicator of risk,” Cohen said. It also tends to be the most responsive to treatment. The bottom number tends to be higher in younger people and then gets lower with age. Older patients can see a very wide split between their top and the bottom number, which can be concerning, Cohen said, especially if the bottom number gets too low as it can increase the risk of falls and kidney problems. “This is something that I see in my much older patients in their 80s, 90s and 100s.” ​ What are symptoms of high blood pressure? Most people with hypertension﻿ shouldn’t expect to experience symptoms from high blood pressure. “If your expectation is that you’re going to feel it, then you’re going to be somebody who’s missing it 90 percent of the time,﻿” Cohen said. Generally, people will not feel any symptoms of high blood pressure unless they are having the severely elevated blood pressure, which occurs when a patient’s underlying high blood pressure has accelerated to 180/120 or above and is damaging their vital organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys or eyes. In this scenario the person could face additional symptoms including sudden headache, blurred vision or vomiting, and should seek emergency medical assistance. It’s important to note that people with poorly controlled blood pressure could have readings in this higher range, but as long as they are not having other symptoms it may not be an emergency. However, they still should follow up with their doctor within a couple of days. Measuring your blood pressure While patients may assume a blood pressure measurement at ﻿a doctor’s office is the most accurate, that’s not always the case. To get a good blood pressure reading, it’s recommended the person sit in a qui﻿et environment with their feet flat on the floor and their arms on a table or desk in front of them, which may not always be how you are positioned at the doctor’s office. Couple that with the stress of a doctor’s visit﻿, and it’s easy to see how readings may not be 100 percent accurate. White coat hypertension and masked hypertension According to the Cleveland Clinic, between 15 to ﻿30 percent of people have so-called white coat hypertension, which means their blood pressure is higher at ﻿a health care provider’s office, but normal at home. ﻿﻿Estimates vary, however, with some research saying up to 50 percent or more people have white coat hypertension. High Blood Pressure Guide Symptoms, causes and tests Stages and types Treatment and prevention High blood pressure myths Alcohol and blood pressure Hypertension headache myths Smoking and high blood pressure Anxiety, stress and hypertension Is hypertension genetic? Medications that raise blood pressure Home blood pressure monitoring Surprising causes of hypertension VIDEO: How to Read Your Own Blood Pressure But it’s important not to discount these higher doctor’s office readings totally. “I think white coat can be used to deny high blood pressure,” said Beverly Green, M.D., senior investigator for Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. “There’s literature showing that people with white coat hypertension are higher risk of eventually getting high blood pressure.” At the opposite end of white coat hypertension is masked hypertension. Approximately 10 to 40 percent of people have this condition, which occurs when blood pressure is normal in the doctor’s office but high in everyday life. This can happen among people who typically smoke but avoid doing so right before a doctor’s visit. People who have sleep apnea could also be at risk, Cohen said. The importance of home blood pressure monitoring With home monitoring, patients can hopefully control their environment and take their readings at ideal times. (Look for guidelines on checking your blood pressure at home at the end of this article.) It’s important to make sure you are using an accurate device, and more than two-thirds of devices on the market right now are not, Cohen said. The website validatebp.org from the American Medical Association provides a list of devices that have been validated for accuracy and includes price ranges. It is of course important to still get your blood pressure checked at your doctor’s office and to discuss the readings you take at home with them. Some providers use an automated office blood pressure machine, which provide﻿s multiple readings over a series of intervals. This can be used in a quiet room without a medical professional present, hopefully reducing white coat hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring Some patients are referred for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, where your blood pressure is measured on a continuous basis for 24 hours as you live your daily life, even as you sleep. Your doctor will calculate the average blood pressure and also look at the range, how often readings are high or low, and if there is a “dip,” meaning a lowering of blood pressure﻿ during nighttime hours, which is normal.﻿ Ambulatory monitoring can be used for patients who have had high blood pressure readings but haven’t yet started treatment, need changes to their medications, or whose blood pressure is not responding to medications, or who have felt dizziness or have had fainting episodes. Green has used ambulatory monitoring herself and, to her surprise, found that she had high blood pressure during the workday. “I wouldn’t have known that I had high blood pressure while at work, and there are a lot of people walking around just like that whose hypertension wouldn’t have been caught otherwise,” Green added. It’s been shown both home monitors and the ambulatory monitors do a better job predicting heart attacks, strokes and death because they catch﻿ the variability in the average blood pressure much better th﻿an you can get from occasional blood pressure readings in the doctor’s office, Green said. Unfortunately, ambulatory monitoring can be difficult for some patients to access as it’s a subspecialty in medicine and not available in every doctor’s office, Cohen says. But studies have shown that home blood pressure monitoring﻿ with a store-bought monitor﻿ is a good surrogate for ambulatory. “It’s not expensive and everyone can do it.” Read more about home blood pressure monitoring.

Understand the common, and potentially emergency, causes of blurred vision in one eye By Kimberly Goad, AARP Medically reviewed by Merle Myerson, M.D. Comments Published December 18, 2024 Illustration: Remie Geoffroi Blurred vision. Not surprisingly — given its relationship to everyday vision-related woes like farsightedness, nearsightedness and astigmatism — it’s the most common sight-related symptom people report to their health care providers. But blurry vision in just one eye? That’s a different story. What’s known as unilateral blurry vision may be a sign of a medical emergency, particularly if this happens suddenly, and it should be checked out right away by your eye doctor or other health care provider. That’s especially true for people over age 50, since they’re already at risk for several conditions associated with blurry vision in one eye, says Ashley Brissette, M.D., assistant professor of ophthalmology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York Presbyterian Hospital. “Older individuals are generally at higher risk for blurry vision of all causes.” Yet another reason to keep up with regular eye exams so your eye doctor can check for early warning signs of these conditions before they lead to vision loss. “Many conditions in ophthalmology can affect only one eye, or one eye more severely than the other eye,” says Michelle Andreoli, M.D., spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a comprehensive ophthalmologist at Northwestern Medicine. “At an examination with an ophthalmologist, testing will be performed to examine the quality of the vision as well as the health structures of the eye. If a condition is affecting only one eye — or affecting one eye more severely — the vision will be different between the eyes, and an abnormality will be visible within the structures of the eye.” What can cause sudden blurry vision in one eye? The following potential culprits for sudden blurriness in one eye — key word: sudden — require immediate medical attention, says Andreoli. “Rapid, dramatic vision loss is often associated with conditions that progress quickly and severely affect vision.” They include: Stroke (Transient Ischemic Attack, OR TIA) Sudden trouble seeing in one eye — although trouble in both eyes can occur — is a hallmark symptom of a stroke or what’s known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a.k.a. a “mini stroke.” This can be accompanied by weakness, numbness and paralysis on one side of your body; dizziness, confusion or difficulty talking or understanding others; and a loss of balance and coordination. With a TIA, the symptoms generally last less than one hour, though they may linger longer, up to 24 hours. The symptoms may also come and go. Acting quickly can improve your chances of recovery from a stroke. The treatments that work best are available only if a stroke is diagnosed within hours of the first symptoms. Illustration: Remie Geoffroi Brain tumor Not all brain tumors reveal themselves in the same way. If a tumor is very small, for instance, you may not experience any symptoms, or the symptoms might be so insignificant you won’t notice them. As the tumor becomes larger, however, location plays a role in which of the many symptoms you may experience. When a tumor puts pressure on the visual processing area of the brain — what’s known as the occipital lobe — the result can be blurry vision, among other changes to your eyesight. Detached retina ​The retina is a structure at that back of the eye that has photoreceptors that help us to perceive color and provide central vision. When the retina pulls away from the layer of tissue at the back of the eye, the result is one or more vision-threatening symptoms, including flashing lights, floaters — and the sudden onset of blurred vision. “A retinal detachment is a condition associated with rapid and severe vision loss because often the entirety of the retina is affected in a short period of time,” says Andreoli. Getting treatment right away can reduce your risk for permanent vision loss. Closed-angle glaucoma Your eyes are filled with two substances that help keep them healthy. Glaucoma occurs when one of these substances, the gel-like vitreous humor, isn’t able to drain properly and causes pressure to build up. Unlike open-angle glaucoma, the far more common form of the disease, in which pressure builds up slowly over time, closed-angle glaucoma tends to come on suddenly﻿. The buildup of pressure on the optic nerve can cause permanent damage and vision loss and is considered a medical emergency. This type of glaucoma is more likely to occur in one eye and puts you at a higher risk of developing it in the other eye.​ Illustration: Remie Geoffroi Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Blurriness, wavy or crooked lines or even blank spots in your central vision can be a sign of AMD, a progressive eye disease that damages the macula, the part of the eye that controls straight-ahead vision. It can affect one or both eyes. And while dry AMD, the far more common form of the disease, comes on gradually, that’s not so with wet AMD. Blurry or distorted vision that comes on quickly is a classic sign of wet AMD. Video: Signs of Macular Degeneration Can dehydration cause blurry vision? Yes, indirectly. Dehydration, which is common among older people, can lead to renal, cognitive and metabolic problems. It can also lead to a common eye condition called dry eye syndrome, “one of the most common causes of blurry vision,” says Andreoli. Making matters worse, “significant dehydration can lead to decreases in blood pressure, which can also be associated with some of the more rapid vision changes.” When should I go to the doctor for blurry vision in one eye? Blurry vision in one eye can be a symptom of conditions ranging from the serious to the not so serious — and a few in between — making it hard to know when to seek medical care. The best clue you should call your eye doctor immediately is the most obvious one: The blurred vision came on suddenly. “Anytime a patient is aware of an abrupt vision change — pain in the eye, redness, new flashing lights or new floaters — [they] should immediately seek care from their ophthalmologist, as these can be indications of conditions that may be permanently vision threatening,” says Andreoli. How to fix one blurry eye? Treatment depends on the cause. “Sudden-onset eye emergencies from a known cause are treated more urgently,” says Usiwoma Abugo, M.D., spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an ophthalmologist at Katzen Eye Group in Lutherville, Maryland. “For example, if it’s caused by severe high blood pressure, interventions will be taken to rapidly restore eye health and overall health by reducing blood pressure. The same will be done for abnormal blood sugars or abnormally high cholesterol.” ​​If, on the other hand, the blurriness in one eye came on gradually, the treatment will be addressed by your ophthalmologist over a series of visits. Take, for instance, “the gradual onset of blurred vision from a cataract, something that is commonly related to normal aging,” says Abugo. “A cataract, which is a clouding of the lens of the eye, needs to be assessed by an eye surgeon or ophthalmologist, but it’s not frequently related to a life-threatening systemic condition.” Video: Signs of Macular Degeneration Kimberly Goad is a New York-based journalist who has covered health for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Keep in mind that BMI has its limits, and recommendations differ based on a few variables. For instance, your muscle tone plays a role as you age. And if you have a lot of fat around the middle, you may face additional health risks. Tips for People Over 50 Who Are a Healthy Weight Open All 1. Anticipate situations that cause weight gain — and have a plan To maintain a healthy weight, don’t let changing circumstances alter the number on the scale. Sustaining an injury or moving from a job where you’re on your feet all day to one at a desk, for instance, can be a recipe for weight gain. Adjust your calorie intake to account for the activity deficit. 2. Weigh yourself once a week Studies suggest that regular weigh-ins help prevent people from gaining weight. One reason: It’s easier to make an adjustment if you are up by 2 pounds than if you’ve gained 12. In general, people tend to gain 1 to 2 pounds per year, which can add up over time. 3. Ask about weight gain with new prescriptions The older you get, the more medications you may take. This can affect your BMI; many drugs list weight gain as a side effect. If you’re prescribed a drug known to put on pounds, ask your doctor for an alternative or suggestions for staying at a healthy weight when no substitute is available. 4. Stay active as you age Some research has shown that physical activity does even more than diet to maintain weight. You can even step it up a notch if you have more time in your schedule.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/reasons-to-wear-sunglasses/,"7 Surprising Reasons to Wear Sunglasses These cool shades can protect you from headaches, wrinkles, even cancer By Elise Ceyral, AARP Comments En español Published April 25, 2025 Stocksy Just as it can damage your skin, the sun can do a number on your eyes. Among other things, ultraviolet (UV) rays can increase your chances of contracting debilitating conditions like cataracts and even cancer. “I can honestly tell when somebody was born and raised in Florida [and] when they weren’t,” says Kimberly Caracci, an optometrist at the Cleveland Clinic Florida. She explains that she can tell apart her patients who spent years in the Florida sun just by the damage it did to their eyes. Still, no need to stay inside to avoid the sun’s harmful rays. Sunglasses are an efficient — and stylish — way to protect your peepers, as long as they provide 100 percent UVA and UVB protection. Here are 7 good reasons to wear them: UVA and UVB The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) radiation that can be harmful to our skin and eyes. UVA and UVB stand for different wavelengths that pose different risks to our body — including skin aging for UVA and sunburn for UVB. Both can increase your risk for skin cancer. 1. Not protecting your eyes on a sunny day could lead to eyestrain and headaches. You may have experienced this on a particularly bright day. “If I don’t wear sunglasses, and you tell me to drive for an hour in sunny conditions, I will certainly have a headache,” says Alister Gibbons, M.D., an ophthalmologist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and an associate professor at the University of Miami. Squinting because of the light could fatigue your eyes, which might in turn lead to eyestrain and headaches. 2. You can get skin cancer on your eyelids, too. The skin on your eyelids is the thinnest on your body, but it’s hard to protect it against the sun’s harmful rays. Putting sunscreen on your eyelids can lead to irritation or styes, Caracci says, which makes sunglasses a must. Protecting your eyelids with sunglasses could also slow your skin’s aging process and limit the formation of wrinkles. 3. The sun can cause small growths on your eyes. These small bumps, called pingueculae and pterygia, grow on the conjunctiva, which covers the white part of your eyes. The more you expose your eyes to the sun, the more likely you are to get one of these bumps. Wind and dust are also believed to cause their formation. While a pinguecula may contain deposits of protein, fat or calcium, the American Academy of Ophthalmology explains, a pterygium (also known as surfer's eye) is a growth of fleshy tissue that may start as a pinguecula. “If [a pterygium] grows close enough to the center of the cornea, it will very much drop your vision,” says Peter J. McDonnell, M.D., director of the Wilmer Eye Institute and a professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. UVA and UVB The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) radiation that can be harmful to our skin and eyes. UVA and UVB stand for different wavelengths that pose different risks to our body — including skin aging for UVA and sunburn for UVB. Both can increase your risk for skin cancer. 4. Your eyes, too, can get sunburnt. This condition is called photokeratitis. “It’s actually very common […] to see people that went skiing without any sort of eye protection literally burning their corneas,” Gibbons says. That specific condition is referred to as snow blindness, but your eyes can also get sunburnt at the beach from the sun’s reflection on the sand and water. “Fortunately, it’s temporary, and it usually doesn’t leave any lasting damage. But it can be extremely painful,” Gibbons says. 5. Sun exposure over time can increase your risk of developing cataracts. Everyone would get cataracts — a condition in which the eye’s lens becomes cloudy — if they lived long enough, McDonnell explains. But spending too much time in the sun could lead to an earlier onset of the disease. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 10 percent of cataracts may be caused by overexposure to UV light and could be avoided. 6. You can get melanoma in your eyes. Skin isn’t the only area of your body where you can get a dangerous cancer called melanoma. The choroid — the layer located between the white of the eye and the retina — contains a lot of melanocytes, the cells that produce and contain melanin. “They can start multiplying and cause very aggressive cancers that can make you lose [not only] your eye, your vision, but even your life,” Gibbons says. Ocular melanoma can also appear in the iris or ciliary body — sometimes even on the conjunctiva. People with light skin and eyes, as well as those over 50, are at higher risk, but the condition remains very rare. Specialists still don't know exactly what causes eye melanoma, but sun exposure may contribute to the development of the disease. 7. Sunglasses are not bad for your health. Gibbons says the myth that sunglasses can be harmful might have originated at a time when sunglasses didn’t offer 100 percent UVA and UVB protection. “Patients [would] wear the sunglasses, and their pupils would become a little bigger because it was less light coming in,” he says. “So, if your pupils are a little bit bigger, but you’re not blocking the UV light, you will get more [harmful light] into your eye.” But this won’t be an issue with most sunglasses today, he says, because nearly all sunglasses offer UVA and UVB protection. A Guide to Sunglasses Opt for sunglasses that provide 100 percent UVA and UVB protection (also referred to as UV 400). “Any sunglasses sold in the U.S. should meet that norm,” Gibbons says. But when in doubt, you can take your sunglasses to an optician, who can use a photometer to inspect your lenses. Wear sunglasses (almost) every time you’re out. A cloudy day doesn’t mean a UV-free day. “You can get a sunburn on a cloudy day, and you can get UV light in your eyes,” McDonnell says. This is especially true for people who spend a lot of time outside, like hikers, sailors, skiers or golfers. Don’t forget your hat (and sunscreen). A hat with a brim will help protect areas not covered by the sunglasses. “One of my professors years ago showed that if you have sunglasses on that are 100 percent UV absorbing, [you’ll only] block 60 percent of the UV, because a lot will come from above and underneath, reflect off your nose and get into your eye,” McDonnell says. “When I watch my ophthalmologist friends, almost all of the time, they’re wearing their sunglasses and a hat with a brim.” Contact lenses are not enough. Some contacts will offer UV protection, but they will leave many parts of the eye defenseless against the sun’s harmful rays. “Anything in front of the cornea, the surface of the eye, the eyelids, etc ... are not being protected by the contact lens,” Gibbons says.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/headaches-eyes/,"What’s Behind That Headache Behind Your Eyes? How to find relief from the pain and discomfort caused by migraine, eye strain, tension and sinus issues By Elise Ceyral, Updated February 03, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published September 15, 2020 / Updated February 03, 2025 Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images Blurry vision, dryness, itchiness — all are common eye complaints that may suggest an underlying problem. But perhaps the most uncomfortable, not to mention worrisome, symptom is pain behind the eyes. It can be a sign of a range of issues, including eye strain, migraine and sinus infections. Depending on the cause, there are ways to eliminate the ache and get some sweet relief. Some common causes of behind-the-eye pain and how to treat them: Eye strain • Migraines • Tension headaches • Sinusitis What causes eye strain? Our muscles aren’t the only part of our body that can become fatigued and sore after overuse. Eye strain can lead to eye pain. Reading without giving the eyes a rest, driving long distances, being exposed to glare (or straining to see in poor lighting) or coping with an underlying eye problem (say, uncorrected vision) can cause trouble. And then there are those digital devices. “When you look at anything intently, over a long period of time, you override your natural tendency to blink, which keeps eyes moist,” says Andrew Iwach, M.D., executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco and an associate clinical professor of ophthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco. “That can lead to dry eye or exacerbate an underlying dry eye condition, creating pain and discomfort.” How to relieve or prevent eye strain “Give your eyes a rest, get a good night’s sleep, and things usually get better on their own,” Iwach says. Here are a few other ways to get relief: Keep eyes lubricated. Over-the-counter artificial tears can lubricate the surface of the eye to prevent or relieve dryness. “Don’t wait until you have symptoms to use [the drops],” Iwach cautions. “If you tend to experience dry eye symptoms at 2 or 3 in the afternoon, start using artificial tears earlier in the day. You’ll be able to work longer and end up using less in the long run.” Paying attention to the environment you’re in and making sure the air isn’t too dry can also help, he says. Avoid digital eye strain. Glare can strain eyes, making it difficult to see objects on your monitor. Consider turning off some of the overhead lights or place an anti-glare cover over the screen. Also, keep the screen about an arm’s length away. “Make sure the monitor or laptop is at a comfortable height, just below eye level,” Iwach advises. During video calls, he adds, people tend to blink less to appear engaged: “Make it a habit to blink more often when looking at the monitor, and give eyes a break by looking away every now and then.” When you’re by yourself, apply the 20-20-20 rule: For every 20 minutes you spend in front of a screen, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Consult your doctor if symptoms persist. It’s always a good idea to see a specialist, Iwach says, as other conditions could be responsible for pain behind your eyes. “If you have any symptoms, call your ophthalmologist so we can take a look … for other potential eye issues,” he says. Some of them, such as glaucoma, can cause vision loss. Experts advise a thorough eye exam around age 40, and checkups at least every year or two after age 60, as many age-related eye conditions have no early symptoms but can be detected by a specialist. Some common causes of behind-the-eye pain and how to treat them: Eye strain • Migraines • Tension headaches • Sinusitis What causes migraines? Dubbed “the Mother of All Headaches,” migraines, which often manifests as extreme pain behind the eyes, affects one in 10 older adults. The three most common symptoms are: pain that interferes with your life, light sensitivity and nausea, says Kathleen Digre, M.D., professor of neurology and ophthalmology at the University of Utah’s John A. Moran Eye Center and a past president of the American Headache Society. “If you’ve got two of these three symptoms,” she says, “you’ve got a 90 percent chance of it being a migraine.” Migraine attacks are often triggered by changes: in weather, sleep patterns, eating habits, even hormonal changes during menopause can trigger migraines in women. Attacks can also be caused by sensory stimuli, such as bright light, loud noises and strong smells. “All of the senses are ramped up in a person with migraines,” Digre says. “These are people who can smell somebody's perfume from three pews away in church, and that can trigger a headache.” Keeping a migraine diary — noting when they start and what they feel like — can help you figure out what is setting off symptoms. How to relieve or prevent migraines Try medication. OTC pain relievers may help with mild discomfort, but most sufferers require prescription meds. Triptans, which should be taken at the first sign of an attack coming on, help block pain pathways to the brain. Lasmiditan, another option, improves pain as well as nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. (It’s similar to Triptan but safer for people with underlying cardiovascular diseases.) Your doc might also recommend calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies. They target and inactivate CGRP, a protein released by the nerves and blood vessels in the brain and known for carrying pain signals . They are administered as injectables. Gepants also target CGRP, but they are oral pills or dissolvable tablets designed for acute care and should be taken at the onset of an attack. The Food and Drug Administration recently approved a nasal spray, Zavegepant, that can bring relief within 30 minutes . Switch to brain-friendly lenses. About 80 percent of people who experience migraines also struggle with a heightened sensitivity to light. Some types of glasses can help soothe this symptom. “FL41 tinted lenses can block a certain wavelength of light that makes migraines worse,” Digre explains. Green light may also be beneficial. Try neuromodulation. The FDA has approved several wearable devices that stimulate nerves and modify the way they transport information to and from the brain to help decrease migraines. People with pacemakers should not use them. Neuromodulation on its own might not be able to make the migraines go away, but it can help reduce the number of medications you take. Avoid your triggers. Monosodium glutamate, or MSG, can cause a flare-up. “Caffeine is a two-edged sword,” Digre says. “Sometimes it can help, but if you take too much of it, it can actually give you a headache.” Other potential culprits: alcohol (especially fermented products, such as red wine, champagne or beer), aged cheeses, processed meats, chocolate and some artificial sweeteners (like aspartame). Your migraine diary can help you flag your personal triggers. Consider your magnesium intake. One study found that regularly getting magnesium into your system can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks by more than 40 percent. Have your doctor check your magnesium level to determine if you’re deficient. If you are, the American Headache Society suggests taking a 400–500 milligram supplement of magnesium oxide daily to prevent pain. But always ask your primary care doctor before starting any supplements, Digre says. Take time to relax. “Migraine sufferers need downtime, instead of being stimulated all the time,” Digre says. At the first sign of a slammer, take a break from your usual activities (if possible) and relax in a dark, quiet room. Apply a cold compress to your head, to dull the pain. There are even caps that you can buy (one called Icekap). “You slip hot or cold blue packs into the cap before putting it on,” she explains. “That works for some people, though it doesn’t always stop the nausea that comes with the migraine.” Exercise regularly. Exercise is a natural stress stopper that cues the body to release pain-killing endorphins. Bonus: These chemicals alleviate anxiety and depression, which can exacerbate migraines. Be sure you’re using good form (no slouching!), and don’t overexert yourself — both can trigger migraines. Healthy habits like this and eating right are key, Digre says. “I tell migraine sufferers, ‘You’ve got the Ferrari of brains. It’s sensitive and high-maintenance, and you’ve got to take care of it by living a balanced life.’ ” When to see a doctor How do you know if a headache is cause for concern? These “red flags” may suggest a more serious problem: If headaches are unusual for you but you start getting them after age 50. A different type of headache than you’re accustomed to, including a change in attack frequency or severity. These last three may require a trip to urgent care or the ER: A headache associated with weight loss, or a fever or chills, which may mean there’s an infection. A headache accompanied by confusion, impaired alertness, numbness, vision or speech problems, which could indicate a stroke. A sudden, split-second — or thunderclap — headache, which could be caused by a ruptured aneurysm, a weakened area in a blood vessel, according to the American Heart Association.

A sudden, split-second — or thunderclap — headache, which could be caused by a ruptured aneurysm, a weakened area in a blood vessel, according to the American Heart Association. What causes tension headaches? The most common type of headache, a tension one, produces a dull, aching pain that can feel like a band wrapped tightly around your forehead, causing tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles, and an ache behind the eyes. Some people experience tension headaches once or twice a month; others, more often. Stress, anxiety and fatigue are common culprits, and some of the lifestyle recommendations you’ve heard about migraines, like getting enough sleep or exercising regularly, can also help keep tension headaches at bay. Here are a few other strategies. How to relieve or prevent tension headaches Try medication. Tension headaches can usually be treated with simple OTC pain relievers. Take an aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen or acetaminophen at the first sign of tightness. However, don’t use OTC medications more than twice a week as you could trigger a rebound headache. If the pain is severe or you need medications more than twice a week, prescription meds may be necessary. Relieve the tension with massage. Have someone gently knead your head, neck and shoulder muscles. Or do it yourself with a targeted mini-massage, gently rubbing the painful spot on your head with your fingertips for a minute or two. You can also apply a heating pad set on low to your head for five to 10 minutes, as needed, or take a hot bath or shower, to relax tense muscles. Applying ice or a cool towel to your head can also help. Try relaxation. Keeping stress under control can help you manage your symptoms. If you feel overwhelmed, unwind with some slow stretches or deep breathing, or take a 15-minute walk around the neighborhood. A weekly yoga class can also help. Correct your posture. Poor posture can affect muscles in your neck and shoulders and could trigger tension-type headaches. Jaw clenching and teeth grinding could also be responsible for chronic tension-type headaches. Your dentist can check for signs of such conditions. What causes sinusitis? Anything that causes a buildup of pressure in your sinuses, such as congestion from a cold or allergy, can bring a painful pounding around the eyes as well as other parts of the face. Sinusitis is a sinus infection, with symptoms that can include postnasal drip and fever. It typically lasts two to four weeks. Sinusitis that lingers beyond 12 weeks, despite medical treatment, is considered chronic sinusitis. But if facial pain is the predominant symptom, you probably have a migraine disorder, not sinusitis, says Bradley Otto, M.D., an otolaryngologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in Columbus. How to relieve or prevent sinusitis Most people don’t need to see a doctor, as sinusitis usually goes away on its own and doesn’t require treatment beyond taking a short course of OTC painkillers or nasal sprays; hydrating well; applying warm face packs to ease decongestion; and resting. But if the infection lingers beyond 14 days, you might have a bacterial sinusitis and should see a doctor. Other ways to thwart pain and pressure: Steam your sinuses. Steam adds moisture to the air, helping to moisten your sinus passages and thin out thickened mucus. Take a hot shower and breathe in the steam, to reduce pressure. Place warm, damp towels around your nose, cheeks and eyes, to ease facial pain. For long-term relief, use a humidifier. Try nasal sprays. To help keep nasal passages open and reduce sinus pressure, use a nasal saline spray or steroid spray (like Flonase), which can loosen thick, dry mucus. You can also try a neti pot (a teakettle-like device used to irrigate the sinuses with a warm saline solution). “Just make sure you're using distilled, not tap, water,” Otto warns, and don’t flush more than once a day. Exercise. Staying active — particularly engaging in aerobic activities, such as walking, swimming and biking — can also relieve sinus pressure.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/long-covid-symptoms/,"Most Common Symptoms of Long COVID Plus, what to do when the effects of a coronavirus infection won’t go away By Rachel Nania, Updated June 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published May 19, 2022 / Updated June 17, 2024 AARP (Source: Getty Images) ﻿Millions of people who have had COVID-19 find themselves suffering from a host of debilitating symptoms that can persist for weeks or even months after their initial coronavirus infection fades. This phenomenon, known as long COVID, has puzzled experts since near the start of the pandemic. And while research is starting to shore up some answers, Greg Vanichkachorn, M.D., formerly with Mayo Clinic, says, “we don’t really have [long COVID] nailed down yet.” A new definition for long COVID On June 11, 2024, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a new, universal definition for long COVID. The group defines long COVID as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” A big reason is because “it looks like more and more symptoms can be associated with this condition,” says Vanichkachorn, an occupational and aerospace medicine specialist who was the medical director of Mayo Clinic’s COVID Activity Rehabilitation Program and is now a physician with Delta Air Lines. In fact, the list of the most commonly reported long COVID symptoms maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes nearly 20, ranging from neurological complications to digestive disorders. Some studies have uncovered more than 50 long-term effects of COVID-19, adding issues such as hair loss and vision loss to the mix. Others estimate that number is much higher — closer to 200. Still, some symptoms seem to be more prevalent. A study published May 25, 2023, in the journal JAMA identified 12 symptoms that most set apart people with and without long COVID. They are: Post-exertional malaise, or the worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion — even minor effort. Fatigue. Brain fog.Dizziness.Gastrointestinal symptoms. Heart palpitations.Issues with sexual desire or capacity.Loss of smell or taste.Thirst.Chronic cough.Chest pain.Abnormal movements. New research from AARP reflects similar findings, with older adults reporting that their most common long COVID symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, cough, and loss of taste or smell. Results from the survey, published Feb. 6, 2024, show that nearly 1 in 5 adults ages 50 and older have experienced long COVID. Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID A new definition for long COVID On June 11, 2024, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested a new, universal definition for long COVID. The group defines long COVID as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” Video: Why Fatigue After Workouts May Signal Long COVID Symptoms can be life altering The symptoms, however, are only “half the picture,” Vanichkachorn says. “The other half is how those symptoms really have changed a person’s ability to live their normal lives.” A handful of viruses can cause prolonged illness (experts call this post-acute sequelae), and recovery can be especially difficult for people who required hospitalization or intensive care. But what’s different about long COVID is that it seems to be more widespread, and the symptoms that people experience, even when they no longer test positive for coronavirus, seem to be more robust, Vanichkachorn says. “We’ve had patients complain of fatigue after a viral infection before … but patients after coronavirus infection, they really have some profound fatigue.” For some, this means routine tasks such as getting dressed or taking a shower require assistance. Others have trouble completing everyday errands like grocery shopping or doing the laundry due to their symptoms — “and of course, going to work,” Vanichkachorn adds. Among adults 50 and older living with long COVID, 21 percent say it has had a major impact on their physical health;﻿ 18 percent say it has affected their mental health. Twenty percent of older adults surveyed by AARP say long COVID has impacted their social life. Priya Duggal, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, estimates that 3 to 5 percent of people who have had COVID-19 “feel they cannot function normally in everyday life” due to lasting symptoms. Some people may be at higher risk A few folks may be more at risk for long COVID than others, though Duggal emphasizes that “no one gets a free pass.” People who had underlying health conditions before their coronavirus infection may be more likely to develop long COVID, the CDC says. Research also finds that more women report long COVID symptoms than men, and it tends to be more prevalent in middle-aged adults. According to the CDC, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to get long COVID than people who received the vaccine. And research, while still ongoing, has also shown that people who treat COVID-19 with an antiviral like Paxlovid are less likely to experience lingering symptoms. “When you’re vaccinated or when you treat yourself early on, the burden of virus is much less, and, therefore, I think you are less likely to go on to develop these longer-term symptoms,” says Paul Offit, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and author of the book Tell Me When It’s Over: An Insider’s Guide to Deciphering COVID Myths and Navigating our Post-Pandemic World. “So I think anything that decreases viral replication — whether it’s vaccination or whether it is early treatment — is a value.” Talk to your doctor early if you experience symptoms Lots of questions surrounding long COVID are still unanswered, but one thing is certain: Experts say if you had COVID-19 and notice any new or prolonged symptoms three or four weeks out from your infection, talk to your primary care physician. Don’t wait months before calling for an appointment, Vanichkachorn says. If you don’t have a primary care provider, seek care from an internist, Duggal adds. There isn’t a one-size-fits all treatment for long COVID, Offit says, and that’s because there likely isn’t just one cause. Right now, a lot of it comes down to managing individual symptoms and providing supportive care, and Vanichkachorn says the earlier you start that treatment, the better. AARP research, however, found that less than half of the adults surveyed saw their health care provider to address their ongoing COVID-related symptoms. It’s also important for people with chronic health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes to reach out to their doctor if they notice a change in their numbers after recovering from COVID-19, says Sabyasachi Sen, M.D., professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. It could signal a long-term effect from the infection. The CDC has tips for patients on how to plan for an appointment to discuss long COVID. The agency recommends preparing a list of your current and past medical conditions in advance, and writing down your experience with COVID-19 and any new or lingering conditions. Be sure to include: When they started.How they affect your life.How often they occur.What makes them worse. Finally, bring a list of your current medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to your appointment, and ask questions when you have them. ﻿ Editor’s Note: This story, first published on May 19, 2022, has been updated with new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-2024/medicare-inflation-drug-price-reduction.html,"64 Medicare Prescription Drugs That Are Getting More Affordable The coinsurance rates for certain Part B medications are being lowered temporarily. Here’s why By Rachel Nania, Updated December 23, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 30, 2024 / Updated December 23, 2024 AARP (Source: Getty Images (2)) Some people with Medicare could end up spending less money on potentially lifesaving medications in the beginning of the new year. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that 64 drugs available through Medicare Part B will have a lower coinsurance rate between Jan. 1 and March 31, 2025, since the prices set by their manufacturers have risen faster than the rate of inflation. Drugs that fall under Part B are typically administered in a doctor’s office or hospital and can include cancer treatments, Alzheimer’s treatments and injectable osteoporosis medications. Under a provision in the AARP-backed prescription drug law passed in 2022, the coinsurance rates for these 64 medications will be 20 percent of what the price would have been if it increased with inflation, which will be less than what the beneficiary would pay otherwise. Drugmakers will also face penalties for the price hikes in the form of a rebate to Medicare, and these funds will be used to help ensure the sustainability of the national health insurance program that provides coverage to more than 67 million Americans who are older or have a disability. Some could see significant savings More than 853,000 people with Medicare use the 64 selected drugs annually to treat conditions such as cancer, osteoporosis and substannce use disorder. According to HHS, some people with Medicare taking these medications could see savings in the last quarter of the year that range from $1 a day to more than $10,800 a day. How much each person pays for their medications varies, depending on whether they have additional insurance that covers or reduces Part B’s 20 percent coinsurance. The list price for some of these drugs is hundreds of thousands of dollars per treatment. “By discouraging drug companies from raising their prices faster than inflation, we are keeping prices affordable for the people with Medicare who rely on these drugs to live healthier lives,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. The Medicare Prescription Drug Inflation Rebate Program is just one provision under the 2022 law that’s aimed at lowering drug prices and related out-of-pocket costs. The law also gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for certain prescription medications. The first batch of negotiations included 10 common and costly medications, and when the lower prices take effect in 2026 they will save people with Medicare prescription drug plans a collective $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket expenses, health officials project. Another key provision in the law caps annual out-of-pocket prescription drug expenses at $2,000 starting Jan. 1. The new limit is expected to benefit nearly 3.2 million older Americans with a Medicare prescription drug plan in 2025, AARP research found. That number will swell to more than 4 million in 2029. “The Inflation Reduction Act is lowering prescription drug costs so that people can access the medications they need,” Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said in a news release. “As we head into 2025, people with Medicare will feel substantial relief from high drug prices."" 64 drugs subject to coinsurance rate adjustments ​ Adjustments will take effect Jan. 1 to March 31, 2025 AbecmaAdcetrisAkynzeo CapsuleAtgamAveedBerinertBicillin C-RBicillin L-ABlincytoBreyanziBrixadi (Monthly Dosing)Brixadi (Weekly Dosing)CarvyktiChirhostimCresembaCrysvitaCyclophosphamide (Dr. Reddy)DigifabElfabrioEnvarsus XREvenityFolotynFosaprepitantFragminFyarroGemcitabine (Accord)HizentraImlygicIxempraKepivanceKrystexxaKymriahKyprolisLeukineLupron Depot-PedMeropenem (B.

And while actual changes in eye color are rare, they can also indicate an underlying health disorder that needs to be addressed. “Eyes can appear to change color due to an undiagnosed disease, a new medication or even trauma,” says David Silverstone, M.D., a professor of ophthalmology at the Yale School of Medicine. Sometimes, he adds, it’s due to an actual change in the iris, the colored part of your eye, and sometimes it’s due to something going on in another part of your eye that appears to change the eye color. Here’s a look at what your eye color can mean for your health. Can eye color predict your health? Your eye color may offer some clues about how likely you are to develop certain cancers, or certain forms of eye disease, later on. Here’s what the research shows: Those with lighter eyes have higher skin cancer risk. A 2022 study published in Cancer Causes and Control that looked at more than 35,000 men found that, compared to people with dark eyes, those with hazel, green or blue eyes had higher risk of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, two of the most common forms of skin cancer. The men with hazel or green eyes had a 24 percent higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma, while those with blue eyes had a 19 percent higher risk. People who have less pigment in their eyes tend to have less pigment in their skin, which raises risk of skin cancer, says Davinder Grover, M.D., a Dallas ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology﻿. Not surprisingly, other research also suggests that folks with light-colored irises (blue or green) have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma than those with darker orbs. People with brown eyes have a lower incidence of macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.﻿ Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an age-related condition in which a part of your retina, the macula, is damaged. This causes you to lose your central vision so that you cannot see fine details. It’s the leading cause of vision loss in people age 50 and older. Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes-related condition that affects the blood vessels in your retina; over time, it can cause vision loss. It may be that pigment itself offers some protection, Grover says. The American Academy of Ophthalmology says those with brown eyes have a lower incidence of both of these conditions. People with dark eyes may be more likely to develop cataracts. You’re not off the hook if you have dark eyes: Research suggests you’re more likely to develop cataracts. Studies have found that people with dark brown eyes have a higher risk of cataracts than those with lighter-colored eyes, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Researchers aren’t sure why this might be true. The authors of one review study speculated that the increased melanin in the irises of brown-eyed people could cause a buildup of heat in the eyes that is linked to cataracts. It’s also possible that the higher risk of cataracts in those with brown eyes may not be directly related to eye color but to where those people live. “We know there is a connection between sun exposure and cataracts, and most people with darker eyes live closer to the equator,” Grover says. More research needs to be done to understand the link, but no matter the color of your eyes, you should wear sunglasses that provide 100 percent protection from all UV light, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. More on Eye Health Keep your eyes healthy Understanding eye anatomy and vision When and why you should get an eye exam 10 diseases eye dilation can spot Age-related eye problems Age-related macular degeneration Facts about glaucoma What does eye color say about health What changes in eye color may mean for your health If you notice any change in your eye color, you should always get it checked out by your eye doctor, Grover stresses. It can indicate a wide range of conditions, some benign, some potentially serious. They include: 1. A hazy blue or white ring that forms around your cornea This condition, called arcus senilisis, is caused by a build-up of lipids, or fat, in your eye. Most older adults develop it, and it’s usually harmless, Grover says. But it can make your eyes appear a different color. Grover recalls patients brought in by younger relatives concerned that the patients’ brown eyes had turned blue. If you do notice this ring, it’s always good to let both your eye doctor and your primary care provider know, since it can be a sign of high cholesterol. 2. Pigment loss Certain eye conditions can cause your orbs to lose pigment over time, Grover says. One is pigmentary glaucoma, a condition where pigment rubs off of the back of your iris, raising eye pressure. It can also happen after cataract surgery: “If a lens is placed in the wrong position, it can cause pigment to be released into the eye,” Grover says. Both are treatable, so it’s very important to see your eye doctor if you notice any symptoms, such as halos or blurred vision. 3. Iris freckles Just like you get freckles on your skin from sun exposure, you can also get them on your eye, Grover says. These are small brown spots on your iris that can make your eyes look like they’ve changed color. They’re harmless but should be checked out by an eye doctor. You can also develop iris nevi, which are dark growths on your eye that look like a mole and are in fact caused by the same pigment cells, called melanocytes. While most aren’t dangerous, they can raise your risk of developing eye cancer. 4. Red in the clear covering over your eye Uveitis is an inflammation of the middle layer of your eyeball. It can be caused by an infection such as shingles, or from an inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Most often, it just makes your conjunctiva — the clear covering over your eye — look red, Grover says. But it can also make your eye color look different if the inflammation causes your iris to stick to your lens. If you notice any redness or eye color changes, accompanied by light sensitivity, blurry vision and/or seeing floaters, contact your eye doctor right away because uveitis can be serious; it can even lead to vision loss. 5. Large ﻿black pupils If you’ve had a blow to the eye, damage to the iris can cause tissue loss that makes the eye appear as if it’s a different color. “If the trauma is bad enough, the pupil might stay dilated, which can make the eye appear black,” Silverstone says. If this happens, it’s very important that you see your doctor for medical treatment, and also to rule out another serious condition that could cause dilated pupils such as a brain injury or stroke. 6. Different-colored eyes caused by different pupil sizes This very rare condition affects the eye and surrounding tissue on only one side of the face. It’s usually due to a stroke, tumor or spinal cord injury. One symptom is uneven pupil size, which can make it look like you have different-colored eyes, Grover says. 7. Clouding of the lens Cataracts can cause a clouding of the eye lens that can make your eye look milky white, Silverstone says. About a quarter of people in their late 60s will have a cataract, and more than a third of people in their 70s, according to the National Eye Institute. Cataracts can easily be removed with surgery. 8. Brown eyes becoming darker, hazel eyes turning brown If you have glaucoma, the first-line treatment is often a class of medications called prostaglandins that can change eye color. “It can make brown or hazel eyes turn more brown or a darker shade of brown,” says Grover, who notes that it doesn’t usually cause color changes in blue or green eyes. If you use the lash-growing prescription medication Latisse, you may notice these changes, too, Silverstone adds. It’s important to remember that while your grandbaby’s eyes may have changed color from lighter to darker during the first year of life, as their body develops pigment, your eyes should stay constant. That’s why if you notice any eye color changes, don’t panic, but do get them checked out. Editor's note: This story, originally published Sept. 8, 2022, has been updated with new information.

Getty Images (12) There may be no such thing as a “perfect” food, but nuts and seeds come close. These nutritional nuggets contain omega-3 fatty acids and other unsaturated fats to help reduce inflammation and promote heart health says registered dietitian Jessica Cording. With 3 to 7 grams of protein per ounce, nuts and seeds help fuel muscle maintenance and repair. They also keep you feeling full, helping with weight management. But, in addition, these morsels have an unsung superpower: They help protect your brain. In part, that’s due to their mix of healthy fats and antioxidants. But it’s also a function of their fiber content. “Eating enough fiber from food helps maintain a more balanced microbiome, which supports overall physical and mental well-being,” says Uma Naidoo, M.D., a nutritional psychiatrist and author of This Is Your Brain on Food. Because nuts are high in calories, keep your snacking to about 1 ounce (¼ cup) of nuts per day; that’s about 23 almonds or 14 walnut halves. Here are Naidoo’s choices for top nuts and seeds to keep your brain sharp. 1. Chia seeds and flaxseeds are very rich in omega 3-fatty acids in the form of ALA, or alpha-linolenic acid, which research suggests supports brain health. Use ground flaxseed to maximize your body’s ability to digest it. 2. Walnuts might be shaped like little brains for a reason: They provide higher amounts of ALA than any other nut. Emerging research also links regular intake of walnuts with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms and improved mood, says registered sports dietitian Kelly Jones. Like other nuts and seeds, they’re also rich in protein and fiber. 3. Pistachios have a positive affect on the brain’s ability to generate brain waves, including gamma waves, which are critical for cognition and memory, researchers at Loma Linda University found. Among the nuts they tested, pistachios had the greatest effect on gamma waves. 4. Almonds are by far the most potent source of vitamin E among all the nuts. Low intake of vitamin E has been linked to an increase in dementia risk. 5. Brazil nuts are a great source of selenium, an antioxidant that has been associated with improved brain health, says Cording. Just one a day will more than cover your daily need of 55 mcg. 6. Pine nuts are rich in a rare and specific fat called pinolenic acid, which has been shown to reduce inflammation levels.﻿ Raw or ﻿roasted? “You may have heard it’s better to eat raw nuts and seeds. But there’s not a big advantage, healthwise, so choose what you enjoy. “It’s more important that someone is consuming nuts and seeds at all,” says dietitian Jessica Cording. What if You’re Allergic to Tree Nuts? An estimated 3.9 million Americans are allergic to tree nuts, including almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, hazelnuts, pistachios and walnuts. That doesn’t mean they can’t enjoy similar health benefits by eating seeds, Jones says. “Roasted pumpkin seeds and hemp seeds are excellent additions to oatmeal, salads and side dishes, while flax and chia seeds are great blended into smoothies as well as oatmeal and baked goods,” she adds. Dry-roasted nuts, which are roasted without any oil, have a nutrient profile similar to raw ones. You can dry-roast nuts at home to enhance their flavor and texture; most do well baked at about 300°F until fragrant, about 10 to 25 minutes. (Different nuts cook at different rates.) There’s one caveat, though: “Do not overcook them, as that can reduce their antioxidant potential,” says dietitian Kelly Jones. Whether you’re buying whole nuts or nut butters, the same rules apply. “Look for products with as few ingredients as possible—ideally just the nuts or seeds,” Cording says. If you see oils (such as palm oil), preservatives or added sugar, keep looking. What if You’re Allergic to Tree Nuts?

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/heat-wave-dangers/,"Extreme Heat View Series How Extreme Heat Affects the Body After 50 Soaring temperatures can set off a cascade of life-threatening events. Here’s how to stay safe By Rachel Nania, Updated June 17, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published July 26, 2022 / Updated June 17, 2024 Getty Images It’s not your imagination: It really is hotter than when you were a kid. In fact, 2023 was the hottest year on record since 1850, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And the nine years from 2014 to 2022 round out the top 10 warmest. Climate experts warn that bouts of extreme heat are going to become more common as global temperatures continue to rise. That’s bad news for the growing population of older adults, who are more likely to get sick from heat — even die from it. In 2023, soaring temps sent nearly 120,000 people in the U.S. to emergency rooms, a 2024 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. Heat-related deaths have been increasing in recent years, with approximately 2,302 occurring in 2023, up from 1,722 in 2022, according to federal data, though other research suggests the number is much higher. A study published in 2020 in the journal Environmental Epidemiology finds an average of 5,608 deaths are attributable to heat each year. A study from a team of Duke University researchers estimates that 12,000 Americans die annually from heat-related causes. Regardless of the total tally, most people who die from the heat are over the age of﻿ 50, the National Institute on Aging says. “It has everything to do with our body’s ability to deal with heat as we age,” Aaron Bernstein, M.D., told AARP in 2022, when he was the interim director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Bernstein is now the director of the National Center for Environmental Health and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry at the CDC. “People who are older, our bodies may not be able to dissipate heat as well as people who are younger. We also tend to have more chronic health problems and may take more medications that affect our body’s ability to deal with heat.” Here’s a closer look at why heat is such a health risk for older adults, and what you can do to stay safe as heat waves become more frequent. Cooling down the body becomes harder People get into trouble when they can’t cool themselves down. That’s when heat exhaustion can occur, often marked by dizziness, fatigue and a weak, rapid pulse. If that goes untreated, heatstroke can set in, bringing with it the potential for long-term organ damage or death. Sweating is the top way that humans cool themselves, Bernstein says. It’s not the sweat itself that is particularly cooling but rather the evaporation process. It takes energy to evaporate sweat off the skin, and the energy source in this equation is heat. So as sweat switches from liquid to vapor, heat leaves your body and you start to cool down. At-risk adults on the rise Temperatures are increasing and so is the aging population. By 2050, roughly 200 million more older adults worldwide are expected to face exposure to dangerous heat, compared with now, research published in Nature Communications suggests. “The effects are projected to be the most severe in Asia and Africa, which may also have the lowest adaptive capacities,” Deborah Carr, professor of sociology at Boston University and a coauthor of the study, said in a statement. Sweat glands become less effective with age. “They can’t pump out as much sweat as quickly,” Daniel Van Durme, M.D., former chief medical officer at the Florida State University College of Medicine, told AARP. ﻿ What’s more, several medications common among older adults can interfere with how efficiently the body sweats or handles heat, Van Durme said, including some antihistamines (to ease allergy symptoms) and drugs used to treat overactive bladder. Certain antidepressants and some blood pressure medicines can also hinder the body’s ability to cool itself — and experts say there are likely many more that inflict this effect. Another disadvantage for older adults is heat’s impact on the heart. Hand in hand with sweating, the body releases heat by increasing blood flow to the skin to push the heat away from the core. This requires the heart to work harder. “And if you have heart disease, that puts strain on an already potentially weak heart,” Bernstein says. “So you see people during heat events having heart attacks, arrhythmias, strokes — there’s a big risk for that.” At-risk adults on the rise Temperatures are increasing and so is the aging population. By 2050, roughly 200 million more older adults worldwide are expected to face exposure to dangerous heat, compared with now, research published in Nature Communications suggests. “The effects are projected to be the most severe in Asia and Africa, which may also have the lowest adaptive capacities,” Deborah Carr, professor of sociology at Boston University and a coauthor of the study, said in a statement. More than 20 million adults in the U.S. have the most common type of heart disease, federal statistics show, and its prevalence increases with age. Nearly half of U.S. adults are affected by diseases of the heart and blood vessels, the American Heart Association reports. A study published in 2023 in the journal Circulation found that the risk of a fatal heart attack among older adults in Jiangsu province, China, was higher during two- and four-day heat waves. The most dangerous days were those of extreme heat and high levels of air pollution, including pollution from wildfires. The researchers estimated that up to 2.8 percent of heart attack deaths may be attributed to the combination. Dehydration amps up the danger Hydration plays a major role when it comes to staying healthy in extreme heat. You need fluid to produce the sweat that cools you down; it’s also essential to keeping the cells functioning and the organs running. Older adults have a harder time staying hydrated, mostly because of a decreased sense of thirst that sets in as you age, says Eric De Jonge, M.D., director of geriatrics at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. Certain medications that draw fluid from the body — including diuretics, used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, and laxatives — can further complicate matters. When you’re dehydrated, the kidneys “can spiral into dysfunction,” kicking off a domino effect of destruction throughout the body, Bernstein says. Dehydration is especially risky for the nearly 40 percent of U.S. adults 65 and older who already have kidney disease. Bernstein urges caution among those who routinely take medications that are hard on the kidneys, including over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen. In addition to kidney disease, another chronic condition that can be worsened by dehydration is diabetes, which the CDC says affects an estimated 29 percent of U.S. adults 65 and older and roughly 19 percent of those ages 45 to 64. Blood sugar becomes more concentrated when there’s less water in the body, the CDC explains, and it becomes “incredibly difficult” to manage blood sugar levels, Bernstein says. Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration Even the brain feels heat’s effects: The part that’s responsible for long-term planning “goes on vacation,” Bernstein says, “and the part of your brain that is in crisis mode is calling the shots.” Judgment can become impaired, and injuries may ensue. To stay safe, make a plan for high-heat days The list of health complications that can arise when temperatures rise seems never-ending — add to it that hot air can aggravate the lungs and trigger breathing issues, even in people who aren’t prone to respiratory distress — but experts say a little planning can go a long way when it comes to staying safe during summer. Here’s what you can do: Check the heat forecast. New this year, the CDC has a dashboard that can show you the heat risk in your community. Just type in your ZIP code, and check the forecast. Pay attention to humidity. There isn’t a single temperature at which things get dangerous, experts say — so much depends on what an individual is used to and how their body acclimates to heat. But one thing that can ramp up the danger is humidity, since sweat, the body’s cooling mechanism, “doesn’t want to evaporate into air that’s got a lot of water in it already,” Bernstein says. Video: 5 Signs of Dehydration As a rule of thumb, “85 [degrees] and humid is when we start to really think a lot and talk to our patients and families a lot about preventive measures,” De Jonge says. Talk to your doctor about your medications. If you take a medication that can affect how your body deals with heat, don’t stop taking it just because high temperatures are on the horizon. “The dangers of stopping may be far worse,” Van Durme warned. Instead, take extra caution in the heat, he says. Your doctor may decide to switch up your medications during the warmer months. Drink past the point of thirst — and get creative with hydration. Don’t use thirst as your guide for hydration because “by the time you feel thirsty, you are already significantly dehydrated,” Van Durme said. The color of your urine is a good indicator of whether you’re well hydrated. Thumbs-up if it’s a pale yellow; bottoms up if it’s dark yellow or orange, De Jonge says. That’s a sign you need to keep drinking — just not alcohol or caffeine. You don’t have to limit yourself to water. Cold fruit — think watermelon and cantaloupe — can boost your hydration levels. Mixing in fruit juice can keep things more interesting for people who get tired of plain water. Have a fan handy. If you don’t have air-conditioning — or even if you do — fans can keep you cool by helping sweat to quickly evaporate from the body. But when the temperature is above a certain level, they’re not very helpful. “When the temperature is hotter outside than in our bodies, fans work like a convection oven; we’re actually blowing heat in,” Bernstein says. A cool shower or bath is another way to cool off at home when things get too warm. Pay attention to your thermostat. If you have a chronic health condition that could put you at higher risk for heat-related illness and the temperature in your home is over 80 degrees, “you need to do something,” Bernstein says. That might mean turning on a fan, relocating to a cooler level in your home or building, or going to an air-conditioned space, even if it’s a neighbor’s house. Know your cooling centers. Many communities set up centers during heat waves to provide a safe space for people to cool down. Identify the closest one, and plan how to get there if you need to use it. If you have pets, check to see whether they’re welcome, says Diane Garcia-Gonzales, a research scientist with the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was part of a team that created community heat maps so state residents can stay informed about heat events in their areas. Don’t forget about other air-conditioned spaces — a church, a library, even a trip to the grocery store or the mall can provide relief. Have a backup plan. It’s always good to have a plan in place in case your air-conditioning goes out or your electricity fizzles and your home starts to heat up, Garcia-Gonzales says. Of course, this depends on whether the issue is widespread. If it’s limited, identify a place where you know you and the members of your household can stay cool. If your air-conditioning goes out during a hot stretch, don’t try to wait out the wave before getting it fixed. Know the warning signs of heat illness — and what to do. Watch out for confusion and slurred speech. Neurological issues mean you need to get to an emergency room. “That’s the one that you don’t want to mess with,” Van Durme said. If someone just needs to sit down — maybe gets a little woozy but is able to carry on a conversation — get them to cool off by moving them into an air-conditioned place or positioning them near a fan. And get them to drink. Another thing: Pay attention to others around you. If you’re at an event or gathering and one person goes down from the heat, “then everybody’s at risk,” Van Durme said. Check in on others. Finally, if you have a neighbor, friend or family member who’s at higher risk for heat-related illness, check in on them when things get warm to make sure they’re keeping up their fluids and staying cool and comfortable. “There’s no substitute for the human, in-person daily visits,” De Jonge says. Heat Exhaustion Vs. Heat Stroke Getting overheated can be dangerous. Keep an eye out for these warning signs.

Beginning around age 40, the eye lens can begin to cloud, but you typically don’t notice a change until after 60. By 80, more than half of all Americans will either have cataracts or have had cataract surgery. “I liken cataracts to wrinkles and gray hair,” says Anupama Horne, M.D., an ophthalmologist and eye surgeon at Duke University in Durham, N.C. “In the end, nearly everyone will develop them.” But the good news is that today’s high-tech procedures restore clear vision in about 97 percent of the close to 4 million Americans who undergo cataract surgery every year. Sarah Peng/AARP What happens in the eye when you have a cataract? Imagine a broken lens on a camera. “No matter how much you try to focus the camera, if the lens is broken, you’ll get a blurry picture,” says John Bartlett, M.D., an ophthalmologist and eye surgeon at UCLA Stein Eye Institute in Los Angeles. Cataracts occur when proteins in the lens of the eye break down, causing the normally clear lens to become cloudy. Getty Images The lens in your eye works like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina then sends nerve signals to the brain, allowing you to see clearly both up close and far away. Over time, as we age, proteins in the lens to clump together, clouding the lens. This cloudiness, known as a cataract, gradually makes it harder to see as it grows larger and thicker. Cataracts usually develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Unlike infections, they don’t spread from one eye to the other. What causes cataracts? Aging is the most common cause of cataracts, but other culprits can contribute, including certain medications, chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and poor lifestyle habits, like smoking or exposure to too much ultraviolet light from the sun. Family history also plays a role. Because age-related cataracts generally develop over time, worsening vision may not be noticeable in the very early stages. But as the clear lens of the eye slowly turns a yellowish/brownish color, the increased tinting may make it more difficult to read and colors seem faded. Other symptoms include blurry or double vision, glare — when headlights, lamps or sunlight appear blindingly bright — and poor night vision that can make driving hazardous. “It’s like a piece of clear plastic becomes yellowed and discolored,” says Bartlett. “As new layers are added, it becomes denser and harder.” Three types of cataracts Like an onion, the lens is composed of multiple layers. The outermost is known as the capsule. The layer inside the capsule is called the cortex. And the innermost layer is the nucleus. The three types of cataracts are named for their location in the lens: Posterior capsular: Unlike the other two, this type of cataract, found in the back outer layer of the lens, tends to develop rapidly. Cortical: Located in the outer layer of the lens surrounding the nucleus. Picture a wedge or a spoke — that’s what a cortical cataract looks like to your eye doctor. Nuclear: As the name suggests, this type of cataract is found in the innermost layer at the center of the lens. The nucleus tends to darken with age, changing from clear to yellow and sometimes brow Sarah Peng/AARP Getty Images Three types of cataracts Like an onion, the lens is composed of multiple layers.

If you’re keeping up with regular eye exams—for people 50 and older, that means a comprehensive exam every year or two, depending on your specific age, overall health and risk factors for eye disease—your doctor will be on the lookout for the symptoms above. Cataracts are usually identified with the help of a visual acuity test, where you read letters of varying sizes off an eye chart. This measures the sharpness and clarity of your vision, and how well you can see at various distances. You’ll also be given a dilated eye exam, in which drops are used to dilate and widen the pupils, offering your eye doctor a clearer view of the back of your eye. Your doctor will then use a specialized magnifying microscope known as a slit-lamp to examine your cornea, iris, and lens to look for signs of cataracts, as well as examine the retina and optic nerve for evidence of eye damage and other problems such as glaucoma. Other tests may include measuring the pressure within the eye as well as tests to check color vision and glare sensitivity. Treatment of cataracts When cataracts are in their early stages, you may be able to find relief with a new eyeglass prescription, brighter lighting, antiglare sunglasses or magnifying lenses. But once the cataract progresses and symptoms are interfering with your daily activities — reading, driving, watching TV — then surgery to remove the cataract is the only alternative. “Don’t get fooled by scams,” says Bartlett. “I see ads for eye drops, usually homeopathic, that purport to get rid of cataracts. The only treatment to remove cataracts is surgical.” Before you undergo the procedure, your surgeon may have you see your family doctor for a thorough medical exam to make sure you’re stable enough for surgery, says Ravi Goel, M.D., a New Jersey eye surgeon and clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Cataract surgery is considered low risk, even in patients who have certain heart and lung conditions. The procedure does not require major incisions or general anesthesia. What to expect from surgery Before: A week before surgery, your doctor will test your eyes to measure the curve of the cornea and the size and shape of your eye. The information will help determine which type of artificial lens — known as an intraocular lens (IOL) — is right for you. Your lifestyle will also play a role. For instance: When you think about how you like to spend your day, what vision needs are most important to you—reading, driving, or using a computer? The answer to that question will help guide the selection of an IOL, which includes: The monofocal IOL, the most common type of lens, provides clear vision at one distance (usually a far-off distance) meaning you’d require glasses for near or intermediate tasks.The toric IOL corrects astigmatism in addition to providing focusing power.The multifocal IOL—as the name suggests—provides clear vision at multiple distances, potentially reducing the need for glasses.The extended depth of focus IOL improves vision across a range of distances, often with fewer side effects than multifocal IOLs. A week before surgery, you may also need to temporarily stop taking certain medications. If you have cataracts in both eyes, each eye will be treated at a separate time to allow for healing. During: The surgery itself takes less than an hour and is generally an outpatient procedure, performed under local anesthesia to numb the nerves in and around the eye. The operation involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with a clear, artificial one (the IOL). Your surgeon will use tiny tools to cut into your eye, break up the lens, take it out, and place the new artificial lens in your eye. (See “Four types of cataract surgery,” below.) After: With most people, vision improves quickly, and colors appear more vivid. Normal activities can be resumed, although an eyepatch over the eye may need to be worn for several nights while sleeping. Itching and mild discomfort are normal, and eyes may feel sensitive to light and touch. However, these unpleasant aftereffects should diminish within a day or two. Eye drops will need to be administered to help with healing and decrease the risk of infection; an eye shield or eyeglasses may be worn to protect the eyes.

Jacopin / BSIP / Science Source (3) Four types of cataract surgery Phacoemulsification Cataract Surgery: As one of the most common types of cataract surgery, phacoemulsification involves creating a small incision approximately 2 to 3 millimeters across the eye. A probe is inserted and ultrasound is used to break up the damaged lens into tiny pieces. The lens is then suctioned out of the eye with a vacuum to make way for the IOL. Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Surgery (FLACS): This procedure combines advanced laser technology with phacoemulsification and is now a widely used technique. A device placed over the eye transmits detailed information to the femtosecond laser, enabling precise programming of the incision's location and depth. The laser creates the incision and softens the cataract, making it easier to remove during phacoemulsification. This method reduces the amount of energy required during the procedure, minimizes inflammation, and promotes faster recovery. Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS): This procedure involves removing the damaged lens through a small, tunnel-shaped incision in the eye. The self-sealing incision eliminates the need for sutures, lowering the risk of complications. However, it is rarely used in the United States. Extracapsular Surger: An older technique that is now seldom used, this procedure involves making an incision in the cornea with a scalpel to remove the lens. It is typically reserved for dense cataracts that cannot be treated with phacoemulsification. Complications As with any surgery, there is a possibility of complications, such as infection, bleeding, inflammation, double vision and high or low eye pressure. In rare instances, retinas can become detached. However, these problems are rare and can usually be treated with prompt medical attention. Occasionally, the eye tissue that encapsulates the IOL can cloud the new lens — a condition that is known as “posterior capsular opacification” or “secondary cataract,” which can develop months or even years after the surgery. It happens when a membrane called the posterior capsule—a sort of transparent pocket that holds your IOL in place—becomes cloudy. This normally can be corrected with a laser procedure. Can you prevent cataracts? While not everyone will develop cataracts, many do. That said, there are steps you can take to delay their onset, slow down the progression or even avoid the need for treatment. One of the most important: Protecting your eyes from the sun’s ultraviolet rays. “Long-term exposure to UV light does increase risks,” says Shahzad Mian, M.D., an eye surgeon at the Kellogg Eye Center at the University of Michigan. “People who live in equatorial climates get more advanced cataracts and at a younger age because of the more intense sunlight.” When you’re outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with UV400 or 100 percent UV protection to block harmful ultraviolet sunlight. Additional lifestyle changes include: If you smoke, stop; if you drink alcohol, do so in moderation; when sitting at the computer take screen breaks every 20 minutes; and focus on consuming a mostly plant-based diet, especially dark green veggies. A review of studies published in 2023 in the journal Nutrients shows that increased consumption of plant-based foods—vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts—as well as low-fat yogurt, coffee, and fish is particularly beneficial in reducing the prevalence of age-related cataracts. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. An example of phacoemulsification cataract surgery, a widely used procedure for treating cataracts.

There’s a laundry list of health complications that come from lofty glucose levels — among them, nerve damage in your hands and feet, kidney damage, heart disease and stroke. And then there are your eyes. What is diabetic retinopathy? People who have diabetes — Type 1 or Type 2 — are at risk for diabetic retinopathy, a condition where consistently high blood-sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that’s essential for maintaining vision. In fact, diabetic retinopathy is the leading common cause of vision loss among people with diabetes and the most frequent cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 20 to 74, a 2023 study found. What causes diabetic retinopathy? The onset of diabetic retinopathy largely depends on the type of diabetes a person has and how long they’ve had it. For example, people with type 1 diabetes are often diagnosed with diabetes at a younger age because their symptoms tend to be more severe. While they’re typically diagnosed early, it can still take years for diabetic retinopathy to develop. In contrast, type 2 diabetes — more common among older adults — can go undetected for years. Many people may not realize they have diabetes, especially if they haven’t seen a doctor in a while and feel fine. By the time they’re diagnosed, diabetic retinopathy may have already progressed to a more advanced stage. “If you get a new diagnosis of diabetes, especially type 2, it’s important to go to your eye doctor and get it checked,” says Lisa Olmos de Koo, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Stages and symptoms of diabetic retinopathy In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, you might not even know you have it. But as it worsens, your vision takes a hit. It may fluctuate between clear and blurry. You may get floaters (spots or dark strings in your vision), poor night vision, dark or empty areas in your vision, or colors that appear faded. Left unchecked, it can lead to permanent vision loss. The disease is categorized in two phases: Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) NPDR is the earliest stage and most common form of diabetic retinopathy. In this stage, tiny blood vessels in the retina are damaged, leading to a variety of issues. Blood spots, known as dot blot hemorrhages, and dilated blood vessels, called microaneurysms, are common signs. Additionally, cotton wool spots — areas with reduced blood flow—can develop, along with fatty deposits known as exudates. These changes can blur your vision, and sometimes lead to swelling of the retina (macular edema), where fluid accumulates in the center of the retina, worsening vision in a way that cannot be corrected with glasses. If untreated, chronic macular edema can result in irreversible damage to your sight. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) PDR is the most severe stage of diabetic retinopathy. Here, the damaged blood vessels in the retina have closed off, cutting off oxygen supply to the retina. In response, the body grows new blood vessels along the surface of the retina to try to restore nourishment. However, these new vessels are fragile and can easily burst with minor activities. When they bleed, they may fill the eye with blood, creating further complications and increasing the risk of retinal detachment as they pull on the retina. What’s more, scar tissue may form around these new blood vessels, which can contract and pull on the retina, potentially causing retinal detachment. “Sometimes you can have proliferative diabetic retinopathy and not even know it, says Olmos de Koo. “The central vision might be good, but you might have new blood vessels growing in the periphery or on the edges of the retina that haven't yet bled or tugged.” What does diabetic retinopathy look like in the eye? If you notice new eye floaters — tiny black specks or strands in your vision — it’s important to schedule a dilated eye exam, even if you don’t have diabetes. Only in very rare and severe cases can signs of diabetic retinopathy be visible by looking in the mirror. A dilated eye exam allows the doctor to thoroughly inspect the retina — the light-sensitive tissue lining the inner eyewall, which contains delicate blood vessels. During the exam, your eye doctor will check for signs of retinopathy, including blood spots, fatty deposits, swelling, or the growth of new, fragile blood vessels. Diabetic retinopathy maintenance and prevention Even if you don’t have diabetes, adults age 50 and older should check in with their primary care provider annually to rule out a diabetes diagnosis. “Sometimes, diabetes can creep up on you. You may feel fine and not be aware, causing damage in your eyes,” says Olmos de Koo. For those with diabetes, prevention starts with managing blood sugar levels. It's essential to work with your primary care provider or endocrinologist to discuss medications, lifestyle changes, and dietary adjustments that can help control blood sugar. “Even with the best ophthalmology treatments that we can provide, if the blood sugar remains high, a lot of times we’re not going to make a lot of leeway,” says Olmos de Koo. If you have mild or moderate NPDR, immediate treatment may not be necessary, but your ophthalmologist will monitor your eyes closely. Keeping your blood sugar in check can usually halt the progression and curb vision loss, and sometimes can even restore some of your vision. An ongoing study since 1984 has shown that maintaining lower A1c levels reduces the likelihood of developing vision-threatening retinopathy. It’s important that patients with Type 1 diabetes have annual screenings five years after the onset of their disease. Patients with Type 2 should have a prompt examination at the time of diagnosis, and at least a yearly examination, says Rahul Khurana, M.D., an associate clinical professor in ophthalmology at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center and President of the Northern California Retina Vitreous Associates. “Nearly 40 percent of Americans who have diabetes are not getting a dilated eye examination, and that’s a big problem,” Khurana adds. “We know that 95 percent of vision loss from diabetes can be prevented, but that can only happen if we examine patients early.” Monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels is crucial for protecting your vision. High blood pressure can exacerbate damage to the fragile blood vessels in the retina, while elevated cholesterol can lead to fatty deposits that further harm these delicate vessels. Together, these factors can accelerate the progression of diabetic retinopathy and worsen vision loss. “Imagine a garden hose that is weak and leaking,” explains Omesh P. Gupta, M.D., an ophthalmologist and retina specialist at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. “When your blood pressure is high, it’s like turning up the faucet, so the hose starts leaking even more severely.” Treatment options for diabetic retinopathy To halt or even reverse diabetic retinopathy, treatment options depend on the symptoms and underlying cause of vision loss. For diabetic macular edema (swelling of the retina that blurs vision in ways that glasses can’t correct), treatments typically involve eye injections using a small needle. There are two primary types of medications: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): This treatment makes blood vessels less leaky and can shrink new, abnormal blood vessels.Steroids: These help reduce swelling in the retina. Not only can we prevent patients from losing their vision, some patients can actually improve their vision,” says Khurana. Anti- VEGF injections are also used to prevent NPDR from progressing to more advanced stages. For new blood vessel growth, laser treatments called pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) are available. This involves making thousands of tiny laser burns to shrink the abnormal blood vessels and stabilize the retina, reducing the risk of vision loss. Typically, this treatment is done in one session at an ophthalmologist’s office or eye clinic, although some patients may require additional sessions. Blurry vision is expected for about a day after the procedure. In severe cases, such as retinal detachment or significant bleeding, retinal surgery (vitrectomy) may be necessary. This procedure clears out the blood. If there is a detachment, a bubble of silicone oil or gas can be used to hold the retina flat. Laser can be applied to any retinal tears and to perform PRP to shrink and stabilize new blood vessels. At the University of Washington, Olmos de Koo is collaborating with primary investigator Dr. Kasra Rezaei on a study investigating oral medication as a treatment option for diabetic retinopathy. The study focuses on fenofibrate, a drug traditionally used to lower fat in the bloodstream. Another imaging study at UW is exploring non-invasive methods to analyze blood flow in the eye without the need for injected dye — an important step since diabetic retinopathy is largely caused by inadequate blood flow to the retina.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/pelvic-floor-exercises/,"5 Quick Ways to Build Pelvic Muscles and Improve Your Sex Life Learn how to strengthen your pelvic floor without Kegel exercises Maskot/Getty Images By Cari Shane, AARP En español Published October 27, 2022 Little-known fact: Men have pelvic floors too. While this system of small, internal muscles at the base of the torso is often discussed in relation to pregnancy and childbirth, everyone has a pelvic floor. It supports the bowel, bladder and reproductive organs — and in your 50s, these muscles can grow lax, resulting in bladder leakage. On the plus side, toning your pelvic-floor muscles can fix that problem and also improve sexual function — and pleasure — in both sexes. The classic pelvic-floor exercises for moms are called Kegels; they involve rhythmically clenching the muscles that cut off your flow of urine. But for pelvic health in your 50s, these are “overrated,” according to Nora Arnold, a physical therapist and pelvic-floor therapist at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. Although a healthy pelvic floor needs to be strong, it additionally needs time “to relax,” Arnold says. If you overwork the muscles — for example, by habitually straining on the toilet — the pelvic floor can become too tight, which creates its own problems, says physical therapist and pelvic-floor specialist Erica Michitsch, co-owner of Solstice Physiotherapy in New York City. So, what to do? Any significant bladder, bowel or sexual problems merit a trip to your doctor. But for a healthy 50-something who just wants to try a little below-the-belt toning, Michitsch and Arnold recommend these pelvic-floor strengtheners. 1. Diaphragmatic breathing Sam Island The diaphragm, a thin parachute-shaped muscle under your lungs, “is hugely important for pelvic-floor health and function,” Arnold notes. To benefit both your pelvic floor and your nervous system, take “slow deep breaths in through your nose, letting the air gently expand your belly, inflating your whole trunk and abdomen like a balloon,” she advises. You should feel your abdominal wall relax and lengthen as you breathe in. Slowly breathe out, and repeat. 2. Plank and chaturanga Holding a yoga plank position — with your body and elbows straight ﻿— simultaneously engages your pelvic floor and your abdominal muscles, which strengthens your entire core, Michitsch says. Once you’re able to hold a plank for a minute or longer, try moving to a chaturanga pose, by bending your arms. Sam Island 3. ‘The Hundred’ Pilates move Sam Island To do this basic Pilates move, lie on your back on a mat or carpet, bend your knees toward your chest, and curl up your head, neck and shoulders. Then extend your legs in a 45-degree angle to the floor and vigorously pump your arms up and down, next to your body. Inhale through your nose for the first five pumps; exhale through your mouth for the next five. If you do 10 sets of 10, that’s one Hundred. 4. Air squat Sam Island This body weight-resistance move stretches your hamstrings and strengthens the pelvic floor by “pulling in your core and your pelvic floor,” Michitsch explains. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend your knees, keeping your back straight and your heels down. The goal is to get your hips below your knees. Be careful not to hold your breath. 5. Swimming laps Sam Island The pelvic floor is governed by the autonomic nervous system, which connects it to your fight-or-flight response. When you’re stressed, you can unconsciously clench down there, Arnold says. A great way to tone your core and pelvic floor while relieving stress is in the pool, where gravity exerts less pressure. Swimming combines core muscle work and breath work, and is a major stress buster.

Eating too much added sugar can increase your risk for numerous health problems By Jessica Migala, AARP Comments En español Published May 08, 2025 Chris Gash There’s some not-so-sweet news when it comes to sugar: Eat too much of the stuff and it can wreak havoc on your health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), consuming too many added sugars — which you’ll find in many packaged and processed foods and drinks — can lead to obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. But what about cancer? Here’s what researchers know so far about sugar and cancer risk. Older adults are overconsuming sugar First, it’s important to know how much sugar is too much. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends consuming no more than 10 percent of your daily calories from added sugars. If you’re eating 2,000 calories a day, that’s 200 calories, or 50 grams of added sugar. But many adults are not following this advice. 5 top sources of added sugars The top sources of added sugar, according to the CDC, include: Sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks) Desserts and sweet snacks Sweetened tea and coffee Candy Breakfast cereals and bars Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention According to a study published in 2023, nearly 30 percent of U.S. adults ages 51 to 70 were considered to be high consumers of added sugars, meaning they consumed 1.5 times the national recommendation. Twenty-two percent of people older than 70 were in this category. Note that added sugar is not the same as sugar that occurs naturally in fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains. “Sugar is in most of the food we eat,” says oncology dietitian Renee Stubbins, assistant professor of nutritional sciences in medicine at Houston Methodist. It provides energy that our cells need to survive. The difference is that foods that contain natural sugar, like strawberries and broccoli, also tend to have other essential nutrients, like fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. “These are cancer-fighting foods,” Stubbins says. Cookies and cupcakes, on the other hand, don’t come with any added nutritional benefits. 5 top sources of added sugars The top sources of added sugar, according to the CDC, include: Sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks) Desserts and sweet snacks Sweetened tea and coffee Candy Breakfast cereals and bars Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Does added sugar cause cancer? The answer isn’t completely straightforward. Natalie Ledesma, an oncology dietitian with UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Francisco, says we lack studies that identify sugar as a direct cause of cancer. “However, there are trials that show a higher consumption of added sugar is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers,” she says. For example, in a study analyzing the dietary records of more than 101,000 adults, consuming sugary drinks was associated with an 18 percent higher risk of overall cancer and a 22 percent higher risk for breast cancer. That research was published in the medical journal BMJ. And a review in Cancer Treatment and Research Communications concluded that high sugar intake may elevate cancer risk through insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, both of which can be drivers of cancer. Sugar can also lead to weight gain, and the CDC says being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk for 13 types of cancer. “We definitely know that metabolic dysfunction, which can be driven by having higher blood sugar levels and obesity, increases the risk for developing several different cancer types,” Ledesma says. In a PLOS One study, metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions including abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high sugar levels, high blood triglycerides and low “good” HDL cholesterol — was associated with an increased risk of 11 cancers, including: ColorectalLiverPancreaticPostmenopausal breastEndometrialBladderKidneyNon-Hodgkin’s lymphomaLeukemiaLungThyroid Researchers point to inflammation as one possible explanation. Having more adiposity — or body fat, especially abdominal fat — creates more of an inflammatory state, explains Stubbins, and chronic inflammation can contribute to the development of cancer. Keep in mind that you can have metabolic dysfunction even if you’re at a healthy weight. “Some people can eat whatever they want and never gain a pound, but that doesn’t mean that they’re healthy,” says Kim Geiringer, an oncology dietitian at the Maroone Cancer Center at Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital in Weston, Florida. “They can have high levels of fat cells in their body, or high cholesterol or triglycerides. They may even have prediabetes or [be] eking towards it, which also puts you at a higher risk of cancer.” This means that no matter your weight, it’s important to know your metabolic health numbers (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar) and consume a balanced diet, which includes moderating your sugar intake. What if you already have cancer? The idea that sugar “feeds” existing cancer cells is a common refrain, giving way to the notion that you can starve cancer cells if you don’t give them sugar. But there’s a lot of nuance to this, Geiringer says. As the fuel for every cell in our body, glucose (sugar) does feed cancer cells. But our bodies run on glucose, and “unfortunately, you can’t give glucose to healthy cells and not cancer cells,” Geiringer says. “You can’t starve cancer. In fact, when you have cancer, you have increased nutritional needs. You need more calories and protein, so cutting out any food can lead to weight loss and malnutrition, which leads to poor outcomes in cancer,” Geiringer says. One reason: The body requires more nutrients to heal, cope with side effects and keep up energy after what can be very taxing treatments. In this instance, a dietitian may recommend drinking a milkshake, if that’s what you can stomach, because the sugar risk pales in comparison with the risk of not meeting your calorie needs. Of course, this is based on you as an individual, but it also helps to know that sugar intake was not found to be associated with cancer mortality, according to research published in Nutrition. Striking the right balance with sugar All this is not to say you can’t indulge in sweets that can spark a smile or turn a get-together into a celebration. But there has to be a balance, Stubbins says. “It’s important to have functional sugar — found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables — most of the time and occasionally eat the treats,” she adds. For cancer prevention and overall health, the World Cancer Research Fund says that 40 percent of cancers can be prevented with healthy lifestyle habits. While cutting back on added sugar is one step, it’s not the only one. A cancer-preventive lifestyle includes limiting alcohol, exercising, limiting fast foods, and eating more whole grains, vegetables, fruit and beans. What about artificial sweeteners? Some people turn to artificial sugars to get that sweet taste without calories, but there has been concern that they can cause cancer, too. However, according to groups like the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, nonnutritive sweeteners, or sugar substitutes, have not been found to cause cancer in the amounts we typically consume, though research is ongoing. Still, these are often found in ultra-processed foods, which registered dietitians generally advise limiting as well. Still, there is only so much that’s under your control when it comes to your future health. “Having a healthier diet means there is less of a chance to develop cancer cells,” Geiringer says. “But unfortunately, if you have a genetic predisposition to cancer, diet can help but it may not be completely preventative.” What about artificial sweeteners? Some people turn to artificial sugars to get that sweet taste without calories, but there has been concern that they can cause cancer, too.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/poop-and-health/,"What Your Poop Can Tell You About Your Health The #1 reason to pay attention to your #2? It offers clues to potentially serious conditions By Rachel Nania, Updated March 01, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published September 13, 2021 / Updated March 01, 2024 Getty Images The topic may be taboo for cocktail conversation —﻿ and it’s definitely not discussed at the dinner table — but ﻿fecal matter, when it comes to health, is an important matter. ﻿ That’s because what comes out of your body can tell you a lot about what’s going on inside of it. Changes in your stool can reflect changes in your diet, mood and physical activity; some shifts can even signal more serious conditions. Before you start obsessing over your bowel movements, know that “everybody’s stool varies some from time to time,” depending on what you eat, how much you move and the medicines that you’re taking, among other things, says William Chey, M.D., professor of gastroenterology and nutrition sciences at Michigan Medicine﻿ at the University of Michigan. So best “not to overinterpret” it. What is Poop? It may be hard to picture, but poop is the remaining part of the food that you ate — the bits that your body didn’t want. After the small intestine absorbs all the nutrients the body wants and needs from your food, it passes what’s left (the digestive waste) to the large intestines, where it changes from a liquid to stool and starts making its way out of your body. Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases On the other hand, “it’s also really easy to ignore things and not worry when you do need to,” Chey adds. The key is to know your normal. Some people poop a few times a day; others go a few times a week. When you want to start paying attention is “if you have an abrupt change in your bowel habits and it lasts more than a day﻿.” Here are a few things to be on the lookout for. Red, maroon or black poop One of the more concerning changes is blood in the stool, which can appear red, maroon or even black. Bright﻿-red blood often indicates that the bleeding is coming from the lower end of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract — “and it’s almost always from hemorrhoids,” Chey says. A little bright﻿-red blood can also be ﻿due to a small tissue tear inside the tush. Darker blood that shows up almost black suggests bleeding higher up in the GI tract, such as in the stomach or the small intestine. If you notice this, it’s important to consult your doctor. “One concerning explanation would be a tumor or a large polyp that has gotten big enough that it’s developed a blood supply that has begun to bleed intermittently,” says Nitin Ahuja, M.D., a gastroenterologist and associate professor﻿ of clinical medicine at the Perelman ﻿Center for Advanced Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Ulcers can also bleed ﻿anywhere in the GI tract, he notes. But know, too, that there are other, less distressing reasons that your waste may appear red or black. “Someone who takes a new affinity for beets, for example﻿ — ﻿﻿that would be a competing explanation for consistent change in color toward red,” Ahuja says. And taking iron supplements or bismuth subsalicylate (better known by its brand name﻿ Pepto-Bismol) can turn your stool black — so can black licorice or a meal of squid-ink pasta. What is Poop? It may be hard to picture, but poop is the remaining part of the food that you ate — the bits that your body didn’t want. After the small intestine absorbs all the nutrients the body wants and needs from your food, it passes what’s left (the digestive waste) to the large intestines, where it changes from a liquid to stool and starts making its way out of your body. Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Pale poop If your poop appears pale and even seems to float in the toilet, it may be an indication that your pancreas, an organ that aids in digestion, isn’t working normally, Chey says. ﻿Very smelly poop that looks greasy or oily can also point to problems with the pancreas, according to ﻿the Mayo Clinic, and may mean that your body is having trouble digesting fat. A problem with the liver could be another reason for pale poop, since the organ is responsible for releasing the bile that typically gives feces its brown hue. Be sure to talk ﻿with a doctor if either of these issues — pale or greasy stool — persist﻿s for more than a few days, especially if you’re experiencing weight loss or abdominal pain alongside it. The Bristol Stool Scale Getty Images How often are you going? Consistency is another important feature to pay attention to — and﻿, along with it, frequency. If you’re someone ﻿who ﻿releases soft stools every day, for example, and then you’re suddenly not able to go — or can produce ﻿only pencil-thin ﻿feces﻿ — it could point to an obstruction, like a mass or lesion, somewhere in your GI tract, says Reezwana Chowdhury, M.D., a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Trouble going can also be diet﻿ related. Increasing your water and fiber intake — try more fruits, vegetables and whole grains — can help with constipation. So can exercise. “I tell many of my patients who have issues with constipation: The more you move, the more your gut moves,” Chowdhury says. “A sedentary lifestyle does slow your gut down.” Constipation also becomes more common with age. “Things just slow down” as we get older, Chey ﻿explains. Often, people are less active, their diets change﻿ and they’re taking more medications. Add all ﻿those factors together and you have a greater likelihood of experiencing constipation. The Bristol Stool Scale Getty Images If your issues lie on the opposite side of the spectrum and your bowel movements are frequent and watery (diarrhea), it may be ﻿due to something you ate or a sign that your body is fighting a virus or struggling with a food intolerance. Diarrhea is common and usually goes away on its own, according to Ahuja. But if it lasts more than a few days, it could signal a more serious problem. Another thing to be on the lookout for: ﻿having loose stools and frequent trips to the bathroom at night. “We always tell people that if they’re having diarrhea at night, they need to see their doctor, because that indicates that there’s some underlying disease, like inflammatory bowel disease, or microscopic colitis or celiac disease. There’s something else going on,” Chey says. Stay on top of screenings Any sudden changes in your bowel behaviors that last more than a day or two warrant a call to your doctor, who may order a colonoscopy “just to make sure that there’s no inflammation or evidence of cancer or something else that might have led to that abrupt change in your bowel habits,” Chey says. Adults 45 and older should get regular colorectal cancer screenings, according to the American Cancer Society. One option is a colonoscopy every 10 years; an alternative is a stool-based test, which is ﻿taken every ﻿one to three years. People at higher risk for colon cancer may need to be screened earlier and more often. “The parting line is going to be﻿, ﻿when in doubt, talk to a physician. We’re always happy to talk about what’s worrisome and what’s not,” Ahuja says. Constipated? Try These Foods Sixty-three million Americans deal with chronic constipation.

Two surgeons — Joseph Serletti, M.D., chief of plastic surgery at Penn Medicine, and Nicholas Mahoney, M.D., of the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Medicine — helped us consider the full range of options. Violet Frances/Bryan Christie Design; Getty Images 1. Upper-Lid Blepharoplasty 2. Ptosis Repair 1. Upper-lid blepharoplasty What is it? Surgery to remove loose, excess skin on the eyelid. Also called an eyelid lift. Pros Noticeable, lasting results. Cons Initial recovery takes 10 to 14 days. Can worsen dry-eye symptoms. Often not covered by insurance. Price From $2,000 for outpatient surgery to $10,000 for a hospital procedure, depending on the complexity of your case. 2. Ptosis repair What is it? Surgery to tighten a muscle in the upper eyelid. Pros Offers lasting results. Insurance may cover this procedure if drooping eyelids have affected your vision. Cons Requires 10 days of postsurgery rest. Procedure doesn’t resolve excess skin. There’s a chance of irritation, dryness and eye asymmetry. Price From $3,000 to $7,000, depending on the complexity of treatment and whether both eyelids are involved. 3. Nonsurgical Eyelid Lift, 4. Prescription eye drops Violet Frances/Bryan Christie Design; Getty Images 3. Nonsurgical eyelid lift What is it? Botox or dermal fillers are injected mostly around your eyebrows, slightly lifting them and thereby your lids. Pros Takes 10 to 20 minutes, with no recovery time. Fillers can be dissolved if you’re unhappy with them. Cons Not a permanent solution. Botox lasts three to six months; fillers last 12 to 18 months. Price Botox: $400 to $800 per treatment; fillers: $800 to $1,100 per treatment. 4. Prescription eye drops What is it? An FDA-approved medication called Upneeq temporarily lifts droopy lids caused by ptosis (a weakened eyelid muscle). Pros Easy, once-a-day application.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/strep-throat-or-sore-throat/,"Is It a Sore Throat or Strep Throat? How to Tell the Difference Even if you don’t have strep, there are﻿ reasons to see a doctor By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published February 15, 2024 Getty Images/AARP A single swallow feels as though a thousand tiny daggers are stabbing the inside of your neck. No doubt you have a sore throat. But is it strep? While the most common cause of a sore throat is a virus — including the viruses that cause the common cold and flu — other triggers, including allergies, postnasal drip and environmental irritants can cause the throat to be sore. So can a bacteria group known as A Streptococcus, or﻿ group A strep, which is to blame for strep throat, a highly contagious illness that is most common in the winter and spring seasons. What are the symptoms of strep throat? “There isn't any single symptom that you hang your hat on to rule in or rule out strep,” says John Mafi, M.D., a primary care physician and associate professor of medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research at University of California, Los Angeles. Rather, it’s a combination of symptoms that can help you spot strep throat; but just know that a simple swab of the throat at the doctor’s office is the only way to confirm it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who have strep also tend to experience: FeverRed and swollen tonsilsWhite patches or streaks of pus on the tonsilsA sore throat that started quickly and may appear red Also common with strep throat is tender and swollen lymph nodes, says Viviana S. Martinez-Bianchi, M.D., a family medicine physician at Duke Health. And some people, especially kids and teenagers, will get “a little rash that is red and feels like sandpaper﻿,” she says. When strep throat is accompanied by a rash, which often starts on the neck, underarm and groin before spreading over the body, it's referred to as scarlet fever. Sometimes people with strep can get a headache or experience nausea or vomiting. On the other hand, a cough, runny nose, pink eye and a raspy or hoarse voice are all signs that your sore throat stems from a viral infection and is not strep, the CDC says. “When we start seeing all of those other symptoms, we're thinking it's more likely to be a virus than bacteria,” Martinez-Bianchi says. Can older adults get strep? While strep is often associated with school-age children, adults are not immune to the painful and contagious illness. About 1 in 10 adults with a sore throat has strep throat, the CDC says. “A lot of people think, ‘Oh, I'm an older adult; I don’t have it, I had it as a kid.’ But it's not one of those things that if you had it once you're not going to get it again,” Martinez-Bianchi says. So if you were around someone with strep throat and go on to develop symptoms, get tested for it. Strep spreads very easily and in the same way that many illnesses do: through respiratory droplets — from coughs and sneezes, for example — and direct contact with an infected person. Because strep is caused by a bacterial infection, it’s treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, the infection can lead to complications, including kidney inflammation, a bloodstream infection and rheumatic fever, a serious condition that can damage the heart. Mafi says while older adults aren’t necessarily more susceptible to serious illness from strep throat, it’s important to remember that “the older you are, the more likely that any infection can lead to complications.” When to see a doctor If you think you have strep, you should see a doctor to get tested and treated. Results from a rapid test are available in minutes. However, even if you think your sore throat is not due to strep, there are instances that warrant a doctor’s visit. For example, the viruses that cause COVID-19 and flu can cause a sore throat, so if you suspect you have one of these illnesses, call your health care provider. There are prescription antiviral treatments for both flu and COVID-19, and these medicines can reduce the risk of serious symptoms that can be especially dangerous for older adults and that can lead to other complications like pneumonia. The take-home message, Mafi says, is “if you're older, you have chronic comorbidities, you're vulnerable for different reasons, then you should be more vigilant.” Another warning sign that you need medical attention is if you’re having so much pain and trouble swallowing that you’re drooling; this could be a sign of an abscess, Martinez-Bianchi says. Worsening symptoms, a high fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain and blood in the saliva or mucus are other signs that you should see a doctor. Relieving sore throat symptoms If it’s a virus causing your sore throat, antibiotics won’t help﻿ and can﻿, in fact, cause additional health issues,﻿ including diarrhea or rash, Mafi says. But several other remedies may bring relief, the CDC says, including: Ice chips, popsicles, or lozengesGargling with salt waterDrinking plenty of fluidsOver-the-counter pain relievers, though you should always check with your doctor first to discuss any side effects or potential drug interactions.Rest. “You really need to take at least a day or two to really let your body rest and recover,” Mafi says. And don’t forget about honey. A large review of studies published in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine found that honey is more effective than over-the-counter medications for cough and cold symptoms, including sore throat. “So I actually advise my patients to take honey,” Mafi says, though it’s not recommended for people who are immunosuppressed or for infants. “But, in general, it's very safe and it is effective.” Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments."
https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/older-adults-high-dose-flu-shot/,"Your Guide to the 2023-2024 Flu Season View Series Older Adults Should Opt for High-Dose Flu Shots 65 or over? The CDC has influenza vaccine recommendations just for you By Rachel Nania, Updated September 08, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published July 01, 2022 / Updated September 08, 2023 Getty Images ﻿A reminder just ahead of flu season: ﻿When you roll up your sleeve for the shot this year, skip the standard version and opt for one with more oomph. Since the summer of 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that adults 65 years and older get immunized with what’s known as a high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine. These shots can offer greater protection to older people, who, due to immune system changes that happen with age, do not have as strong a response to vaccination as younger, healthier people. Older adults are more susceptible to complications from the flu. In fact, it’s estimated that between 70 and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths and 50 to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur in people 65 and older. “Given their increased risk of flu-associated severe illness, hospitalization and death, it’s important to use these potentially more effective vaccines in people 65 years and older,” José R. Romero, M.D., director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a July 2022 statement when the recommendation was first made. The three available vaccines The more powerful flu shots have been available for several years. However, ﻿previous recommendations did not explicitly favor them over the standard flu vaccines, which help keep an influenza infection from progressing to a serious illness. “It was more of a soft recommendation,” says William Schaffner, M.D., a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.﻿ But data collected from studies over the years now shows that there’s “better protection for people ages 65 and older with one of these enhanced vaccines,” Schaffner says. “So basically, the signal has gone out to all the providers that [they need] to make an effort to stock these vaccines going forward for people aged 65 and older.” The CDC’s recommendation didn’t come with a preference for any one of the three enhanced vaccines on the market. Schaffner’s advice is to get the one that’s available. “Don’t be too picky,” he says. “They’re all really enhanced vaccines.” Just make sure you’re asking for one of the versions that is specifically recommended for older adults. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, an inactivated vaccine (meaning it uses the killed version of the germ that causes a disease) approved for people 65-plus, contains four times the antigen of standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines. Antigen is the part of the vaccine that helps your body build up protection against flu viruses, the CDC explains. Fluad Quadrivalent, also an inactivated vaccine approved for people 65 and older, has the same amount of antigen as the standard shots but contains an adjuvant, or an ingredient added to a vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response to vaccination. Flublok Quadrivalent, approved for people 18 and older, is made using a different vaccine technology (it’s a recombinant protein vaccine). The high-dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines may result in more of the mild, temporary side effects that can occur with standard-dose seasonal flu shots, the CDC says. Expected side effects can include pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, headache, muscle ache and fatigue. These symptoms typically resolve within one to three days. Before the CDC’s recommendation, ﻿about 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries were already receiving a higher-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine, federal data shows. However, the CDC notes that racial and ethnic disparities existed. One study published in The Lancet Healthy Longevity found that minority groups were 26 to 32 percent less likely than whites to receive a high-dose flu vaccine. The CDC’s 2022 recommendation “could help reduce health disparities by making these vaccines more available to racial and ethnic minority groups,” Romero says. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated each year against the flu. If you’re 65 or older and one of the enhanced vaccines is not available when you go to get your flu shot, get a standard-dose flu vaccine instead, the agency says. “When you’re 65 and older and you’re talking about influenza, you need all the help that you can get,” Schaffner says. “So I have a very strong message to absolutely everyone 65 and older: Better to be vaccinated than not.” ﻿﻿ Editor’s note: This article, originally published July 1, 2022, has been updated to reflect new information.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/fda-approves-novavax-vaccine/,"Third COVID Vaccine Gets Approved for Adults 65 and Over Novavax shot also cleared for people ages 12 to 64 with underlying health conditions By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published May 19, 2025 AARP (Sipa via AP Images, Getty Images) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially approved a COVID-19 vaccine from Novavax for adults 65 and older and for individuals ages 12 to 64﻿ who have an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk for serious illness from a coronavirus infection. The vaccine, Nuvaxovid, is the third coronavirus shot to gain full approval, joining vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. It has been available under emergency use authorization for people 12 and older since 2022. Unlike the other two FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines, however, Nuvaxovid’s approval is limited to older adults and some people at higher risk for severe illness. Both Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines are approved for people 12 and older and are available under emergency use authorization for kids as young as 6 months old. Find COVID-19 vaccines in your state AARP's 53 state and territory COVID-19 vaccine guides can help you find vaccines near you and provide the latest answers to common questions about costs, eligibility and availability. “Market research and U.S. CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] statistics indicate that older individuals and those with underlying conditions are the populations most likely to seek out COVID-19 vaccination seasonally,” Novavax President and Chief Executive Officer John C. Jacobs said in a statement. “This significant milestone demonstrates our commitment to these populations and is a significant step towards availability of our protein-based vaccine option."" According to federal data, older adults represent 94 percent of all COVID-19 deaths. And while hospitalizations are lower now than they were during peak periods, the hospitalization rate for adults 65 and older towers over the rates for younger populations. How Nuvaxovid differs from mRNA vaccines Novavax’s vaccine is based on a more traditional platform than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are. It’s a protein subunit vaccine, meaning it contains harmless copies of the COVID-19 spike protein and trains the immune system to recognize and attack this protein. Doctors have seen it as an alternative for people who remain skeptical about the mRNA vaccines or who may be allergic to them. The FDA approval did not specify what health conditions make someone age 12 to 64 eligible for Nuvaxovid. But according to the CDC, more than 20 categories of conditions, such as chronic lung disease, cancer and heart issues, can increase a person’s risk for severe illness from a coronavirus infection. ﻿ The FDA is requiring Novavax to conduct post-marketing trials to continue studying the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness. Novavax says it expects to be ready for the commercial delivery of the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine formula in the U.S. this fall, pending vaccine strain recommendations from FDA advisers. A meeting to discuss updates to the COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for May 22. A group of vaccine experts that advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations is scheduled to meet in late June.

We don't guarantee the accuracy of the tool and recommend consulting your doctor or health care provider regarding your particular situation. Your body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of your body fat that is based on your height and weight. Some doctors use BMI, along with other health indicators, to assess an person’s current health status and potential health risks. People with higher BMIs are more likely to develop chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and heart disease. To determine your own BMI, use this calculator. BMI calculator results are grouped into the broad categories: underweight, healthy weight, overweight and obesity. As you review your results, keep in mind that BMI has limitations, and should not be used to assess a child’s weight because the appropriate weight for children varies significantly by age. Learn more about how age and race might affect BMI results in our FAQ, below. If you have questions or concerns about your BMI results, talk to your doctor or health care provider. It’s important to know that many factors besides BMI — including family history, eating habits and activity levels — also affect your overall health.

BMI, or body mass index, is a screening tool that takes into account a person’s height and weight. It slots people into four weight groups (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obesity) that may be linked to health problems. But BMI doesn’t directly measure a person’s health. The BMI should be used along with other measures, including your level of physical activity, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, to assess your risks for disease. What is a healthy BMI? The healthy weight category is defined as a BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9. A weight in this category is linked to fewer health problems than the underweight, overweight and obesity categories. What should my BMI be? The healthy weight category — defined as a BMI of between 18.5 to 24.9 — is considered ideal. But keep in mind that BMI is not a perfect measure. For example, it does not take into account how much fat you carry or where the fat is distributed, factors that can affect your metabolic health. How is BMI calculated? Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. How accurate is BMI? That depends. BMI can’t tell how much of your weight is from fat or muscle, so it misses information important to assessing your health risks. For instance, athletes can have a high BMI because of their muscle mass, even if they’re not overweight. Also, the definitions for the weight categories are based primarily on white populations, so it may be less accurate for people of other races and ethnicities. How can age or race affect BMI? BMI doesn’t differentiate between fat, bone and muscle; therefore, it may be less accurate for older people, who tend to lose muscle mass and bone density as they age. (That’s why people over 65 may benefit from a slightly higher BMI, between 25 and 27.) Research shows that the BMI definition of obesity overestimates risk in Black people and underestimates it in individuals of Asian descent, which may lead to inappropriate treatment and health disparities.

But the secret to staying strong and vital for life isn’t just in walking, running, biking, swimming and other forms of aerobic fitness. It’s in your muscles. In a 2021 review of 16 studies from around the globe, researchers found that just 30 to 60 minutes a week of muscle-strengthening, or “resistance,” exercise increased life expectancy by 10 to 17 percent. What counts as muscle-strengthening exercise? Lifting weights, of course, but also yoga, Pilates, calisthenics and even carrying the groceries (or a grandchild).

Step by step, we'll: Show you the secrets to losing weight Give you guides to healthy foods Provide dozens of delicious new recipes to try Help you embrace a whole new way of eating Get Started Eating protein in the proper amounts, at the proper time, is also crucial for preserving muscle. As we outline in AARP’s New York Times best-selling book, The Whole Body Reset, science shows that women 50 and older need at least 25 grams of protein at every meal (30 grams for men) to stimulate protein synthesis, the process for building and maintaining muscle. Studies show that when people in their 60s combined this style of eating, known as “protein timing,” with resistance exercise, their bodies respond as if they were in their 20s. Here’s why combining resistance exercise and protein timing is so important for your health. 1. You’ll keep your brain healthy One study looked at 970 people living in senior communities who had no evidence of cognitive decline. Researchers put the subjects through a series of strength tests, measuring their upper and lower extremities. Over the next 3.6 years, 15 percent of the subjects developed Alzheimer’s disease. But their risk was strongly determined by where they fell on the strength scale: For every 1 point increase in muscle strength, a subject’s risk of Alzheimer’s dropped by 43 percent. 2. You’ll reduce your risk of future ​weight gain A low level of muscular fitness was associated with higher odds of gaining at least 22 pounds over the ensuing 20 years, one study found. 3. You’ll keep your blood pressure ​under control In another study, higher levels of muscular strength were associated with a reduced risk of developing high blood pressure among men with prehypertension.

You’ll slash your risk of heart disease Several studies have shown that the greater your muscular strength, the lower your chance of developing metabolic syndrome — a constellation of health issues including excess abdominal fat, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol, all of which are tied to heart disease. And the greater your muscular strength, the lower your levels of inflammatory compounds, which may also help to lower your risk of heart disease. 5. You’ll beat back diabetes Higher muscle mass has been associated with better insulin sensitivity and lower risk of developing diabetes or prediabetes; in a study of 13,644 subjects, those with the lowest percentage of muscle were 63 percent more likely to have diabetes than those with the highest percentage.

And in a study of men who had undergone a radical prostatectomy to treat prostate cancer, those with the lowest levels of muscle were more likely to see a recurrence of the cancer and more likely to die of the disease. 7.

https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/superfoods-to-fight-flu/,"8 Foods That Can Help Fight Off the Flu What you should be eating and drinking to build a stronger defense this winter By Hallie Levine, Updated February 17, 2025 AARP Comments En español Published November 01, 2021 / Updated February 17, 2025 Getty Images The saying “you are what you eat” applies to your entire body, but it’s especially important when it comes to your immune system during flu season. “As we get older, our immunity starts to decline, but if we get the right nutrients, we can help our immune systems do their jobs to protect us against viruses like the flu,” says Samantha Heller, a clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health. You can keep it in tip-top shape this flu season — which is turning out to be one of the worst in years — if you focus on a plant-based diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods, ﻿Heller says. ﻿ Here are eight foods that nutritionists recommend for flu season. 1. Green tea Whether these particular tea leaves can really fend off the flu has been a source of debate among health researchers for years. But a meta-analysis published in July of 2021 in the journal Molecules looked at more than eight studies involving more than 5,000 participants to conclude there really is ample evidence to believe the beverage — and specifically, the catechins that provide its antioxidant power — can help your immune system fend off influenza. 2. Sweet potatoes﻿ They’re a great source of beta-carotene, a phytonutrient that helps your body make vitamin A. “It supports respiratory health by increasing the number of immune cells in the body,” explains Anna Taylor, lead outpatient clinical dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. This is especially important for older adults, she adds, as our bodies make fewer immune cells as we age. ﻿ Instead of cooking sweet potatoes with butter or brown sugar, Taylor recommends roasting them with olive oil, oregano and black pepper. “You’ll get additional benefits from the spices, but you’re not loading up on sugar and saturated fat﻿, both of which suppress your immune system,” she says. 3. Berries They’re a rich source of vitamin C, which stimulates production of infection﻿-fighting white blood cells, Taylor says. A 2018 review of studies found that berries increased levels of disease﻿-fighting cells in older adults, such as natural killer cells and T-cells. They also contain flavonoids, substances that have antioxidant properties and protect all your cells﻿ —﻿ including your immune system cells﻿ —﻿ from damage, Taylor adds. ﻿ It’s easy to incorporate berries into your diet: ﻿“﻿Add them to your morning yogurt or oatmeal, or even cook them and throw them on your French toast instead of maple syrup,” Taylor recommends. 4. Beans Why ﻿Fluids ﻿Matter if You ﻿Get the ﻿Flu Whether water, electrolyte-rich beverages, broths or green tea (see above), you really do need liquids if you’re sick with the flu. Not only is it important to fend off dehydration, staying hydrated helps you maintain enough circulating blood volume to treat infection. (Just go easy on the caffeinated sodas and coffee.) And yes, doctors say chicken soup can’t hurt, since fever can cause you to lose water as well as salt. Chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans﻿ — ﻿they’re all rich in vitamin B12, a nutrient many older adults are low in, Heller says. “People over the age of 50 don’t absorb vitamin B12 as well in their body, but your immune system needs it to fight disease and repair damaged cells to keep you healthy,” Heller explains. ﻿ Beans are also high in zinc, which helps boost your body’s production of white blood cells, Taylor says. “Zinc deficiency has been linked to immune system dysfunction,” she says. Taylor recommends at least a half a cup of cooked beans three times a week﻿. ﻿You can throw them into soups, salads or even rice dishes﻿. ﻿For a healthy crunchy snack, roast chickpeas in some olive oil. 5. Nuts and seeds These foods are rich in vitamin E, which plays a key role in your immune system by supporting the growth of germ-fighting T-cells, says Lauri Wright, ﻿director of nutrition programs at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. They’re also a good source of omega-6 fatty acids. Walnuts are an especially good choice, as research shows they have a very positive effect on your gut microbiome, says clinical nutritionist Kate Cohen. They also have more alpha-linolenic acid﻿ — an essential fatty acid important for immune function﻿ — than any other type of nut. 6. Salmon Why ﻿Fluids ﻿Matter if You ﻿Get the ﻿Flu Whether water, electrolyte-rich beverages, broths or green tea (see above), you really do need liquids if you’re sick with the flu. Not only is it important to fend off dehydration, staying hydrated helps you maintain enough circulating blood volume to treat infection. (Just go easy on the caffeinated sodas and coffee.) And yes, doctors say chicken soup can’t hurt, since fever can cause you to lose water as well as salt. It’s ﻿not plant﻿-based, but it is one of the few foods that provides vitamin D, which plays a huge role in regulating your immune system, says Jennifer McDaniel, owner of McDaniel Nutrition Therapy in Clayton, Missouri. A 2020 study published in the journal JAMA Network Open found that people who had untreated vitamin D deficiency were almost twice as likely to test positive for COVID-19 ﻿as patients who had sufficient levels of the vitamin. A 6-ounce salmon filet has about 600 international units (IU﻿) of vitamin D, which is close to the 800 IU that﻿ is recommended daily for people 70 and older. Another bonus: ﻿It’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have also been shown to strengthen your immune system. If you’re not a fan of fish, McDaniel suggests marinating it in brown sugar and Dijon mustard for 45 minutes, then throwing it on the grill. “It mellows out that fishy taste, and it gives it a smoky flavor,” she explains. Canned salmon counts, too: ﻿Throw it over a salad for a quick meal, she says. ﻿ 7. Garlic It’s rich in a compound called alliin, which may be the source of its immune﻿-boosting properties, notes Libby Mills, a Philadelphia-based nutritionist. A 2020 review published in the journal Medical Hypotheses found that garlic itself seems to stimulate cells related to immune system function. Another study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that people given about 2½ grams of aged garlic extract for 90 days not only had higher levels of immune system cells, but they also had fewer symptoms of cold and flu, and missed fewer workdays due to these respiratory illnesses, than a control group. At the very least, if you eat enough of it, you’ll probably keep people away from you, Mills jokes. Although there’s probably not enough research to support taking a garlic supplement, Mills recommends that you cook with it in the colder winter months. You can make your own pasta sauce with tomatoes and garlic, since vitamin C (found in tomatoes) is itself an antioxidant that helps the immune system she says. 8. Kefir Research, including a 2021 study published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, suggests that certain compounds found in fermented dairy such as kefir (which is like a thin yogurt) have anti-inflammatory properties that can help the immune system fight viral infections. The probiotics found in kefir and other fermented foods also help to calm chronic inflammation, according to Harvard Health. “Fermented dairy is rich in probiotics, which seem to have a positive effect on the immune system,” Mills explains.

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/bronchitis-vs-pneumonia,"Bronchitis vs. Pneumonia: How to Tell Symptoms Apart These two diseases can look and feel the same, but they pose different risks By Rachel Nania, Updated December 02, 2024 AARP Comments En español Published February 01, 2024 / Updated December 02, 2024 Getty Images / AARP If it seems like more people are coughing these days, you’re not wrong. Cold and flu season is picking up, according recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And in some areas of the U.S., a few common respiratory illnesses that can cause you to whoop and hack — such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — are increasing in activity. Not only can flu, RSV, COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses make you feel miserable, but they can also lead to secondary issues, including bronchitis and pneumonia. If you’ve had a cough that you just can’t shake, you may be wondering if one of these conditions is to blame. Both share some similar symptoms, but they can require different treatments — and they pose different risks. Here’s how to tell if you have bronchitis vs. pneumonia, plus the questions you should — and shouldn’t — be asking your doctor. What is ﻿bronchitis? Acute vs. chronic bronchitis Acute bronchitis is what’s commonly called a chest cold. According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms usually improve within a week to 10 days, though the cough can persist for weeks. Chronic bronchitis is long-term inflammation of the airways and is one of the more common lung diseases that contribute to COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Bronchitis — or what’s officially called acute bronchitis — often starts out as a cold or flu-like illness. You might experience congestion or feel run-down and achy, says Neil Kalsi, M.D., an assistant professor in the University of Nebraska Medical Center ﻿Department of ﻿Family ﻿Medicine. But with bronchitis, the infection — which is almost always caused by a virus — evolves and the airways leading to the lungs get inflamed and filled with mucus. The result is a nagging cough that can persist for several weeks﻿. “It’s that cough that doesn’t go away. It’s the cough that comes up when you’re trying to laugh or talk to someone on the phone,” says Kalsi, who adds that the cough can either be dry or come with some mucus and possibly even wheezing. “But it’s a really, really annoying cough that makes it hard for people to go to work because they just can’t talk to people.” Other symptoms of bronchitis can include: Soreness in the chestFatigueBody achesSore throat How is it treated? Because bronchitis is usually caused by a virus — typically the same viruses that cause colds and the flu — antibiotics rarely help and﻿, in fact, could cause more health issues. Instead, the common prescription for recovery is plenty of rest, fluids — and even some honey. Multiple clinical trials have found that honey can help to improve the symptoms of a cough and does a better job than over-the-counter cough medicines. A summary of the research was published in 2020 in the journal BMJ Evidence﻿-Based Medicine. “If you’re going to spend the 10 bucks on a cough medicine, might as well buy some local honey instead,” Kalsi says. Just know that with bronchitis, recovery can take time, especially when it comes to getting rid of the cough. “It’s not going to be a day-by-day improvement; it’s going to be a week-by-week improvement,” Kalsi says. Acute vs. chronic bronchitis Acute bronchitis is what’s commonly called a chest cold. According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms usually improve within a week to 10 days, though the cough can persist for weeks. Chronic bronchitis is long-term inflammation of the airways and is one of the more common lung diseases that contribute to COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). What is pneumonia? While bronchitis affects the larger airways, pneumonia develops in the air sacs of the lungs. Like bronchitis, it also causes inflammation and fluid buildup. Viruses, bacteria and fungi can all cause pneumonia. In the U.S., some of the more common causes of viral pneumonia include influenza, RSV﻿, COVID-19 and rhinovirus (the predominant cause of the common cold), according to the CDC. When it comes to bacteria, pneumococcus, which causes pneumococcal disease, is often to blame. The bug can be which can be spread by coughing, sneezing or touching infected surfaces. Like bronchitis, pneumonia can trigger a bad cough that may come with mucus. But other symptoms of pneumonia tend to be more serious and can include: Fever, shaking and chillsShortness of breathRapid, shallow breathingChest painLoss of appetiteFatigueConfusion, especially in older adults With pneumonia, “you can feel much more run-down, fatigued﻿, short of breath,” Kalsi says. “It can be much more intense.” According to the American Lung Association, pneumonia causes more than 1 million hospitalizations and more than 50,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Chest X-rays, ultrasound, CT scans and other techniques may be used to diagnose pneumonia. A second test is sometimes used to confirm the diagnosis. How is it treated? That depends on what’s causing the infection. If it’s bacterial pneumonia — a blood, sputum or urine test can help identify the cause — your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic. And antifungals can help treat pneumonia caused by a fungal infection. Viral pneumonia usually isn’t treated with prescription medication. However, your doctor may recommend prescription or over-the-counter cold medicines or fever reducers to help with symptoms. Don’t ignore severe signs A fever that’s higher than 101 degrees F﻿. is concerning and is a sign you need to see a doctor, says Anthony Szema, M.D., who specializes in pulmonary diseases and clinical immunology at Hofstra/ Northwell on Long Island, New York. The same goes if you are short of breath﻿, or if your breathing worsens, or if you are extremely fatigued or feel dehydrated. “If you are wheezing and waking up at night with chest tightness, those are all reasons to seek medical care,” Kalsi says. It may be the case that your illness is severe enough to require extra care in the hospital. Preventing bronchitis and pneumonia The good news: You can do a few things to reduce your risk of coming down with bronchitis or pneumonia. The pneumococcal vaccine, which is now recommended for adults 50 and older, can help reduce the risk of pneumonia caused by pneumococcus bacteria. Similarly, the vaccines for COVID-19, RSV and influenza can lower the likelihood of those infections and the complications they can cause. And don’t forget about frequent handwashing and face masks, which can help block the spread of many germs, including those that can cause bronchitis and pneumonia. “The pandemic taught us how effective just wearing a mask can be,” says Kalsi, who adds that people with lung issues like asthma and emphysema will want to take extra precautions. Szema also recommends air purifiers using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in bedrooms and common rooms. These portable machines can help to remove germs from the air. Questions to ask — and to avoid If your doctor suspects your illness is caused by a virus, it’s important to not push for antibiotics if they aren’t recommended. Remember, antibiotics only help to treat bacterial infections. Still, “a lot of people request antibiotics for their bronchitis,” Kalsi says. Research suggests viruses cause 85 to 95 percent of acute bronchitis cases in healthy adults. Here are some questions you should be asking your doctor if you have a bad cough: Should I be concerned if I develop a fever?Do I need a chest X-ray or other medical tests?What’s the best course of treatment?Can I take over-the-counter medications with my routine prescription drugs?What should I do if symptoms linger?Are there any severe signs I need to be on the lookout for?

https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/dry-eyes-relief-treatment/,"7 Tips for Treating Dry Eyes Find relief from the pain, burning and redness, and get your tears back By Michelle Crouch, Updated October 09, 2023 AARP Comments En español Published July 22, 2021 / Updated October 09, 2023 KYLE ELLINGSON Eye Drops Recall The Food and Drug Administration recalled several brands of eye drops this year due to bacterial outbreaks and other contaminants. Find out more here. We wouldn’t blame you if the recent bacterial outbreak linked to several brands of over-the-counter eye drops has stopped you from using them. The news last winter was scary: Dozens of people were infected by the drug-resistant bacteria, including at least four patients who died and others who were blinded. Though the tainted products were recalled, they left behind uncertainty and hesitation.﻿ But eye experts would urge you to reconsider. “I definitely still recommend eye drops every day and take them myself for dry eye,” says Christopher Starr, M.D., a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medicine. The fact is, eye drops are one of the most effective remedies for dry eye. For a mild case, over-the-counter eye drops may be all you need, although your eye doctor can offer more treatment options. Here’s your step-by-step guide to getting relief. Take dry eyes seriously When your eyes are working correctly, they will constantly produce tears that keep the surface of the eye moist and comfortable. When you have dry eye, you either don’t produce enough tears or your tears evaporate too quickly because your oil glands are clogged. Left untreated, dry eye can lead to an infection, damage to your cornea or vision loss. An eye doctor can diagnose what’s causing your symptoms. Getty Images Common Causes of Dry Eye Medications, such as antidepressants, blood pressure drugs and sleep aids Laser, or refractive, eye surgery Age-related hormonal changes, including menopause Autoimmune conditions Contact lenses Clogged ducts Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke 1. Try eye drops and ointments Look for eye drops that say “lubrication” or “artificial tears,” not “redness relief.” Ointments and gels provide longer relief, but use only at night since they can blur vision. If you need drops more than four times a day, switch to preservative-free ones that come in single-use vials, or see your doctor for prescription drops.

Take a tech break When you use a computer or tablet, position the screen below eye level, take frequent breaks and try to remember to blink. Research shows you blink about 66 percent less than normal when you’re staring at a screen. Many doctors recommend stepping away every 20 minutes. 3. Unblock your oil glands Gently scrub lids and lashes with a mild cleanser twice a day. Getty Images Ducts along the edges of your eyelids generate oils to keep your tears from evaporating too fast. To help keep them flowing, wash your eyelids gently with baby shampoo or an eyelid cleanser, then lay a warm, moist washcloth on your eyes for a few minutes and lightly massage your eyelids. For stubborn cases, a doctor can perform an in-office procedure that uses heat or pulsed light to unblock glands. 4. Adapt your home environment A humidifier adds moisture to dry indoor air. Put one near your favorite chair and one near your bed when you sleep (keep the door shut), says Uyen Tran, M.D., a division chief at the Vanderbilt Eye Institute. Gently scrub lids and lashes with a mild cleanser twice a day. Getty Images 5. Move away from blowing air Air blowing into your eyes irritates your eyeballs and can cause tears to evaporate more quickly. A ceiling fan can dry out your eyes even while you sleep, Starr says. Point car vents away from your face, and move furniture you use often away from home HVAC vents. Throw on some wraparound sunglasses if you go outside on a windy day. 6. Try a different type of contact lens In most cases, contact lenses make dry eye worse. But ask your doctor about scleral lenses, which can help keep dry eyes hydrated, Tran says. “They have a water reservoir, so when you wear them, they constantly bathe your eyes in fluid.” 7. Get your ducts plugged A doctor can place “punctal plugs” into the tiny openings in the corner of your eye that normally drain your tears, a painless office procedure. “It’s like putting the stopper in the kitchen sink, so the tears you make don’t roll down the drain,” Tran says. ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

Ebenhack via AP; Getty Images; Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images; Shutterstock) Chrissy Bernal has caught COVID-19 three times, most recently in ­October 2023. “My symptoms were always pretty mild,” she says. But after her third round of the virus, she ­developed extreme allergies to foods she used to eat all the time: oats, dairy, gluten, sesame seeds and peanuts. “I literally have some level of anaphylaxis every single day,” she says. In May, Bernal, 46, a public relations professional in Houston, went into anaphylactic shock during a virtual meeting. “I had to inject myself with an Epi while everyone watched in horror on Zoom,” she says. Natalie Nichols, 53, has been struggling with debilitating asthma and severe food allergies since she first caught COVID more than three years ago. “Last fall, I spent ­two-and-a-half months confined to bed, ­motionless, because moving, including holding a cellphone, made me too short of breath,” she says. She’s also experienced brain fog, high blood pressure, hyper­glycemia, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. Nichols, the founder of a nonprofit in Nacogdoches, Texas, recently underwent surgery to repair joint damage caused by COVID-induced inflammation. Lorraine W., of Clarence Center, New York, was looking forward to an active retirement when she was diagnosed with COVID in March 2020. “I’ve never returned to my pre-COVID self,” says Lorraine, 65. She’s on medication to treat small blood vessel damage to her heart and continues to battle a lingering cough, fatigue and breathlessness, as well as kidney disease. Neurological changes have made her legs unsteady when she walks, requiring her to use balance poles. “None of these conditions were present before COVID,” Lorraine says. In June, the National Academies of ­Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a comprehensive definition of long COVID: “an infection-­associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least three months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” According to that definition, 18 million Americans have experienced long COVID; currently, more than 1 in 20 of us are living with its symptoms. Researchers have begun to link long-term COVID with another recent phenomenon: our shrinking life expectancy. The disease we’re forgetting COVID doesn’t seem that scary anymore. More than 98 percent of the U.S. population has some degree of immunity — from vaccination, prior infection or both — and Paxlovid and other medications are available to counteract acute symptoms. For many of us, contracting COVID is like having a bad ­upper respiratory infection. But “COVID isn’t gone,” says Ryan Hurt, M.D., director of the Long COVID Research and Clinical Program at the Mayo Clinic. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that COVID still kills at least 1,000 people every week around the globe — but “we only have data from about 40 countries,” says Maria Van Kerkhove, M.D., director of WHO’s Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention. Older adults and those with preexisting conditions remain among the most at-risk populations for severe, acute COVID. ­People 65 and older accounted for 63 percent of COVID-related hospitalizations and 88 percent of in-hospital deaths during the first seven months of 2023, according to CDC data. Although the dangers of acute COVID ­infection may have ebbed for many, the ­reality of long COVID is coming into view. Of those who contracted COVID-19 within the past four years, 10 to 20 percent have experienced long COVID. “With every new case of acute COVID [the initial phase of infection when diagnosed or symptoms first appear], there is risk for developing long COVID,” says Caitlin McAuley, D.O., a family physician at the Keck COVID Recovery Clinic in Los Angeles. She’s had patients who developed long COVID fully recover, get reinfected several times with no lingering effects, then develop another case that leads to a new bout of long COVID. She’s also seen patients who got COVID twice with no lingering effects, and the third time they ended up with prolonged symptoms. “We still have a number of individuals who had the first wave of COVID who are suffering from long COVID symptoms now, several of them many years out,” says Jerrold Kaplan, M.D., medical director of the COVID Rehabilitation and Recovery Program at Gaylord Specialty Healthcare in Connecticut. Having escaped long COVID previously doesn’t mean you won’t face it in the future. Indeed, some research has suggested that catching multiple COVID-19 strains puts you at increased risk. A study published in 2022 found that reinfection can increase the risk of complications in major organ systems, and these risks persist at least six months beyond the initial infection. We don’t yet know the true impact of catching COVID. “Many chronic disease processes, such as cardiovascular disease, dementia and cancer, take years to develop. And whether acute COVID-19 puts people at risk for some of these issues? Time will tell,” Hurt says. What doctors do know is that patients are flocking to their offices complaining of symptoms they never had before COVID. Is long COVID boosting our death rate? In July, COVID accounted for less than 1 ­percent of all deaths in the U.S. Life expectancy in the U.S. is 77.5 years, reflecting an uptick over the past two years but still lower than prepandemic levels. Many factors contribute to that statistic, but it’s clear that the long-term effects of COVID have played a role. For example, a study in the journal Nature Medicine found that those hospitalized with COVID had a 29 percent greater risk of death in the three years after their infection. “But what was also alarming is that in people who weren’t hospitalized, there was also an increased risk of a variety of medical issues,” says John Baratta, founder and codirector of the COVID Recovery Clinic at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Even patients who’d had mild bouts of COVID-19 had an increased risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological issues lingering for three years after the initial infection. Long COVID patients had a significantly increased risk of severe health issues affecting the brain, lungs and heart. We have long known that an acute case of COVID can compromise heart health: Compared with those who didn’t contract COVID, people who caught the virus were 81 percent more likely to die of a cardiovascular complication in the ensuing three weeks, according to a study of 160,000 patients published by the European Society of Cardiology. But the risk lingers long after the symptoms abate. Those who caught the virus were five times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease as long as 18 months after infection, the same study found. Heart disease deaths, which had been on a downward trend for decades, began to spike in 2020 and remained high through 2022, the last year for which data is available. Stroke, blood clots in the legs leading to clots in the lungs, abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and inflammation of the heart are among the challenges COVID poses, says Mohanakrishnan Sathyamoorthy, M.D., professor and chair of internal medicine at the Burnett School of Medicine in Fort Worth, Texas. In long COVID, this collection of cardiovascular disruptions can present as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), in which patients’ heart rates increase abnormally when they go from sitting or ­lying down to standing up. One theory to explain COVID’s long-term effect on the heart — and the body in general — centers on inflammation. “Every time you get infected with COVID, there is a possible increased risk of long COVID, and some cardiac disorders can occur — especially if you have a history of heart disease, including stroke, heart disease and heart attacks,” says Pragna Patel, M.D., senior adviser for long COVID at the CDC. All of these problems can be exacerbated by the virus entering coronary tissue and triggering inflammatory responses that can damage the heart. Researchers say COVID may also alter the gut microbiome, a primary controller of inflammation, thereby triggering the immune system to rev up the condition. “There is no single agreed-upon mechanism that’s causing the issues,” Baratta says. “An individual may have multiple factors going on in their body, and not everyone will have the same underlying mechanism causing their symptoms,” which increases the complexity of both research and treatment. One factor that seems to matter: vaccination status. “Several studies show that vaccination can decrease the risk of developing long COVID,” Patel says. Vaccination rates tend to increase with age, with people 75 and older being the most well vaccinated — hence the most well protected from long COVID, Patel theorizes. That may explain why long COVID most commonly affects people ages 35 to 64; the risk seems to drop for those 65-plus, according to CDC data. From long covid diagnosis to treatment No single test can determine whether a ­person has long COVID. Doctors typically diagnose long COVID by reviewing the ­patient’s health history and current symptoms and trying to rule out other causes. A positive COVID test is not required, as someone could have been infected without knowing it, then experience strange symptoms later, Patel says. Though there are many ongoing clinical trials on long COVID, there is no umbrella treatment. Primary care physicians address what they can, then call in specialists — such as a cardiologist to handle arrhythmia or a therapist to treat anxiety — for more targeted care. There are long COVID centers around the country where teams of professionals work to help patients through their unique symptoms. “Because the effects of COVID are so wide throughout the body and mind, there will not be a single treatment for all long COVID issues,” Baratta says. “This is ­going to be treated by many different types of providers and specialists, and it will be treated, often, symptom by symptom.” Long COVID is recognized as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act if it substantially limits one or more major life activities. About 200 symptoms fall ­under that umbrella, Patel says. Here are some of the conditions we’re learning can linger months and, in some cases, years beyond an acute COVID infection. If these or other health changes seem familiar, consult your primary care physician. 1. Extreme fatigue It’s common to experience fatigue when your body is busy fighting off an illness. But some people still struggle with fatigue long after their initial COVID infection. In fact, a lack of energy is the number one symptom reported by long COVID patients. In some, this can be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome, which has been on the rise since the start of the pandemic, Baratta says. He defines this as “a disabling level of fatigue that severely limits daily activities.” This lingering fatigue may be due to limited production of energy within the muscles caused by damage to the mitochondria from a COVID infection. It can happen to anyone — no matter their level of fitness before infection. “I’ve treated patients who have been triathletes and now may only be able to do 15 or 20 minutes of exercise a day, when they’re used to running and swimming miles at a time,” Kaplan says. He recommends starting slow and pacing yourself with everything you do around the house, “doing shorter intervals several times throughout the day, rather than trying to do everything at once.” Whether it gets better depends on the individual. Some people’s symptoms clear, and some people may battle them indefinitely. 2. Shortness of breath An analysis of chest CT scans from 144 patients ages 27 to 80 found that more than one-third of people hospitalized with a previous COVID infection had lung scarring and thickening two years after coming into contact with the virus. Even patients with milder cases who walked away without scarring can experience changes in their breathing. “Some research shows that people ­after COVID start to take shorter, shallower breaths,” Baratta says. “This essentially causes a type of hyperventilation they are doing without even recognizing it, not getting good fresh air deep into the lungs, and [this] can lead to shortness of breath.” ​ Doctors have found success using respiratory exercises to help patients relearn slow, deep breathing. 3. Cognitive changes Difficulty concentrating, spaciness and forgetfulness are just a few of the brain challenges COVID can bring on. These can last for weeks or months or — in some with long COVID — become an everyday occurrence that lasts indefinitely. COVID may linger in a person’s gut long after an infection, altering their microbiome and hindering the body’s ability to produce serotonin, leading to cognitive disturbances. COVID may also disrupt the blood-brain barrier, allowing chemicals or molecules in the rest of the body to enter the brain blood circulation and potentially lead to brain fog, Baratta says. One study found that 30 days after testing positive for COVID-19, people were at greater risk for cognitive decline, as well as for mental health disorders including anxiety, depression and stress. Another study found inflammation in the brains of people with mild to moderate COVID-19 was similar to the effects of seven years of aging. Doctors are leading neurologically affected patients through cognitive rehabilitation exercises that show promise in reducing symptoms. 4. Depression and anxiety “Mood-related disorders are one of the top five issues that happen to people after COVID,” Baratta says. There may be a direct relationship between the virus’s effect on the brain and mood issues. A 2021 review of eight studies found that 12 weeks after a COVID infection, 11 to 28 ­percent of people had depression symptoms, and 3 to 12 percent of those individuals reported their symptoms as severe. If you’re feeling more stressed or down after catching COVID, tell your primary care physician, who can refer you to a therapist. Or visit the American Psychological Association’s search tool at locator.apa.org to find a qualified therapist in your area. 5. Sleep disturbances Nearly 40 percent of people with long COVID have reported major changes to their sleep patterns. One study looked at 1,056 COVID-19 patients who did not have a severe enough infection to require hospitalization. Of that population, 76.1 percent reported having insomnia and 22.8 percent severe insomnia. Sleep ­apnea may also appear post-COVID, another way the disease affects the respiratory system. Talk to your doctor if you’re having sleep issues. A CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine can help with sleep ­apnea. Lifestyle habits that prioritize healthy sleep, such as keeping consistent sleep and wake times and avoiding large meals before bed, may also help. “Post-COVID sleep has literally been a nightmare! We saw a 23 percent increase in sleeping-pill prescription during and post-COVID,” says Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist and clinical sleep specialist in Los Angeles. 6. Digestive upset Diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating and gas: These symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome can be by-products of an encounter with COVID. A survey of 729 COVID survivors found that 29 percent experienced at least one new chronic GI symptom six months after their infection. “There is evidence that parts of the COVID virus linger in the GI tract for many months after the initial illness, and it’s been suggested that the presence of these ongoing viral fragments causes dysfunction or problems with the GI tract, leading to mostly symptoms of diarrhea and gastric distress and discomfort,” Baratta says. Talk to your doctor about any new digestive symptoms or seek help from a gastro­enterologist. You can keep a food journal and note if your condition flares after eating certain foods. Try cutting out those foods, then reintroducing them one by one to see what you react to, Kaplan advises. 7. New or worsened allergies Some people who develop COVID experience allergies they never had before. One study found the risk of ­developing allergic diseases, such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, rose significantly within the first 30 days after a COVID diagnosis. This may be because one’s immune system stays hypervigilant after fighting the virus, McAuley says. In severe cases, like Chrissy Bernal’s, this can lead to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a disease that can behave like a series of severe allergies: The body’s cells become hypersensitive, causing strong ­reactions to everything from food and pollen to even a hot shower or exercise. Antihistamines and other medications may help, so talk to your doctor if you experience skin itching, a rapid pulse, wheezing or gastro­intestinal symptoms. 8. Pain Some COVID survivors battle chronic pain, everything from aching joints to testicular pain. There is a higher risk of inflammatory arthritis, and women are at higher risk than men. One review of studies estimated that 10 percent of people who contracted COVID experienced musculo­skeletal pain at some point during the first year after infection. Reducing stress, eating a healthy diet and exercising may ease some post-COVID ­discomfort. Massage therapy, movement therapy, acupuncture and over-the-counter pain medications may also offer relief. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist, such as a rheumatologist, who can help manage symptoms including joint pain. Fast-moving research means new hope If your symptoms last after a bout of COVID, start with your primary care physician, who can help treat your symptoms or refer you to a specialist. Despite previous dismissals, long COVID is more recognized these days, Patel says, and the CDC is doing its part to educate both patients and providers. And initiatives such as the National Institutes of Health’s Recover program are researching treatment options. “In a year, things will look different, because research is moving so quickly,” says Sara F. Martin, M.D., medical director of the Adult Post-Acute COVID Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The CDC, for instance, is funding a series of clinical trials that the NIH has in the works. This new information, Martin says, may guide doctors, including herself, who treat long COVID ­patients to better ease their symptoms.
